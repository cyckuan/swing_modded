<HEADLINE> Biotech Firm Buys Cloning Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Asociated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Geron Corp., a small biotech firm, has  
bought Roslin Bio-Med, the company formed by the Scottish 
scientists who cloned Dolly the sheep, putting researchers in three 
promising areas of genetic engineering under one corporate roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of patents owned by the two companies should  
attract new partners, adding to Geron's $49 million investment, 
executives at the Menlo Park-based company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Individually, the companies' technologies ``have the potential  
to significantly improve our ability to treat and even cure many 
diseases. Together, that potential is enhanced dramatically,'' said 
Dr. Ian Wilmut, who created Dolly and will lead the Geron research 
with collaborator John Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Geron has patented breakthrough technologies in the use of stem  
cells from human embryos, which it hopes can be grown into tissues 
for use as transplants. It also has patented a way of cloning the 
``cellular immortalizing enzyme,'' which enables otherwise mortal 
cells to replicate and live on extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	Roslin patented the method scientists around the world now use  
to clone animals. The new Geron subsidiary will combine the three 
patented methods and try to generate genetically matched human 
cells and tissues that can be replicated extensively and used to 
repair organ damage from degenerative diseases such as diabetes, 
Parkinson's disease, cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	If Geron Bio-Med's theories prove successful, someone needing a  
transplant could get customized tissues grown in the lab that would 
not require anti-rejection drugs, said Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's 
vice president for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, given the patents held by Geron and Roslin, if such  
a process proves profitable, ``We have it locked up,'' Okarma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Evan Snyder, an expert in stem-cell research at Harvard  
University, called Geron Bio-Med's research ``exciting in terms of 
its prospects,'' but he scoffed at Okarma's assertion that the 
company will own a new generation of genetic engineering 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always leery of anyone who claims that they've cornered  
the market on the key to repairing organs, that there's no other 
way of doing it without having to go through them. I don't think 
that's true,'' Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geron bought all outstanding shares of Roslin Bio-Med for 2.1  
million shares of Geron common stock, worth roughly $28 million 
Tuesday. Geron also is investing about $21 million in applied 
research at the new subsidiary, and is looking for new business 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be difficult, if such investors aren't willing to wait  
years before realizing any profits, said Caroline Copithorne, an 
analyst who follows the biotech industry for Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've now done is capture a lot of potential, having  
the patents, but it's so far from getting to products, you're not 
going to get a lot of investor interest today,'' she added. 
``There's a lot of interesting science and patents that never 
become a product.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday amid  
worries the Japanese government won't expand efforts to revive 
Japan's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the euro in muted trading after the new  
currency recovered from troubling remarks by the European Union's 
chief central banker. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.85  
Japanese yen, up from 120.31 yen late Monday. The euro rose against 
the dollar, trading at $1.0617, up from $1.0567. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders bought dollars and sold yen after Japanese Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi, during a state visit in Washington on 
Monday, said that he saw no need for further programs to jump start 
his country's recessionary economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Without more help, analysts said, Japanese financial  
institutions might fail to recover despite government steps such as 
authorizing funds for yen-starved banks that undertake certain 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what caused the dollar to break'' higher into 120 yen  
territory, rising during trading as high as 121.28 yen, said Thomas 
Arnold, chief foreign exchange dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro fell after reports quoting Wim Duisenberg,  
president of the European Central Bank, as saying ``there are no 
concerns'' about the euro's weakness against the dollar. The ECB 
issues the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grant Wilson, a foreign exchange analyst at Mellon Bank in  
Pittsburgh, said traders are sure that individual European central 
banks have been quietly intervening on the euro's behalf, buying 
enough small amounts to bolster the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, traders reconsidered their positions and  
bought more euros, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5110 Swiss francs, down from 1.5236;  
and 1.4529 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4470 late Monday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6292, up from $1.6093. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8422 German 
marks, down from 1.8508; 6.1784 French francs, down from 6.2073; 
and 1,823.74 Italian lire, up from 1,831.50.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Circulation Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite some gains by larger newspapers, overall  
daily newspaper circulation declined by 0.5 percent in the six 
months ending in March, an industry association reported. Sunday 
circulation fell by 1.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The top ten papers with circulations over half a million  
reported a gain of 0.02 percent over the same six-month period a 
year ago, according to data released by the Audit Bureau of 
Circulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading papers reporting circulation increases included USA  
Today, The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles 
Times, Newsday and the Daily News of New York. The Chicago Tribune 
reported gains in its Wednesday, Thursday and Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller papers generally reported declines. According to an  
analysis of the Audit Bureau's data by the Newspaper Association of 
America, the 30 papers with circulations between 250,000 and 
500,000 posted a decline of 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67 papers between 100,000 and 250,000 daily circulation  
declined 0.1 percent, and the 111 papers between 50,000 and 100,000 
declined by 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned by the long-term decline in newspaper readership, the  
Newspaper Association has launched an effort to boost readership at 
a time when consumers face more choices for getting news. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the NAA's campaign was officially launched  
last week at the group's annual convention under the guidance of 
Sergio Zyman, a former marketing executive for Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on the ABC figures, NAA president and CEO John F.  
Sturm said: ``The newspaper industry is strong financially. Now, we 
recognize both the need and the opportunity to invest our resources 
in growing readership. Our concerns over stagnant circulation and 
readership figures were the impetus behind the industry-wide 
Readership Initiative, designed to build our share of audience and 
advertising.''

	43 Die in Midwest Tornadoes  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The death toll stood at 43 today after  
tornadoes destroyed entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
Oklahoma City assistant fire chief Jon Hansen said the damage 
``looks like the Murrah Building,'' which was destroyed in a 1995 
bombing. The number of houses destroyed in the Oklahoma City area 
approached 2,000. Hospitals in the metro area treated 563 people 
for tornado-related injuries, police said. President Clinton 
declared 11 Oklahoma counties and one in Kansas federal disaster 
areas. Crews were seeking survivors and cleaning up damage.

	Willey Says Clinton Was 'Forceful'  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Former White House volunteer Kathleen  
Willey testified today that President Clinton was ``very forceful'' 
in an unwanted sexual advance in 1993. Mrs. Willey testified for 
the prosecution in the trial of her former friend, Julie Hiatt 
Steele. She said Clinton backed her against a wall and ``tried to 
kiss me. He was very forceful. His hands were all over me.'' 
Clinton has denied the allegation under oath. Ms. Steele is charged 
with lying to investigators to undercut Mrs. Willey's story.

	American Jet Downs Yugoslav Fighter  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A MiG-29 fighter jet was shot down  
by NATO in a dogfight over Serbia today. As NATO claimed its most 
successful attacks, the alliance's top general acknowledged the 
airstrikes have failed to stem the ethnic cleansing campaign in 
Kosovo. Gen. Klaus Naumann, head of NATO's military arm, said the 
air operation ``has slowed down the efforts of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's instruments for ethnic cleansing'' but ``we 
cannot stop such a thing entirely.'' Milosevic today met with 
several top army commanders, and said the Kosovo Liberation Army 
had been ``fully defeated.''

	Freed POW Thanked Serb Guards  
</P>
<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Freed American POW Christopher Stone  
gave his Serbian guards a thank you note before he and two other 
servicemen were released. The Pentagon said today that Stone's note 
thanked the guards for the way they treated him. Also today, 
doctors at a U.S. military hospital gave the three servicemen clean 
bills of health, saying no further medical care was needed. The 
soldiers were being given 30 days of leave, then were likely to 
return to their units based in Germany. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Heads to Europe for Update  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton headed to NATO headquarters  
in Belgium today for an update on the air campaign in Yugoslavia as 
Russia's mediator for the Balkans persisted in opposing the allied 
bombardment and a proposed heavily armed peacekeeping force for 
Kosovo. Before departing, Clinton welcomed ``every diplomatic 
possibility for the Serbian authorities to meet the requirements 
NATO has articulated,'' but insisted that he would not back away 
from the alliance's demands, particularly on the issue of returning 
refugees to Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Honors Rosa Parks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a bill today to give  
civil rights heroine Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal. The 
move will bestow Congress' highest recognition on the 86-year-old 
Parks, whose refusal in December 1955 to give up her seat to a 
white man in Montgomery, Ala., inspired civil rights advocates 
across the country. Parks' arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott led 
by Martin Luther King Jr. and provoked a Supreme Court challenge to 
Montgomery's segregation law.

	Goldman Sachs Shares Up 43 Percent

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly minted shares of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.  
soared 33 percent in their first day of trading today as investors 
welcomed Wall Street's elite investment bank into the public arena. 
Goldman's shares, which trade under the symbol GS, rose to $70.37 1/2, 
a gain of $17.37 1/2 from the $53 price set in yesterday's initial 
public offering of stock. The jump gave Goldman a market value of 
$38.6 billion, instantly making the company worth more than Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mickey Morandini's shallow ninth-inning fly fell  
in for a game-winning single today as the Chicago Cubs blew a 
six-run lead and then rallied twice to beat the Colorado Rockies 
13-12. The Cubs hit five homers but trailed 12-11 in the ninth 
after Colorado's Darryl Hamilton hit an RBI single off Rod Beck 
(2-2). Jose Hernandez walked off Jerry DiPoto (0-1) to start the 
ninth and scored on Tyler Houston's RBI double to right center. 
Lance Johnson grounded out with Houston moving to third and 
Morandini's fly into right center fell in front of Larry Walker.

<HEADLINE> Car Hits Schoolyard; 2 Toddlers Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- A Cadillac plowed into a crowd of  
children outside a day care center, killing two toddlers and 
injuring five other people. Witnesses said the driver appeared to 
act deliberately, and he was arrested for investigation of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Allen Abrams, 39, of Santa Ana may have been upset with  
the Southcoast Early Childhood Learning Center and intentionally 
crashed the car through a fence and into the schoolyard Monday 
evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He accelerated to about 35 mph to 40 mph and right when he got  
to the preschool, he made a sharp turn, and what witnesses say was 
intentional, ran into the schoolyard,'' Lt. Ron Smith said. The car 
came to a stop under a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they found Abrams in a daze behind the wheel but  
said there were no signs that he was under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol. Police found no skid marks or other evidence that 
Abrams tried to stop the brown 1967 Cadillac, and Smith said he 
didn't express any remorse afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams was led away in handcuffs past a crowd of angry  
neighbors, parents and workers from a nearby church who jeered at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel so helpless because you can't pull them out,'' said  
Adam Brown, a youth pastor from the Lighthouse Coastal Community 
Church, across the street from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4-year-old girl, Sierra Soto, was pinned under the car and  
died at the scene. A 3-year-old boy, identified by the coroner as 
Brandon Wiener, was transported to Hoag Hospital but died about an 
hour after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams was arrested on investigation of murder, said Sgt. Bob  
Ciszek. The investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what his reasons were,'' Smith said late Monday.  
``There may be an indication that something went on there between 
him and the people who worked there about four to five years ago.'' 
Police said they didn't believe he had a child attending the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Southcoast officials were unavailable for comment, said a woman  
who answered the school's phone who declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the injured, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, were  
listed in critical condition at Western Medical Center in Santa 
Ana. A a 24-year-old teacher's aide was in fair condition at 
another hospital, while two toddlers were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tragedy, Randi Rubenstein sat on the steps outside one  
hospital and cradled her 2-year-old daughter, who narrowly missed 
being hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God she's OK,'' Ms. Rubinstein said repeatedly, rocking  
her child back and forth.

<HEADLINE> Limited Spinning Off Girls Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with strong earnings projected for the  
first half of this year, The Limited Inc. isn't staying put in the 
highly competitive retail business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer Monday announced plans to spin  
off its very successful Limited Too girls clothing chain this 
summer and sell its majority interest in its Galyan's Trading Co. 
sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited, which said it should beat analysts' earnings  
estimates for the first two quarters of 1999, also plans to buy 
back up to 15 million shares of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong earnings forecast, which came after financial markets  
closed, is the latest evidence that the Limited is on the road to 
recovery after an aggressive restructuring effort has helped get 
the struggling retailing giant back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we've been waiting for at the Limited,'' said  
Maura Hunter Byrne, a retail analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost customers in the mid-1990s to other merchants  
who offered more casual, classic clothes and lower prices. But the 
Limited has worked hard to win back shoppers by improving its 
fashion offerings and coming up with fresh retailing concepts -- 
like Limited Too and Bath &AMP; Body Works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited said it expects first-quarter earnings per share of  
14 cents, a 56 percent gain from 9 cents a year ago and above the 
10 cents expected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company attributed the gains to strength at its Limited Too  
stores, its Express and Lerner New York chains, which cater to 
young women looking for trendy styles; its large-size Lane Bryant 
stores; and its Intimate Brands division, which includes Victoria's 
Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the earnings news, the Limited announced its  
plans to spin off Limited Too to shareholders in late July or 
August 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected such a move, given the 319-store chain's  
great success in recent years. Sales have grown from $259 million 
in 1996 to $377 million in 1998, and its profits have significantly 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Geared for girls ages 7 to 14, Limited Too stores are filled  
with trendy merchandise, such as nail polish in outrageous colors, 
funky accessories and hip clothing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited Too spinoff follows a similar move by the Limited  
last year with Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the casual apparel retailer 
aimed at teens and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it allows (Limited Too) to pursue their growth  
initiatives unhindered by us,'' said Tom Katzenmeyer, vice 
president of investor relations at the Limited. He added that the 
plans for the Limited Too include a catalog and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited also announced that it will sell its majority stake  
in Galyan's to the investment firm of Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co. The 
deal, which is expected to close this summer, will leave the 
Limited with a 40 percent stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited expects to receive about $190 million from sale of  
Gaylan's, which operates 16 stores and had revenues of $220 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the stock buyback, Limited shareholders can sell a portion  
or all of their shares to the company at a price no less than $50 a 
share and no more than $55 a share. The buyback will commence on 
May 4 and continue until June 1.

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Accident investigators believe excessive  
speed and alcohol might have contributed to the death of Carolina 
Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Chiasson was killed early Monday after he lost  
control of his pickup truck on a north Raleigh road. Chiasson, who 
wasn't wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the vehicle when it 
rolled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Highway Patrol said Chiasson was traveling above the 55-mph  
speed limit. Trooper K.L. Horne said he was awaiting results of a 
blood test before commenting on whether alcohol played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has not been ruled out, but it has not been confirmed,''  
he told The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne said the official accident report would be available  
today, but that results of a blood-alcohol test will not be 
available for 2-3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Team members and members of Chiasson's family planned to hold a  
private memorial service for him today. The team will fly to Canada 
for Chiasson's funeral, tentatively scheduled for Thursday or 
Friday. It will be held in Peterborough, Ontario, the small town 
near Toronto where Chiasson grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened about 4:15 a.m., just hours after the  
Hurricanes were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs in a 2-0 
loss at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Chris Brown said two cases of beer and water,  
sports drinks, milk and vegetable juice were served on the team's 
charter flight from Boston to Raleigh. He didn't know how much 
beer, if any, Chiasson drank. 
</P>
<P>
	After the plane landed about 1 a.m. at Raleigh-Durham  
International Airport, the players got into their vehicles and 
dispersed, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the team told The News &AMP; Observer that  
Chiasson and some other players went to a player's home after the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck came almost two years after an automobile accident  
involving Chiasson's former Detroit Red Wings teammate Vladimir 
Konstantinov, Detroit's Vyacheslav Fetisov and the team masseur. 
The three were injured in June 1997 after a celebration of the Red 
Wings' first Stanley Cup in 42 years, won six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov sustained severe head injuries that ended his  
career, and the masseur, Sergei Mnatsakanov, also was seriously 
injured. Fetisov had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday, team officials already trying to  
cope with being eliminated from the playoffs said they had lost a 
family member. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you work together in our environment, you have a family  
among players and an extended family among wives and children that 
go to school together and play on sports teams together,'' Carolina 
coach Paul Maurice said. ``.... It's a very painful time for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that is impossible to put into words,'' said  
Jim Rutherford, president and general manager of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Red Wings before being  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and then, in 1997, to the 
Hartford Whalers, who later became the Hurricanes. He played in his 
first NHL All-Star game in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was a member of the Red Wings' family for several years  
and continued to be a close friend to individual players and staff, 
as well as the organization,'' the Detroit team said. ``We are 
deeply saddened by this tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Steve's family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson had shoulder surgery in January and played in only 28  
regular season games, scoring once and adding eight assists. The 
surgery was expected to end his season, but he returned to play all 
six playoff games for the Hurricanes, scoring a goal and two 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, two sons and a  
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a young life ends prematurely, when a young family loses  
a husband and a father, words cannot begin to express our sorrow,'' 
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said.

<HEADLINE> Bush May Stay in Texas a Bit Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush might be willing to stay on  
his front porch a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has vowed to stay in Texas until the Legislature  
adjourns May 31, tentatively is scheduled to travel to Iowa and New 
Hampshire -- key presidential battlegrounds -- in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has told lawmakers that he is willing to convene a  
special session to secure approval of his $2 billion property tax 
cut proposal, officials who were in the meetings said. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker told the Austin-American Statesman that Bush said:  
``My front porch strategy is working well enough that I may as well 
stay here for the summer.'' The lawmaker couldn't say whether Bush 
was making a threat or a simple comment, according to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawmaker involved in talks with Bush, House Ways and Means  
Committee Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, said he thinks 
Bush was joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor joked about he was ready to stay here all summer  
if he needed to be, but I think that was meant in jest. We're all 
trying to work this out and we're going to work it out,'' Oliveira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While other candidates are out on the hustings, Bush has been in  
Austin, saying that's where he needed to be while the legislature 
was in session. 
</P>
<P>
	Special session or not, it's a win-win situation for Bush. If he  
gets the tax cut before the session ends May 31, he can go to Iowa 
and New Hampshire as planned, with bragging rights. If he doesn't, 
he can stay home and say he's fighting for lower taxes, delaying 
his entry into the campaign fray. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Bush  
retained a big lead nationally in the race for the Republican 
presidential nomination, despite a bit of slippage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was favored by 42 percent, followed by Elizabeth Dole at 24  
percent. In mid-April, Bush led Dole by a 53-16 margin. The poll of 
411 Republicans has an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes said the governor believes  
lawmakers have sufficient time to finish their business. ``Governor 
Bush remains confident that the Legislature has adequate time to 
fund improvements to our public schools and enact major tax cuts 
between now and the end of the regular session,'' she said, 
refusing to confirm whether Bush raised the possibility of a 
special session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved a bill supporters say would cut property  
taxes by about $1 billion; House lawmakers are looking at an 
alternative that would trim taxes about $500 million. Both plans 
would increase teacher pay and state spending on schools.

<HEADLINE> The Changing Face of Robots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Last Christmas' hottest toy is Exhibit A  
at a high-tech robot conference this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Furby -- a fuzzy robot that talks, learns, and interacts with  
people and other Furbies that was the rage this past holiday season 
-- is just the beginning of ``autonomous agent'' technology. 
</P>
<P>
	At the third annual Conference on Autonomous Agents, researchers  
presented dozens of computer programs and systems that can think, 
learn, and act independently of their human creators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Furby is a simple toy, but researchers say the eventual  
applications of the technology will be far-reaching and grand. 
</P>
<P>
	The presentations ranged from practical to whimsical, including  
robotic dogs, self-navigating spacecraft, e-mail organizers, 
smarter Internet search engines, and interactive teaching programs 
that even spring pop quizzes. Scientists say these ideas are all 
very real and very possible with current technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference participants were buzzing Tuesday about a  
presentation called ``Model-based Autonomous Systems in Deep 
Space.'' The Deep Space 1 unmanned probe was launched in October, 
bound for an asteroid 120 million miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, NASA will start testing the spacecraft's autonomous  
system. Instead of people at Ground Control telling the probe what 
to do, Deep Space's computer system will create a list of goals, 
draw up a schedule and perform it, NASA computer scientist Gregory 
Dorais said. If something goes wrong, the system is equipped with 
enough knowledge to fix problems without help from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The distance between Earth and the probe is so vast that it can  
take 15 minutes for NASA controllers to receive word that 
something's wrong and correct it, Dorais said. That 15 minutes of 
delay can doom a mission, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With autonomous software, more can be done and it can be done  
more safely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on Earth, autonomous software is being put to more everyday  
uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Segal, an IBM researcher, demonstrated a program that  
helps sort e-mail. Existing programs put mail into folders before 
it's been read. But the IBM program, called MailCat, uses a 
different approach. MailCat reads through folders and reads 
incoming mail to determine which folder is the right one. A box 
pops up above the e-mail message, giving the user three choices of 
where to put it. That way, Segal said, fewer e-mails get misfiled. 
</P>
<P>
	A prototype of MailCat may be available within a few months,  
Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the horizon is an Internet search engine called Watson,  
the Ph.D. project of Jay Budzik from Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're writing a paper, Watson can actually read the work in  
progress and then search the Internet for information relevant to 
your topic -- without any guidance from you. 
</P>
<P>
	``It presents results to the user in an unobtrusive way that's  
really manageable to use,'' Budzik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson works with Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer.  
</P>
<P>
	This year's conference was sponsored in part by the Association  
for Computing Machinery. Jeffrey Bradshaw of Boeing Co., one of the 
organizers, said the sessions are more practical than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a lot more stuff making it into the real world,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the speakers include Bill Joy, chief scientist of  
Sun Microsystems Inc., and Microsoft Corp. research director Dan 
Ling: ``It shows that the big folks worrying about software are 
very interested in what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Autonomous agents are coming to the forefront, Bradshaw said, in  
part because of the unwieldiness of information on the Internet. 
Ordinary Web browsers often aren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't browse and click and find what you want on the  
Internet,'' Bradshaw said. ``You need something more intelligent 
and smarter to find what you want.''

<HEADLINE> At Least 43 Die in Plains Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Rescue crews looking for signs of life  
picked through shattered homes, twisted trees and mangled cars 
Tuesday after a swarm of astonishingly powerful tornadoes chewed up 
entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and Kansas and killed at least 43 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an area accustomed to tornadoes and damaging  
thunderstorms -- this is, after all, the region known as Tornado 
Alley -- the twisters' wrath was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	One monstrous funnel cloud skipped across the ground for four  
hours and was classified F-5, the most powerful tornado there is, 
with winds of more than 260 mph. It cut a path one mile wide and 
tore up 60 miles of the flat countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' said Eric Peterson of Haysville, Kan., a  
suburb of Wichita, after a twister pushed a tree into his bedroom. 
``I have been in typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, 
but this tops it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll was 38 in Oklahoma and five in Kansas, making  
this the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak since 42 people were 
killed last year in Florida. It was also the deadliest such tragedy 
to hit Oklahoma since April 9, 1947, when a twister killed 113 
people in Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were injured, including 500 in Oklahoma City and more  
than 100 in Wichita, Kan. At least 1,500 businesses and homes were 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars were tossed across highways and crushed like soda cans.  
Houses were smashed into piles of timbers and brick. The ground was 
scoured bare in places, stripped of trees. The air smelled like 
sawdust. Baby pictures floated down the streets in storm water. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City, likened  
the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing in 1995: ``It looks like 
the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories tall, it's spread 
out over a large area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the death toll could have been worse if people  
had not heeded warnings to take cover underground. Local TV 
stations went live with coverage of the developing storm at least 
two hours before it hit the heavily populated Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating estimated that hundreds of millions  
of dollars of damage was done. He mobilized the National Guard to 
help with the rescue, and tanks joined police and fire vehicles in 
blocking streets where the heaviest destruction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers conducted two preliminary searches for victims, then  
brought in bulldozers to clear away heavy debris in a third search 
during the afternoon. At least one woman was found alive in a 
trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be someone, somewhere, still out there, under the  
clutter,'' said John Vears, one of the hundreds of volunteer 
searchers and emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Knapp, a Red Cross volunteer at an evacuation shelter in  
Newcastle, said she was taking her son to T-ball practice Monday 
afternoon but turned around when a funnel cloud came into view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in several of them in my lifetime. But this was a  
big one,'' she said. ``This did more damage than I've ever seen in 
my life. There are dead cattle in people's yard, trees, debris. 
Grass was ripped up. At some homes, the foundations were ripped 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Smith was visiting her grandparents when a tornado tore  
through her neighborhood in Midwest City, just outside Oklahoma 
City. She spent Tuesday rummaging through the remains of what once 
was her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got here, I could only tell it was our house because  
of the bushes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Poahty was still in shock as she looked at her neighbor's  
car, which had been hurled into her living room. Her son's mattress 
was in a tree and the family car was 100 yards away in a neighbor's 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
	She was able to salvage something, however: She found a small  
black bag on the floor, opened it and pulled out a glass bottle. 
``My perfume survived,'' she said. ``It was my favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated the tornadoes traveled as much as 80 miles  
after forming 45 miles south of Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon. 
Over the next 20 hours, as many as four dozen tornadoes developed. 
The same system spawned the Kansas tornado, which struck about 8:30 
p.m. Monday. It cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
At least 150 houses and 27 businesses were damaged or destroyed in 
Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Zehr, 44, figured he would be safe inside the  
cinderblock warehouse where he was working when the tornado struck 
Haysville. Then he rose 4 feet in the air, and dropped back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I couldn't breathe,'' he recalled, marveling  
at how he survived with merely a bruised finger. ``The wind was 
knocked out of me. The roof fell on me. The wall fell on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared disaster areas in 11 Oklahoma  
counties and one Kansas county and plans to tour the devastation 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the surreal images in the aftermath of the storm:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In a high school parking lot next to a row of flattened  
houses, a dead gray horse lay between cars after being been blown 
in from the surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Officials reported that part of a wing apparently snapped off  
a small plane parked at a rural airport and drifted for 40 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Knerr, 73, sat in the Midwest City Senior Center early  
Tuesday, mud-stained and slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the war in Germany. I've had bombs fall all  
around me. Now I've been in a tornado,'' she said. ``It's a feeling 
I can't describe. Everything was falling on me, two-by-fours and 
insulation.''

<HEADLINE>  Apache Crashes in Training Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A MiG-29 fighter jet, the finest in  
Yugoslavia's air force, was shot down by NATO in a dogfight over 
Serbia on Tuesday. As NATO claimed its most successful attacks, the 
alliance's top general acknowledged the airstrikes have failed to 
stem the ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Klaus Naumann, a German four-star general and retiring head  
of NATO's military arm, said the air operation ``has slowed down 
the efforts of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's instruments 
for ethnic cleansing'' but ``we cannot stop such a thing 
entirely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said, ``Milosevic's mass deportation campaign appears  
achievable,'' adding that while the Yugoslav leader cannot defeat 
NATO, he might be able to ``completely force ethnic Albanians 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The briefing was Naumann's last before he completes his  
three-year tour as chairman of the NATO Military Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, an Apache helicopter crashed during a training  
mission early Wednesday 45 miles northeast of the airport in 
Tirana, the capital. The were no initial indications of hostile 
fire, and the status of the crew was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time an Apache helicopter has crashed during a  
training mission in Albania. The first copter crashed April 26 as 
NATO prepared to put the U.S. attack helicopters into action 
against Serb forces in Kosovo. Its crewmen escaped with cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic on Tuesday praised top army commanders for defying  
NATO, ``the biggest aggressor in the world.'' The Yugoslav leader 
met with several top army commanders on Tuesday, praising them for 
defying NATO and saying the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army had been 
``fully defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's declaration that the KLA has been defeated was  
disputed by a senior rebel commander, Ramush Haradinaj, who told 
The Associated Press in Vienna, Austria, that intense fighting was 
raging in northern and eastern Kosovo and along the Albanian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports could not be confirmed because most foreign  
journalists have been ordered out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read on state television, Milosevic said ``the  
next task'' of his security forces is ``the persistent defense'' of 
Yugoslavia from NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO jets struck early Wednesday near Uzice, 50 miles south of  
Belgrade. The state-run Tanjug news agency reported strong 
explosions northwest of the city but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Clinton headed to alliance headquarters in  
Brussels, Belgium, before traveling to Germany to meet with U.S. 
troops and some of the 675,000 refugees forced out of Kosovo since 
the NATO airstrikes began on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict continued, with Russian  
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan for the second time in a week. However, no diplomatic 
solution appeared imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	British defense officials said more than 50 targets were hit  
over the previous 24 hours in relentless attacks focusing on 
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, including strikes against tanks, 
artillery and military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Briefing reporters in Brussels, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz said  
NATO's operations over the past day were the most successful to 
date against field forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said an allied aircraft intercepted and shot down a  
Yugoslav aircraft 13,000 feet over Serbia. Pentagon officials said 
a U.S. Air Force F-16 shot down the MiG in aerial combat near the 
Bosnian-Serb border. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said its planes also bombed a MiG-29 parked at an airfield.  
</P>
<P>
	While Yugoslav aircraft have been struck on the ground at  
various Serbian and Montenegrin airports -- even seen hiding under 
the tails of large commercial airplanes -- the Yugoslav air force 
has avoided confrontations with NATO warplanes for much of the air 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of the conflict -- March 26 -- American F-15C  
jets shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29s after they entered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	After striking a military airfield and destroying a TV station  
overnight, NATO jets on Tuesday also reportedly made their first 
daytime strike on a factory in central Serbia, the Tanjug news 
agency said. NATO claims ammunition is manufactured at the 
hydraulics complex in Valjevo, largely destroyed in previous 
strikes during the 6-week campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Yugoslav media reported a NATO missile hit a bus,  
killing 20 people in western Kosovo. But NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
said its commanders had checked all gun cameras from planes 
operating in the area and interviewed all pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can find no evidence of any NATO involvement in this  
incident,'' Shea insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's classic ambush country,'' Shea said of the Pec area where  
Serb forces and rebels had had heavy skirmishes, adding that the 
bus did not ``seem to have been hit by a missile or a bomb from an 
aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces were responsible for the attack, the rebel ethnic  
Albanian news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a French-language dispatch by Kosovapress news  
agency, the bus had been transporting Serb forces and was abandoned 
at least two hours before NATO launched airstrikes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia after Milosevic  
rejected a Western plan to end the fighting in Kosovo, an ethnic 
Albanian-majority province in Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, 
that once had 2 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third of Kosovo's population has poured out of  
Kosovo since the airstrikes began -- many expelled by Serb forces 
into neighboring Albania and Macedonia.

at least two hours before NATO launched airstrikes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia after Milosevic  
rejected a Western plan to end the fighting in Kosovo, an ethnic 
Albanian-majority province in Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, 
that once had 2 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third of Kosovo's population has poured out of  
Kosovo since the airstrikes began -- many expelled by Serb forces 
into neighboring Albania and Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Decline; Dow Falls 128.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended sharply lower Tuesday as a runup in  
interest rates prompted investors to reverse a buying spree on 
Monday that sent the Dow industrials above 11,000 for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.58 to 10,886.11.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators gave ground after a mixed morning. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 ended down 22.63 at 1,332.00, while the 
Nasdaq composite index fell 50.46 to 2,485.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's loss in the Dow shaved off more than half of Monday's  
225-point gain to a record 11,014.69, though many traders had 
expected a retreat after the leap from 10,000 past 11,000. Having 
taken just 24 trading days, that advance represented the fastest 
rise ever between 1,000-point milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	But as interest rates continued to rise in the bond market,  
pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 5.71 percent 
from 5.65 percent late Monday, investors became more concerned 
about the possible effect on corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interest rate problem is a problem that can take  
everything down,'' said Robert Robbins, senior vice president and 
market strategist at The Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, when the long bond yield shot up to 5.66 percent  
from Thursday's 5.52 percent, investors dismissed it as a 
``knee-jerk response'' to a report that the nation's economy had 
expanded by a blistering 4.5 percent in the first three months of 
the year, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
	But with rates higher again on Tuesday, ``people get concerned  
about earnings,'' Robbins said. Higher rates would be unwelcome to 
stock investors because they could put downward pressure on 
corporate earnings and, by extension, on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	And because stocks are trading at very expensive levels right  
now, they are vulnerable to anything that can jeopardize earnings, 
Robbins noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields rose after two more reports Tuesday reinforced a  
strong economic outlook. The Conference Board reported that a key 
gauge of future economic activity rose for the sixth straight month 
in March. The research group's index of leading economic indicators 
rose 0.1 percent in March, pushed higher in part by rising stock 
prices. Although the figure was in line with economists' 
predictions, it was worrisome to investors who believe that if the 
economy keeps expanding, interest rates will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second confirmation that the housing market remains robust,  
the Commerce Department reported that completion of privately owned 
housing units rose 12.6 percent in March, the fastest pace since 
April 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures fed fears that the Federal Reserve might be  
inclined to raise interest rates in a bid to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer shares, which often fall when rising interest rates  
push consumer financing costs higher, took the biggest hits among 
blue-chip Dow components. General Motors fell 4 3/4 to 89, after the 
carmaker reported disappointing April sales figures. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble slid 2 1/2 to 91 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks also fell as interest rates rose. American  
Express lost 6 1/4 to 127 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception in the financial services sector was Goldman  
Sachs. The investment bank's shares soared on the Big Board in very 
heavy volume of more than 22 million shares, second only to America 
Online. Goldman shares closed their first day of trading at 70 3/8, up 
17 3/8 from an initial offering price of $53. The investment firm sold 
69 million shares in an initial public offering on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks held firm throughout the morning but buckled  
under selling pressure in the afternoon. Microsoft led the Nasdaq 
components lower, dropping 1 13/16 to 78 1/16. America Online was a 
big loser on the Big Board, shedding 6 to 127 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 1.12 
billion shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 8.08 to 636.10, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.97 to 785.70. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies eased 0.69 to 432.59. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Tokyo bourse was closed for the second  
of three holidays and will resume trading on Thursday. In Europe, 
the FT-SE index in London rose 0.08 percent, the DAX in Frankfurt 
rose 0.11 percent, but the CAC in Paris fell 0.10 percent.

<HEADLINE> NATO: No Evidence Jets Struck Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO has no evidence that allied  
warplanes struck a bus full of women and children in Kosovo, a NATO 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media said 20 people died and 43 were injured in the  
daylight attack Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO commanders made a thorough  
check of all gun cameras from planes operating in the area and 
interviewed all pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can find no evidence of any NATO involvement in this  
incident,'' Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested  
there may have been other causes for the incident. One official 
noted that there had been skirmishes in the area between Yugoslav 
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, describing it as prime 
``ambush country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was attacked on a road 12 miles north of the Kosovo city  
of Pec, said a Montenegrin government official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. Belgrade radio and television stations said 
20 people were killed and 43 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Three civilian and two police cars also were destroyed. NATO's  
target was thought to have been a nearby police and army 
checkpoint, the Montena-fax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said NATO aircraft struck overnight at both Yugoslav  
military and police forces in Kosovo, the southern province of 
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets in Kosovo included armored vehicles, artillery, radar,  
command posts, air defense and troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting those forces off,'' Shea said. He said the  
allies also are pursuing strategic targets outside Kosovo, such as 
communication links, radio relay stations, satellite communications 
and electrical, ammunition and fuel supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO spokesman insisted that Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic must agree to the alliance's five conditions before the 
bombing will stop, including an end to Yugoslav military action in 
Kosovo, withdrawal of army and police forces from the province, an 
international military presence, the unconditional return of 
refugees and a willingness to work toward a political solution.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Look at Ways To Control Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wrigley Field's faithful fans could face more  
stringent security and tighter alcohol access after those angry 
about an umpire's call pelted the field with baseballs, bottles, 
coins and cups of beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-five people were ejected from the bleachers Monday  
night, but there were no arrests following the eighth-inning deluge 
of debris that caused a five-minute delay so crews could clean up 
the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado center fielder Darryl Hamilton said one fan threw a  
Jack Daniels bottle onto the field. The players' safety was an 
obvious concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a game,'' Hamilton said. ``I don't know why people  
get so upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley, surrounded by blocks of bars and restaurants, has long  
been known for its Bleacher Bums, some of whom turn the games into 
nine-inning parties where beer flows freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcohol is certainly a variable to it,'' Mark McGuire, the  
Cubs executive vice president of business operations, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over an 81-game schedule, I don't think you can come to the  
conclusion that it's every game or every night game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reviewing all our options,'' McGuire said. Those include  
adding personnel, relocating security, considering stiffer 
penalties and limiting alcohol sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes could be in place when the Cubs begin their next  
homestand May 14 against Atlanta. The problem Monday night was that 
those littering the field were letting loose from all over the 
stadium, not just the bleachers. Debris could be seen coming from 
the upper decks onto the heads of fans sitting in the lower 
grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began when Chicago manager Jim Riggleman came out  
to argue a call by Jerry Crawford, who ruled that Colorado second 
baseman Mike Lansing had control of a throw before he dropped it. 
Replays showed otherwise, that Lansing never caught the ball and a 
sliding Mark Grace should have been safe. Some fans then erupted 
into a litter-tossing rage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs play only 18 night home games this season; alcohol  
sales are curtailed after the seventh inning or by 9:20 p.m. during 
night games and after the eighth inning of day games. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no beer sales by vendors in the bleachers, and McGuire  
said when there is a marketing souvenir giveaway, the items are 
handed out to bleacher fans as they leave the park, instead of 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing Wrigley tradition is for a fan who catches a  
home run by an opposing batter to throw the ball back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs don't want the debris tossing to become commonplace, as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's becoming part of the tradition and culture  
at Wrigley Field, and it's one we'd like to lose,'' McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman, talking with reporters, offered an apology to Rockies  
manager Jim Leyland and his team after Monday's game, won by 
Colorado 6-1. Riggleman said the majority of the fans are 
well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real minority of people doing it. They need to  
rethink,'' Riggleman said.

<P>
	ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- The online brokerage ETrade Group Inc.  
plans to add 1,900 to 2,200 employees at its Alpharetta office, 
while expanding its space by 450,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has about 300 employees at its Alpharetta location.  
The expansion will occur over the next 2 1/2 years, said Jerry Dark, a 
vice president with ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's first 700 additional employees are expected between  
January and June 2000. The company also has begun construction on a 
150,000- to 200,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has one building in Alpharetta but envisions a  
corporate campus with four or five buildings housing customer 
service, marketing and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1998 revenues of $245 million, ETrade has more than doubled  
its customer accounts since launching its Destination ETrade Web 
site seven months ago.

<HEADLINE> Congress Revives Disaster Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stalled package of aid for Central American  
disaster victims and U.S. farmers is getting new life on Capitol 
Hill, thanks to the congressional fight over the confrontation with 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central America legislation, dormant but technically in  
conference between the House and Senate, is likely to become the 
vehicle for billions of dollars for the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
Adding the Yugoslavia money to that conference report would speed 
consideration of the defense money and eliminate the possibility of 
amendments, underlining Republican leaders' concerns that 
otherwise, a lengthy, divisive Senate debate over President 
Clinton's Balkans policies would result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have time'' to consider the Yugoslavia  
spending legislation separately, Senate Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters Tuesday. ``The 
Department of Defense is running out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House, which has rules that let it move quickly, plans to  
vote on a $12.9 billion version of the Yugoslavia measure on 
Thursday. That amount is twice what Clinton has requested. 
</P>
<P>
	After House passage, which is considered likely, the Senate  
would never vote on a separate Yugoslavia bill. Negotiations 
between the two chambers over the package's size would begin, with 
the compromise placed into the Central America measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders hope to send Clinton a package late next week that many  
participants expect will include about $9 billion for the 
confrontation over Kosovo, plus aid for Central America and U.S. 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved $1.3 billion for Central America and farmers  
on March 24. The Senate passed a $2.4 billion measure the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials and Democratic lawmakers urged  
GOP leaders to rush a compromise bill to the president so the money 
could move quickly to Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch 
and to American farmers hurt by low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Central America legislation has gone nowhere. It has  
been slowed by disputes between the two chambers, and between 
Congress and Clinton, over GOP proposals to cut other programs to 
pay for the measure and over Senate provisions dealing with tobacco 
settlement money and help for the steel, oil and mining industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, many Republicans have shown little enthusiasm for a  
package dominated by foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Central America measure has been legislatively  
resurrected, Democrats tried pressuring Republicans to move the 
legislation on Tuesday by emphasizing its aid for American farmers. 
The House version has $152 million, the Senate bill $592 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get help out to farmers and ranchers now,'' said  
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who held a news 
conference with rural bankers and a half-dozen Senate Democrats. He 
said that without the aid, ``we could lose 20 to 30 percent of our 
producers in the coming year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said  
they expect language in the Senate's Central America bill to 
survive that would forbid the federal government from sharing any 
of the $246 billion tobacco companies agreed to pay the states to 
settle health-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, that language and the GOP's proposed spending cuts  
have drawn White House warnings that Clinton would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said if acceptable spending cuts were worked out, he  
would urge the president to sign the bill and fight over tobacco 
another day.

<HEADLINE> Opening Statements in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers conspired to violate  
the civil rights of a black Haitian immigrant, with two of them 
turning a police station bathroom into a bloody torture chamber, a 
prosecutor charged this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth Thompson, making his opening  
statement in the highly charged brutality trial, described in 
graphic detail how a handcuffed Abner Louima was battered inside 
the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aug. 9, 1997, beating, which left Louima hospitalized with  
severe internal injuries, drew national attention and prompted 
widespread anti-police brutality demonstrations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inside that bathroom, Abner Louima suffered more than a  
beating,'' Thompson told the jury of seven men and five women. 
``Ladies and gentlemen, Abner Louima was tortured inside that 
bathroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the brutal attack, Officer Justin Volpe allegedly  
rammed a wooden stick into Louima's rectum, tearing up the victim's 
insides, while officer Charles Schwarz allegedly held him down. The 
stick, smeared with blood and feces, was then smashed into Louima's 
mouth, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe sat impassively at the defense table with his four  
co-defendants as Thompson pointed him out as ``the man who violated 
Abner Louima's civil rights and his body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys were expected to begin their opening  
statements later today. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the prosecutor, the officers became enraged because  
they thought that Louima had sucker-punched Volpe during a brawl 
outside a Brooklyn nightclub. The attacker was actually Louima's 
cousin, who was wearing a similar outfit, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ``is not about white vs. black, or about the New York  
City police department,'' Thompson said. ``This trial is about an 
escalation of violence that started on the streets of Brooklyn and 
ended on the floor of the 70th Precinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson gave preliminary  
instructions to the anonymous jury -- made up of eight whites, three 
Hispanics and one black -- this morning before opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27; Schwarz, 33; and fellow officers Thomas Bruder, 33,  
and Thomas Wiese, 35, are charged with violating Louima's civil 
rights. The four allegedly beat him after his arrest outside the 
nightclub before the second incident in the bathroom in which only 
Volpe and Schwarz are charged. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth officer, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, is charged with  
helping cover up the attacks. If convicted, Bellomo, Bruder and 
Wiese face up to 10 years in prison. Volpe and Schwarz could 
receive a maximum of life in prison without parole because of the 
sexual nature of the alleged bathroom attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, who has recovered from his injuries and is expected to  
be the government's star witness, has alleged in a 
multimillion-dollar civil suit that police used racial slurs during 
the assault. But in picking a jury, the judge repeatedly reminded 
prospective jurors that the federal indictments against the 
officers made no mention of race. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't been accused of racism at all,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Stephen Worth signaled Monday that he plans to  
attack Louima's credibility by arguing that his story was 
influenced by the controversial activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, who 
rushed to his hospital bedside, and famed defense attorney Johnnie 
Cochran Jr., who is representing him in the civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Worth told the judge he wanted to note in opening arguments that  
Cochran was present when prosecutors took Louima into the courtroom 
one Saturday for coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge ruled that Worth could not mention Sharpton and  
Cochran or that his courtroom was used to prepare a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had known about it, it wouldn't have been held here,''  
the judge said.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Times Steps Up Online Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As part of an effort to beef up its online  
operations, The New York Times is planning to offer speedier 
updates to its own stories on its Web site, the newspaper's 
publisher said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., in a speech at an online media  
conference in San Francisco, said the newspaper also plans other 
steps to make its already successful site more current and useful. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this spirit of constant renewal, our Web site is now  
updated every 10 minutes throughout the day,'' Sulzberger said. 
``We now have a plan in the newsroom to begin offering continuous 
news from The New York Times on important stories throughout the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sulzberger also said that since opening its site free of charge  
to overseas users last July, it has added an average of 4,500 new 
international users each day, for a total of 1 million foreign 
users. The Web site now has an overall total of 7 million 
registered users, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to dire predictions about the future of newspapers  
from tech gurus like Intel Corp. chairman Andy Grove, Sulzberger 
said newspapers would play in important role in helping Internet 
users filter out noise when searching for useful information. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will continue to need a trustworthy guide through all  
the raw data dumps that are proliferating on the Web,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newspapers -- either in print or electronic -- and their  
journalists will always be needed to make discreet, intelligent 
judgments about what is truthful, what is factual, what is relevant 
and what is trustworthy. This is what a newspaper does and what it 
will always do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sought Steele Affidavit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- One of President Clinton's private  
lawyers clashed with Kenneth Starr's prosecutors Tuesday, saying he 
asked a Virginia woman to sign an affidavit helpful to the 
president but exerted ``no pressure'' on her. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, is on trial, accused of  
obstructing Starr's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Ettinger interviewed Ms. Steele in January 1998 -- soon  
after accounts of the Monica Lewinsky affair became public -- and 
then asked her to sign a document undercutting the story of 
Kathleen Willey, who had accused the president of making an 
unwelcome sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had denied Mrs. Willey's account in a deposition.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey, who told her story in a national TV interview last  
year, was in the federal courthouse waiting to testify as Ettinger 
took the stand on the trial's second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, of Richmond is charged with lying to FBI agents and  
Starr's grand juries about Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger insisted that he exerted ``no pressure'' to persuade a  
reluctant Ms. Steele to turn in a signed version of what she had 
told him: that Mrs. Willey had urged her to lie to a magazine 
reporter to support Mrs. Willey's story of a sexual advance in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit was Ms. Steele's first sworn statement on the  
matter. She had previously given two conflicting accounts to the 
Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbally sparring with the president's lawyer, prosecutor David  
Barger suggested that Ms. Steele's affidavit was an important 
document that Clinton could have used to his advantage in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, which the president eventually 
settled for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger said ``I don't know of anyone'' at the law firm  
representing the president who tried to persuade Ms. Steele to sign 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque,  
suggested that Ms. Steele went forward with the affidavit after a 
few weeks of hesitation simply because she wanted to set the record 
straight. Ms. Steele signed the document around the time she 
switched attorneys, hiring Luque. 
</P>
<P>
	Barger raised the possibility that the president's lawyers might  
have arranged for Luque to replace Ms. Steele's Richmond, Va., 
attorneys. Ettinger said he knew nothing about that. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said in her affidavit that she first heard of an  
alleged sexual advance by Clinton in 1997 when Mrs. Willey tried to 
get her to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	But friends of Ms. Steele's called as witnesses have testified  
that Ms. Steele told them about the alleged incident between Mrs. 
Willey and Clinton prior to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey has said she told Ms. Steele about the incident just  
hours after it happened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele has said she told her false story to Newsweek  
reporter Michael Isikoff in 1997 as a favor for her friend but soon 
recanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have argued that Ms. Steele lied to ally herself  
with the president, as well as to make pictures of Mrs. Willey and 
the president that she was selling more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Starr investigated Mrs. Willey's allegation against the  
president, the independent counsel decided not to include the 
matter in his report about the president's relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky, which led to a Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is the only person indicted by Starr's office in  
connection with the sex-and-lies investigation.

<HEADLINE> Dioxin Exposure Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chemical workers exposed to high levels of  
dioxin have a 60 percent increased chance of dying of cancer, but 
the chemical poses no added cancer risk to the general population, 
a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Steenland, co-author of the study appearing Wednesday in  
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, said the research 
suggests most people typically are not currently exposed to 
dangerous levels of dioxin and that cancer appears to result only 
among those who had extremely high and long-term exposures to the 
chemical 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a significant increase in cancers until you get  
to the upper'' exposure levels, Steenland said Tuesday in a 
telephone interview. ``This is not raising a red flag by saying 
that low level exposure is causing a lot of cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the finding ``reassuring'' from a public health stand  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland, a researcher with the National Institute for  
Occupational Safety and Health, said that the amount of dioxin in 
the environment is steadily declining because the products most 
commonly linked to the chemical are no longer being made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin was a byproduct in the manufacture of herbicides and  
pesticides that were in common use decades ago. Production of the 
chemicals halted in the mid 1980s, and the environmental 
contamination has dropped steadily since. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for those who experienced high exposures, the chemical  
can persist in the body for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is one of the chemicals in Agent Orange, the herbicide  
used by the United States to kill jungle vegetation during the 
Vietnam War. Hundreds of American troops were exposed to the 
chemical, but not at the high levels experienced by many chemical 
plant workers, said Steenland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert N. Hoover, of the National Cancer Institute, said  
that the study by Steenland and his colleagues is ``a critical 
piece of evidence'' that shows dioxin, at its present levels in the 
environment, appears to present no significant threat to general 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news from this study is the evidence that dioxin at  
high exposures is a'' cancer-causing chemical, said Hoover. ``The 
good news is that the low levels of exposure (now in the 
environment) are not likely to contribute much disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Steenland examined the health record of some 3,500  
chemical workers who were exposed to dioxin on the job during the 
1960s, '70s and '80s for periods of six months to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among workers with the highest exposure rate there was a 60  
percent increase in cancer deaths when compared to the rate of 
cancer deaths among the general public. This increase, said 
Steenland, was seen only in those workers whose dioxin exposure was 
100 to 1,000 times higher than the background exposure of the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said that dioxin seemed to cause all types of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	``The cancer elevation is not in some specific organ,'' he said.  
``We saw it in respiratory tract cancers and in digestive tract 
cancer. It was across the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said the public health threat of dioxin is declining  
because nobody is regularly exposed to the high levels that once 
were common among chemical plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dioxin is not being added to the environment at anywhere near  
the rate it once was,'' he said. ``It is still produced by 
incinerators when they burn plastics, but it is becoming less and 
less.''

<HEADLINE> Nortel Has New Fiber Optics Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nortel Networks Corp. has developed a new  
product that would advance the capacity of fiber optics 
communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company planned to announce the new product today, according  
to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brampton, Ontario-based Nortel, like its rivals -- including  
Lucent Technologies Inc. -- is racing to develop advanced 
communications technologies needed to meet rapidly increasing 
global demand for Internet data. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nortel's product still must make successful transitions from  
the laboratory to field trials to the marketplace, which could take 
a year. Nortel hopes to announce a communications carrier to try 
the new system within a few weeks and to begin trials in the fourth 
quarter, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The new family of fiber optic technologies is called wave  
division multiplexing, which transmit multiple wavelengths of 
light, or colors, over a single optical fiber. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave-division-multiplexing unit could lift the capacity of a  
network over a traditional single-wavelength system. The new Nortel 
product uses 160 channels, and each channel can transmit 10 billion 
bits of information a second. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel's most advanced unit now only offers 32 channels.  
</P>
<P>
	Lucent aims to announce a product similar to the new Nortel unit  
in about a month, the Times said, quoting executives close to that 
plan.

<HEADLINE>  Tornado Leaves Areas in Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The sun was shining and the wind was  
picking up Tuesday over Lake Shore Mobile Home Park, where a small, 
manmade lake was brimming with the remnants of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	A mobile home floated upside down in the nameless lake. Wreckage  
drifted past. Clothing hung on trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Rohlman picked up clothing near his trailer, which had  
been squashed by the roof of his neighbor's home. He had gone to a 
bookstore a few minutes before a tornado hit Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gone there I might not be around,'' he said.  
``Boy, a lot of that stuff is buried. What a mess. I'm going to 
have to dig it out piece by piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado did serious damage in Kansas, killing five people  
and injuring 100 others. Two of those killed were from the trailer 
park. The other three were from Haysville and included a 
one-month-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Spawned by the same storm system Monday that produced even  
deadlier tornadoes across the state line in Oklahoma, the Kansas 
tornado cut a path 12 miles long and 3 miles wide in southern 
Wichita and suburban Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 8,000 buildings were damaged. Of those, more than  
1,100 were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' Eric Peterson, a recent transplant from  
Seattle, said of the ruin that included a tree thrown into his 
bedroom in Haysville, just south of Wichita. ``I have been in 
typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, but this tops 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard troops joined about 200 state and local police in  
the area and dogs were used to search the wreckage for possible 
additional victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and his wife, Julie, grabbed their 5-year-old son  
before the twister struck and ran to a shelter. Their one-story 
rented home was still standing, despite a damaged roof. Their boy's 
wooden swing set had been picked up and hurled into a yard four 
houses away. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 150 houses, 27 businesses and three churches were  
damaged or destroyed in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people -- two customers and 11 employees -- were inside  
Leeker's, a Haysville grocery store, Monday night when assistant 
manager Pat Leeker received a call from his wife, who warned him 
that a tornado was expected to strike any minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeker locked the front door to keep anyone else from entering,  
then all 13 headed into the 18-by-25 foot produce cooler. They were 
on the floor, hands covering their heads, when the tornado roared 
over about five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happened so quick,'' Leeker said. The group emerged to  
find tiles fallen from the ceiling and water sloshing on the floor 
-- but no damage to the store's windows. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the lake, Misty and David Seeber walked along a shore  
with trees stripped bare, picking through the pile of broken wood 
and twisted metal that used to be their home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her 22nd birthday on Tuesday. The couple found some  
wedding pictures and her wedding dress and were looking for David's 
wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find his wedding ring, we'll be happy,'' she said.  
``We're very lucky somebody's watching over us.''

<HEADLINE> Tampa's Saunders Demoted to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Less than two weeks after nearly  
throwing a no-hitter, Tampa Bay's Tony Saunders is headed to the 
minor leagues to try to get his career back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays demoted the left-hander to Triple-A Tuesday in  
hopes he can regain the confidence necessary to be successful in 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Tony, it's not one or two starts down there. He is going  
to have to pitch a little bit and get his feet back on the 
ground,'' manager Larry Rothschild said. ``There's no guarantees. 
We all hope he gets it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders held the Baltimore Orioles hitless for 7 2-3 innings on  
April 22, losing his bid for a no-hitter when Mike Bordick singled 
with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old left-hander was far from flawless, though,  
walking seven and hitting a batter. But what concerned the Devil 
Rays more was his performance in two subsequent starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders allowed 14 earned runs, 16 hits and walked five in 7  
1-3 innings in those outings, slipping to 2-3 with an 8.67 ERA in 
six starts overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Eddie Gaillard was recalled from Durham to replace  
Saunders. Right-hander Esteban Yan (1-0, 3.31 ERA) will move from 
the bullpen into the rotation with his first start scheduled for 
Saturday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a step backward to hopefully take two steps  
forward ... We still think he's got a chance to be a big part of 
this organization,'' Rothschild said of Saunders, the first pick in 
the 1997 expansion draft from the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody looks at it as a major setback -- and it could be,''  
the manager added. ``But it could be a bump in the road in becoming 
the pitcher that he should at the major league level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yan moving from the means three of Tampa Bay's five starters  
have less than two years of major league experience. Yan and 
Rolando Arrojo are in their second season, while rookie Ryan Rupe 
was promoted from Double-A Orlando on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Satellite Launch Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A military communication satellite  
was stuck in an orbit thousands of miles too low today following 
the third failed mission in a row for the Air Force's premier 
rocket. The fiascoes have cost taxpayers $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have three failures in a row of any system ...  
something is not right,'' said Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who is in 
charge of Cape Canaveral Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	The $800 million Milstar satellite never made it to its intended  
22,300-mile-high perch Friday. Instead, it circled Earth in a 
lonely, lopsided orbit that reached no more than 3,100 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said they're not sure what went wrong. The  
preliminary indication was that the Titan IV rocket did its job 
during the first several minutes of the launch, but that the upper 
stage needed to propel the satellite higher did not fire properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, we do not know and we're not going to  
speculate,'' Starbuck said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force controllers will try to boost the satellite using  
on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	A different type of upper-stage motor malfunctioned three weeks  
ago, leaving a missile-warning satellite in a useless orbit 
following its launch aboard a Titan IV. And last August, a Titan IV 
rocket and the spy satellite on board were destroyed in a midair 
explosion less than a minute into the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbuck said there appears to be no similarities among the  
three failures. ``But we will continue to look for those and if 
there is one, we'll find that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force will not launch any rockets until the problem is  
understood, Starbuck said. Boeing already has delayed the launch of 
its new Delta III rocket from Sunday to Tuesday -- or possibly later 
-- so engineers can make sure there are no links with the latest 
Titan IV trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been decades since the same kind of rocket failed three  
times in a row. The Titan IV, the nation's most powerful unmanned 
rocket, has been flying since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department's newest Milstar satellite was to have  
joined two less sophisticated Milstars already in orbit. In all, 
the Air Force planned six such satellites to provide secure, 
jam-proof communication between U.S. military commanders and troops 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials stressed that Friday's mishap will not  
hamper military communication or national security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstar program was criticized by the General Accounting  
Office last fall as outdated and inefficient. The satellites were 
conceived during the Cold War and designed to withstand the 
radiation from a nuclear blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Corp. built the satellite as well as the Titan  
IV rocket.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 120.58  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended considerably lower today, as a  
runup in interest rates prompted investors to reverse yesterday's 
buying spree that sent the Dow industrials above 11,000 for the 
first time. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 120.58 at 
10,886.11 today. Broader stock indicators gave ground after a mixed 
morning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 22.63 to 1,332, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 50.45 to 2,485.13. 
Today's loss in the Dow was more than half of Monday's 225-point 
gain to 11,014.69. As interest rates continued to rise in the bond 
market, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 5.72 
percent from 5.65 percent late Monday, investors became more 
concerned about the effect that could have on corporate earnings.

customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet. 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said today that an SEC review of online brokerage account 
agreements found that ``almost none'' of them discuss trading risks 
or what customers should do if there is a computer system outage.

	Kodak CFO Harry Kavetas Dies  
</P>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. chief financial officer  
Harry L. Kavetas, who helped engineer nearly 20,000 job cuts at the 
photography company to counter Japanese gains in the U.S. market, 
died today at age 61. Kavetas suffered an apparent heart attack at 
his home. A longtime executive at IBM Corp., Kavetas took a brief 
early retirement at the end of 1993 after being passed over for a 
top post by new IBM chief executive Louis V. Gerstner. He was hired 
as Kodak's chief financial officer in February 1994. By the end of 
this year, Kodak expects to trim more than $1 billion in costs by 
eliminating almost one-fifth of its worldwide payroll of 100,500. 
The company has seen a sharp rebound in sales and profits in recent 
months.

	PARIS (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. has signed a $758 million deal to  
acquire the soft drink brand Orangina from French beverage company 
Pernod Ricard -- an acquisition blocked by France for nearly 18 
months. The companies announced that the new agreement is intended 
to respond to the concerns of French competition authorities by 
excluding Coca-Cola from distributing Orangina in French 
restaurants, bars and hotels for 10 years. The restriction does not 
apply to Coke's rights to sell Orangina in other countries.

	Clinton Proposes Privacy Controls

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed legislation  
to protect consumers against information-sharing among banks, 
insurance companies and security firms. Clinton noted that 
consumers receive 4 billion unsolicited credit card offers every 
year and that some people are duped by the small print. The 
legislation would require financial institutions to inform 
consumers of plans to share or sell their personal financial 
information and give consumers the power to stop such a transfer. 
Credit-card offers would be required to prominently disclose when 
their low ``teaser rates'' expire. Also today, Clinton reiterated 
his support for the Community Reinvestment Act, which spurs banks 
to lend in underdeveloped communities.

of its 1999 Expeditions and Navigators because of a problem that 
could cause the wheels to fall off. The recall of the two sport 
utility vehicles affects models with optional 17-inch 
chrome-finished steel wheels. Ford said some wheels might not have

each Chock full o'Nuts share, $1,275.82 for bonds due in 2012 and 
$1,344.43 for bonds due in 2006. The maker of Ball Park hot dogs,

shares outstanding and a repeal of formidable takeover defenses 
initiated by the board of Chock full o'Nuts.

<HEADLINE> Japan Predicts Economic Turnaround </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is  
telling President Clinton what he wants to hear -- that the world's 
second largest economy is poised to make a ``major turnaround'' 
that will provide relief for a troubled global economy and the 
soaring U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the United States and Japan announced a flurry of  
trade deals during Obuchi's meetings Monday with Clinton, the 
president and others in his administration pointedly warned that 
Japan must address a host of other irritants, including, most 
importantly, rising steel shipments to the United states. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of cheap steel from Japan and other countries has  
resulted in thousands of layoffs in the American industry, raising 
a protectionist clamor in Congress as America's trade deficit hit a 
record $169 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over the widening U.S. deficit with Japan, which  
climbed to a near-record $64 billion last year, were raised by 
members of Congress today in meetings with Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called Obuchi's  
visit to America ``very timely'' because of the number of issues 
that need to be addressed in the relationship between the world's 
two largest economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the discussions with Senate leaders covered ``a number  
of issues from economics to trade to security.'' He singled out 
Japan's $200 million in economic support to deal with the Kosovo 
refugee situation for praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Congress was appreciative of Japan's support in the  
effort ``to bring a peaceful solution and to address the 
humanitarian needs of the Kosovars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's rising trade deficit has battered American  
manufacturers in steel and other industries, who have seen their 
overseas markets shrink because of spreading recessions in other 
nations, and have had to compete against rising imports pouring 
into the United States, the only major economy doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has already passed a bill that would impose global  
quotas on steel imports even though the administration has said the 
measure is clearly in violation of U.S. commitments to the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	While steel shipments from Japan are running below last year's  
levels, Clinton said he impressed on Obuchi the need to make sure 
they remain low. The administration has been pushing Japan to boost 
its own economy to help lift its Asian neighbors out of recession 
and take pressure off the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	On that score, Obuchi brought an optimistic forecast, saying  
massive amounts of government spending and serious efforts to deal 
with Japan's banking crisis should soon begin to bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I explained to the president that Japan is swiftly and boldly  
taking every measure in order to address the difficulties we are 
facing,'' Obuchi said at a joint news conference with Clinton on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi predicted his government's effort would result in a  
``major turnaround'' that will pull Japan out of its worst 
recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obuchi both welcomed a new package of trade  
agreements announced Monday that are designed to boost American 
exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan pledged to take a series of actions, including reducing  
hookup charges for foreign telephone companies seeking to crack 
Japan's vast telecommunications market, revising regulations that 
have prohibited sale of American lumber for homes and apartments 
and shortening the approval time for new drugs offered by U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	These measures were follow-ups to an initial package announced  
by the two countries at last year's Group of Seven economic summit 
in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to measures benefiting specific industries, the  
administration struck deals it said would expand opportunities for 
American businesses to make foreign investments in Japan and 
strengthen Japan's antitrust enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of what one U.S. official called a ``sea change'' in  
Japan's approach to economic issues, the administration pointed to 
a column Obuchi wrote last week in The New York Times in which he 
said, ``Unless we adopt a more flexible economy driven by the 
market, Japan is doomed to economic and technological decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But private analysts said the structural problems Japan is  
facing are so severe that it is far from clear that Japan is 
willing to go far enough in changing its society. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese economy is so over-regulated and structurally  
distorted that the normal economic tools don't work,'' said Clyde 
Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington 
think tank devoted to trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi offered Clinton support on the administration's efforts  
to deal with the Kosovo crisis and pledged $200 million in 
financial aid to help affected nations in the region. The two 
leaders also pledged continued cooperation in dealing with nuclear 
and missile threats posed by North Korea.

<HEADLINE>  Protests at Cuba, Orioles Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A boisterous crowd of Cuban-Americans protested  
Monday's game between the Cuban national team and the Baltimore 
Orioles, both in the streets and on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	One anti-Castro demonstrator carrying a sign that said,  
``Freedom -- Strike Out Against Castro,'' ran onto the field in the 
middle of the game and was wrestled to the ground by a Cuban 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	As another protester who ran onto the field was led, shouting,  
past the Cuban dugout and the Cuban delegation, the Cubans booed 
and gave him the thumbs-down sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rolando Suarez Cobian, director of Caritas Cubana, a Roman  
Catholic relief agency, said the Cuban delegation was not insulted 
by the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are merely slowing the game down,'' he said. ``This is a  
joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-Americans considered the game, which the Cuban team won  
12-6, a diversion from Fidel Castro's brutal dictatorship in the 
communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, some of whom had spent 18 hours on buses from Miami,  
met first at a statue of 19th century Cuban independence hero Jose 
Marti before gathering across the street from the main entrance to 
Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The noisy crowd of chanting demonstrators was separated from the  
stadium by two rows of officers and mounted police. Police 
estimates put the number of protesters at 300, far less than the 
1,500 anticipated. No protesters were arrested outside the stadium, 
according to a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the stadium, three men from Miami, who ran onto the  
field, were given criminal citations for misdemeanor trespassing. 
If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of three months in jail 
and a $500 fine. A 13-year-old boy, the son of one of the men, also 
ran onto the field and was detained, but not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the men as: Diego Tintorero, 42; Pablo Capote,  
67; and Carlos Dolz, 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria E. Cosculluela, a member of Miami-based Mothers against  
Repression for Cuba, said she wouldn't support either team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are rooting for the Cuban people, the dissidents, the  
people in jail,'' she said. ``We are for the Cuban people and this 
game should never have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters wore T-shirts with messages like ``Fidel murderer''  
and ``Justice and human rights now! Baseball later,'' and held 
signs that read ``La Represion en Cuba no es cosa de juego'' (The 
repression in Cuba is not a game). They held a moment of silence 
for those martyred in the fight against the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses ferried protesters from New York, New Jersey, Washington,  
D.C., and Florida. Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., helped organize some 
of the bus trips and attended the rally along with Rep. Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Fernandez, a banker from Newark, N.J., said the decision to  
allow Cuba to play a major league club in the United States for the 
first time was hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to tell the government in Kosovo that we want  
human rights but 90 miles from (Miami) we allow repression to 
continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 37, and his family were allowed to leave Cuba and  
join relatives in the United States in 1976 only after his father 
agreed to cut sugar cane for five years in a government labor camp 
in exchange for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	About one block away from the anti-Castro protesters, a smaller  
group called for an end to the longstanding trade embargo against 
the Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the effect of the blockade on the Cuban  
people,'' said Jeff Bigelow of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has Cuba done to the U.S. to deserve this punishment for  
40 years?'' said a Miami man, who declined to give his name fearing 
retribution from anti-Castro forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Orioles became the first major league team to play  
in Cuba in 40 years. They beat Cuba 3-2 in 11 innings, but have 
been struggling in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said his goal is to improve  
relations through people-to-people contact between the two 
countries, which have been divided by a longstanding U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,  
``Regardless of the outcome, the Cuban people will win when they 
have a window to the outside world, even if it is only through the 
televised version of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers against Repression for Cuba,  
said the game only fostered ``people-to-tyrant contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This baseball game hides the desire of many commercial  
enterprises that want to do business with Cuba's bloody dictator,'' 
she said.

	About one block away from the anti-Castro protesters, a smaller  
group called for an end to the longstanding trade embargo against 
the Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the effect of the blockade on the Cuban  
people,'' said Jeff Bigelow of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has Cuba done to the U.S. to deserve this punishment for  
40 years?'' said a Miami man, who declined to give his name fearing 
retribution from anti-Castro forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Orioles became the first major league team to play  
in Cuba in 40 years. They beat Cuba 3-2 in 11 innings, but have 
been struggling in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said his goal is to improve  
relations through people-to-people contact between the two 
countries, which have been divided by a longstanding U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,  
``Regardless of the outcome, the Cuban people will win when they 
have a window to the outside world, even if it is only through the 
televised version of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers against Repression for Cuba,  
said the game only fostered ``people-to-tyrant contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This baseball game hides the desire of many commercial  
enterprises that want to do business with Cuba's bloody dictator,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Spectator Deaths Tragic but Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The deaths of three spectators at Michigan  
last year and three others at Charlotte last week attest to the 
dangers of auto racing. Constant improvements in safety, however, 
have made such tragic incidents rare at major U.S. tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we make every effort to minimize risk, we cannot remove  
all risk, either to spectators or to participants,'' an 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three fans at Michigan Speedway died when a tire and other  
debris hurtled into the crowd after a crash in the Championship 
Auto Racing Teams U.S. 500 last July. On Saturday, three spectators 
were killed and eight were injured when crash debris flew into the 
stands during the Indy Racing League's VisionAire 500 at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch fences shielding spectators at both tracks were 15  
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fences do a very good job in keeping most debris on the  
track,'' IMS vice president Fred Nation said. ``It does happen 
every once in a while on a short track. But it's rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spectator fatalities certainly are rarer today than in the  
past, especially considering the dramatic increase in the numbers 
of people attending races and the number of events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spectator fatalities at Charlotte were the first at an IRL  
race and the first for the track, which opened in 1960. The last 
race-related death of a spectator at a major U.S. track before last 
year was at Indianapolis in 1987, when a tire bounced over the 
fence and into the grandstand after a crash, killing a man. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, as part of a track reconstruction in preparation for  
the first NASCAR Brickyard 400 the next year, the fencing at Indy 
was raised a little more than 4 feet to 19 feet, 8 inches most of 
the way around the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Horizontal cables running along the wall also were installed to  
help prevent cars crashing into the stands. The Speedway also built 
a 6-foot overhang at a 45-degree angle atop the fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for that is that cars tend to have incidents  
against the outside walls, and debris goes up as well as out,'' 
Nation said. ``We believe this fencing, the height and overhang, is 
appropriate for the contours of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, 
but that every track is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tracks that have a different configuration are not necessarily  
unsafe. Each has to be looked at, considering the conditions, the 
banking, the length, the speed attained on those tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash at Charlotte is still being investigated.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to gather the material that will allow the league  
officials and the speedway to recreate the accident if possible and 
try to learn from that,'' IRL spokesman Ron Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch fence where the accident occurred at Charlotte, near  
the exit of the fourth turn, is topped with a 35-inch overhang. The 
track spent more than $1 million on various safety improvements, 
including raising the height of the fence 2 feet before its first 
IRL race in 1997, and officials are looking into raising the fence 
again, as well as extending the overhang. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indianapolis, more changes to protect drivers and spectators  
already are under way as part of a track renovation for its first 
U.S. Grand Prix Formula One race next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In turns two and four we are constructing full concrete walls  
and debris fencing extending up 17 1/4 feet (in the infield),'' Nation 
said. ``They replace some metal barriers and smaller fences that 
were there before. ... Over the years, we have continually upgraded 
the infield side, even though that's a much lower risk area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new fencing will be completed in time for the Indianapolis  
500 on May 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the CART race last year, recent spectator deaths in the  
United States -- all on short tracks or on drag strips -- included 
one at the Green Hill (N.C.) Motor Speedway in 1997, when the 
driver suffered a heart attack and crashed into the stands; and at 
an NHRA drag race at Warrenton, Va., in 1996, when a woman sitting 
in the grandstand was struck and killed and her son critically 
injured by an out-of-control dragster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a spectator was killed and another slightly injured  
when a tire flew off a race car at Duck River Speedway in 
Nashville, Tenn.; a spectator was struck and killed by a tire that 
cleared a safety fence at a stock car race at Unity, Maine; and 
three people were killed when a dragster jumped a guardrail and 
plowed into the crowd in Cumberland, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine spectators have been killed in the 90-year history of the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and two of those occurred when a 
homemade scaffolding collapsed in the infield in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week after the Michigan deaths last year, two  
spectators received minor injuries when they were hit by small 
pieces of fiberglass that cleared the catch fence after a multi-car 
crash during an IROC race at Indianapolis. In the same incident, 
two-time Indy winner Arie Luyendyk suffered a mild concussion when 
his car slammed against the inside wall at an area covered by a new 
shock-absorbing material. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on an improved version of that,'' Nation said.  
``It also impacts spectator safety, because the more impact 
absorbed by the wall, the less likely there will be debris to fly 
around and possibly into stands.''

<HEADLINE> Case From Starr Probe Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A witness who helped Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton says that around 
the time she gave grand jury testimony she was contacted repeatedly 
by a Virginia woman on trial for obstructing Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Highsmith testified Monday that she got numerous phone  
calls from Julie Hiatt Steele, her former best friend, last summer 
as Mrs. Highsmith gave Starr's investigators information that 
contradicted Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie wanted to know if I had testified. ... She wanted to  
know what the grand jury wanted to know. ... I wanted to avoid that 
conversation,'' but ended up telling her, Mrs. Highsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	While giving damaging testimony on the opening day of Ms.  
Steele's trial, Mrs. Highsmith admitted on cross-examination that 
she twice changed her story on a crucial point involving Ms. 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	The case accusing Ms. Steele, 52, of obstruction of justice and  
lying to the FBI revolves around when she was told by presidential 
accuser Kathleen Willey about an alleged unwanted sexual advance by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, whose testimony before the independent counsel's  
grand jury has been helpful to the president, says Mrs. Willey 
first told her about the purported encounter with Clinton in 1997 
and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. Mrs. Willey 
says she confided the alleged Clinton advance to Ms. Steele in 1993 
hours after it occurred. The discrepancy is one factor that made it 
impossible for Starr to send an impeachment referral on the Willey 
matter to the House last year along with his referral on the Monica 
Lewnisky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey was expected to take the stand this week, but U.S.  
District Judge Claude Hilton said the trial would not become a 
referendum on what, if anything, really happened between her and 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in a soft voice, Mrs. Highsmith testified to the  
federal court jury that in September 1996, Mrs. Willey related the 
alleged Clinton advance to her and to Ms. Steele over lunch. Mrs. 
Highsmith said she was shocked, but that there was ``not a big 
reaction'' from Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Steele lawyer Eric Dubelier, Mrs. Highsmith  
admitted that she initially told Starr's investigators that the 
first time she ever spoke to Ms. Steele about Mrs. Willey's 
allegation was in January or February of 1998. In that initial FBI 
interview on June 26, 1998, Mrs. Highsmith stated there was no 
discussion at the 1996 luncheon of any alleged sexual advance by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time that was the way I recalled it,'' said Mrs.  
Highsmith. ``That is what I said the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith admitted she called Starr's investigators back  
the next day and said the first time she'd heard of the Willey 
incident was in a November 1997 phone call from Ms. Steele. She 
changed her story again when testifying to Starr's grand jury in 
Alexandria, Va., six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith said Ms. Steele, a neighbor, ``was my best  
friend,'' but that the two women were in touch infrequently after 
Mrs. Highsmith moved from Midlothian, Va., to Longmont, Colo., late 
in 1996. However, they began speaking often when Starr geared up 
his probe of Mrs. Willey's story, which resulted in Mrs. Highsmith 
eventually testifying to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith said she ended up revealing to Ms. Steele that  
the grand jury ``wanted to know about her and Kathleen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one conversation, ``Julie told me she was afraid it was to  
her detriment if she took a position against the president,'' Mrs. 
Highsmith said of the two women's conversations about the Willey 
controversy.

<HEADLINE> WTO Meeting Fails To Appoint Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization broke off attempts  
Tuesday to find a new director-general after virtually ruling out 
Thailand's candidate and failing to agree on his New Zealand rival. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of the 134-nation WTO General Council adjourned after  
its chairman, Ali Mchumo, was unable to rally Asian and developing 
countries around former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, the 
American and European choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock increased the likelihood that a third candidate may  
need to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	It also raised the prospect of a lengthy leadership vacuum which  
may damage efforts to mediate high-profile trade disputes and 
prepare for a November summit in Seattle to lower barriers to 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Renato Ruggiero officially left Friday after four years  
in the post, but stayed at work until Tuesday afternoon. In a final 
statement, he expressed disappointment that no successor had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo, a Tanzanian diplomat told the council that there was no  
prospect of consensus to appoint Supachai Panitchpakdi, the Thai 
deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll last week, 62 countries supported Moore, a former  
trade unionist who was prime minister briefly in 1990. Supachai, 
the front-runner for months and the perceived developing country 
candidate, was backed by 59 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the case that Dr. Supachai and his supporters may  
still believe he is a candidate,'' Mchumo said. ``But in terms of 
the rules of this process he is no longer a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Asian nations stood by their choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any attempt to impose a decision on the WTO membership could  
divide us and as a consequence gravely impair ... the entire 
organization,'' said a statement by Malaysia on behalf of the ASEAN 
group of countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for reflection and responsibility by all as the means  
to restore unity,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies in Latin America and parts of  
Europe insist that the title of director-general now belongs to 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while to form a consensus,'' U.S. delegate Rita  
Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has named David Hartridge, head of its services  
division, as acting director, but only to handle routine matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartridge lacks the international clout needed at a time when  
free trade ideals are under pressure from the global economic 
upheavals.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats Raises Cereal Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. is joining other major cereal  
makers in raising prices, boosting prices of such brands as Cap'n 
Crunch and Life by about 3 percent, or about 8 cents a box. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices increases, which affect about 45 percent of the  
company's product line, will offset higher costs for labor, 
advertising and product improvements, company spokeswoman Margaret 
Eichman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker's announcement comes a month after General Mills Inc.  
said it would raise by 2.5 percent the price of its breakfast 
cereals. In December, Kellogg Co. raised the prices of its 
breakfast cereals by 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Joy, an analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group, said the  
companies are boosting prices to pay for additional advertising as 
they try to stem the recent trend among Americans toward eating 
``on-the-go'' foods instead of cereal for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy also said Quaker's decision to raise prices may be partly  
opportunistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as everybody goes up, it affords them the ability to  
go up as well,'' Joy said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Damage Worries Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While residents combed through debris from the  
tornadoes that ripped through Oklahoma and Kansas Monday, insurance 
companies anticipating drastic losses made their first overtures to 
the battered region. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major insurers were all preparing special  
catastrophe teams to travel to the area. Some claims adjusters 
arrived Tuesday and were beginning to evaluate the damage, but many 
others stayed away for another day, awaiting a lull in the 
wrenching weather. 
</P>
<P>
	While cost estimates of the damage won't be available for  
several days, the size and ferocity of the storms led many to 
believe the losses will be the steepest ever caused by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	The costliest tornado on record struck Xenia, Ohio in 1974,  
causing $400 million in property damage, according to the Property 
Claim Services unit of the New York-based Insurance Services Office 
Inc. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $1.3 billion, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The costliest storm on record was Hurricane Andrew, which caused  
about $16 billion in property losses in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,000 houses in the Oklahoma City area were destroyed  
by the tornadoes. Wichita, Kan., also sustained heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We studied 37 mid-sized to large catastrophes last year,''  
said John Eager, director of claims services for the National 
Association of Independent Insurers. ``I don't remember any that 
were as devastating as this one seems to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many areas remained off-limits to insurance workers Tuesday  
afternoon as rescue workers searched for survivors. Travelers 
Property and Casualty, which plans to have a dozen workers in the 
damaged regions by Wednesday morning, said another 40 would arrive 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first step is to assess the whole area, and then we'll see  
what else we need to do,'' said Ray Stone, catastrophe manager for 
the insurance giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford, a Connecticut-based insurer, had some adjusters at  
work in Oklahoma on Tuesday, but also anticipated a heavier 
workload later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Erwin, a spokesman for the Insurance Information  
Institute, said insurance companies typically wait a bit before 
they fully mobilize after a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are initially in shock,'' he said. ``It's OK to let  
them be in shock for a while, then go in and help them rebuild.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Coach Requests Asylum in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Cuban baseball coach skipped the flight home  
Tuesday after the game against the Baltimore Orioles and asked for 
asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other Cubans who missed the plane are believed to have done  
so accidentally and will be allowed to return home without U.S. 
government interference, Justice Department officials said Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberto Herrera, a 54-year-old pitching coach, walked into the  
downtown police headquarters about 10 a.m. Tuesday, a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lieutenant on duty ``through an interpreter, understood he  
was requesting asylum and immediately notified INS officials,'' 
said spokesman Robert Weinhold. The Immigration and Naturalization 
Service took custody of Herrera, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a foe of Fidel Castro's regime, said  
the man's full name is Rigoberto Herrera Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said two other Cubans may also have asked for asylum  
but the Justice Department officials, asking not to be identified, 
said they were unaware of any such request. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Cuban government list of the delegation that  
traveled to Baltimore included Rigoberto Betancourt. The government 
news agency said he was a 54-year-old retired pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He played Cuban baseball between 1965 and 1975 and was known for  
an excellent curveball. Three times he was part of the national 
team -- during the Central American-Caribbean games in Puerto Rico 
in 1966, in the Pan American games in Winnipeg in 1967 and during a 
tour of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	He most recently worked as a pitching trainer in a Havana  
province. 
</P>
<P>
	He was known as ``el Pequeno Gigante del Box,'' which means the  
Little Big Man in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials denied that any members of the delegation had  
defected but said six Cubans had overslept and missed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defectors,'' the spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic  
mission in Washington, Luis Fernandez, told The Associated Press. 
``I have no information that there are any defectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six were planning to catch another flight home  
either Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a senior administration official said the  
government was making arrangements to talk to the six -- despite the 
Justice Department conclusion -- to learn whether they want to 
return voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS would not comment on possible defections or say if the  
agency had been contacted by the six. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 Cubans were part of the delegation that attended  
Monday night's game, which the Cuban all-stars won 12-6. Besides 
players, the delegation included journalists, retired ballplayers, 
ordinary citizens, members of youth groups and outstanding 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have an annual payroll of more than $78 million, the  
Cubans about $2,250. 
</P>
<P>
	During a long speech welcoming the players at Havana University,  
Castro criticized defections in general but gave no indication that 
anyone had stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, a rematch after the Orioles defeated Cuba 3-2 at  
Havana on March 28, was surrounded by controversy. Hundreds of 
protesters gathered outside Camden Yards to speak out against 
Castro, while a smaller group supporting the lifting of sanctions 
against Cuba protested nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, a Cuban umpire punched and body-slammed a  
demonstrator who had run onto the field carrying an anti-Castro 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninoska Perez, spokeswoman for Cuban American National  
Foundation, a Miami-based exile group, said the defection proves 
there is no ``good will'' behind the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the violence that was used by the umpire with one  
of the protesters and the fact that everyone in the delegation was 
under such strict custody, shows there's no good will,'' Perez 
said. ``It's just playing into the hands of the dictatorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Orioles became the first major league team in 40  
years to play in Cuba. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> DeLorean Develops New Sports Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John DeLorean has another sports car in the  
works. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean once made a stainless steel car with signature  
gull-wing doors, but he fell from prominence after legal 
entanglements in the 1980s, including bankruptcy, divorce and an 
acquittal on cocaine smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look back at all,'' said DeLorean, whose latest  
project is a 1,450-pound sports car built from structural plastic 
that can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting price would be about $18,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cars are in my blood,'' he said. ``They're really the only  
thing I've ever worked at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean, 74, once spent a lot of time at his 48-acre citrus and  
avocado ranch in San Diego County, but he gave it to his attorneys 
to pay legal fees. He now splits his time between Bedminster, N.J., 
and New York City.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Holds Big Lead Over Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has taken a strong lead over  
Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire in the race for the Republican 
presidential nomination, and retains a big advantage nationally, 
according to two polls released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore has expanded his  
lead over Bill Bradley, former senator from New Jersey, according 
to a national poll of Democrats by CNN-USA Today-Gallup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had 66 percent in the poll, while Bradley had 23 percent.  
In mid-April, Bradley trailed Gore 54 percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll is evidence of Gore's growing strength among Democrats,  
said his spokesman, Roger Salazar. ``As people get to know him 
better, we should only gain ground,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads Gore in a theoretical head-to-head match by 56  
percent to 40 percent, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, about the 
same lead Bush has held over Gore since February. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Hampshire poll taken by the University of New Hampshire  
for CNN-WMUR, shows Bush, the Texas governor, at 37 percent, 
followed by Dole, a former Red Cross president, at 16 percent. Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona, who has improved his standing, is now 
challenging Dole for second with 14 percent. A poll taken in 
January had Bush and Dole in a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Among New Hampshire Democrats, Gore was favored by 68 percent  
and Bradley by 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national poll of Republicans, Bush was favored by 42  
percent and Dole by 24 percent. In mid April, Bush led Dole by a 53 
percent-16 percent margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said the  
governor won't be traveling nationally until mid June because the 
Texas legislature is meeting until the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	But she noted the campaign has pulled together its New Hampshire  
organization in the last month and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., 
endorsed Bush in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 411 Republicans and 492  
Democrats was taken Friday through Sunday and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 5 percentage points for each group. The New 
Hampshire poll of 279 likely Republican voters had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 6 percentage points, while the poll of 202 
likely Democratic voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 7 
percent. That poll was taken April 26-May 2.

<HEADLINE> Emotional Reunions for Ex-POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Happily reunited with their families,  
three U.S. Army soldiers got a clean bill of health today after a 
month of captivity in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Checkups of the soldiers at a U.S. military hospital in Germany  
have revealed fractured ribs and a broken nose, raising questions 
about how they were treated during their capture and imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Col. Mack Blanton, chief of clinical services at Landstuhl  
Regional Medical Center, said today ``they require no further 
in-patient care or treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a comprehensive medical evaluation and they are  
fine and in good health,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army refused comment on how the injuries were sustained,  
citing the continuing investigation into the circumstances of their 
March 31 capture on the Yugoslav-Macedonia border. 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving at Landstuhl on Sunday from the Yugoslav capital  
of Belgrade, the soldiers told reporters their scars and bruises 
stemmed from their capture, but said they were generally treated 
well after that. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers remained at the hospital today to spend more time  
with their families and readjust. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
said the three soldiers would undergo debriefings in Germany for 
two or three more days. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial debriefings have reaffirmed U.S. officials' belief  
that the soldiers were captured inside Macedonia, Bacon said. Serb 
authorities have claimed the three were in Serb territory when 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking 30 days of leave, the soldiers were likely to  
return to their units based in Germany, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid hugs, laughter and tears of joy, the servicemen were  
reunited with family members at Landstuhl on their first full day 
of freedom Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After private reunions, Staff Sgts. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los  
Angeles and Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., Spec. 
Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas, and their families 
stepped onto a sunny hospital balcony decorated with flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaming and holding on to each other, they waved briefly to  
reporters and photographers across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	The families were to remain in Germany for a few days with the  
soldiers. That raised the possibility of a meeting with President 
Clinton, who was expected Wednesday in Germany for a previously 
planned visit to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would like to  
meet with the three servicemen but he did not want to delay their 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical tests revealed that Ramirez had two fractured ribs, one  
on each side, and Stone had a fractured nose. Blanton said the 
fractures were already starting to heal and required no treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	After being released in Belgrade on Sunday, the soldiers  
traveled by bus to Croatia and then were flown to Germany, 
accompanied by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who had 
negotiated their release with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hoped Clinton would reciprocate by offering a respite  
from airstrikes, now in their sixth week. But NATO refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson met with Clinton on Monday and discussed a letter from  
Milosevic with proposals to resolve the crisis over Kosovo. Jackson 
also asked Clinton to release two Yugoslav prisoners of war as a 
goodwill gesture. There was no immediate response to the request 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing his gratitude to Jackson, Clinton said he was pleased  
at the soldiers' release but added the United States cannot forget 
the plight of the thousands of refugees forced out of Kosovo by 
Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``When will these people see their home again, with the safety  
and rights Mr. Milosevic has often pledged but never delivered?'' 
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> GAO Warns of Sniper Rifle Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military sniper rifles like those used to stop  
Iraqi tanks during the Gulf War are now in the hands of thousands 
of civilians, including suspected terrorists and drug dealers, 
according to congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
wing of Congress, found that long-range, armor-piercing .50-caliber 
rifles are readily available through dealers, gun shows and the 
Internet. Buyers only need to prove that they are 18 years old and 
don't have a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The agents also told a Democratic-organized hearing Monday that  
sellers of armor-piercing ammunition used in the semiautomatic 
weapons were willing to do business with them even when the agents, 
pretending to be buyers, said they wanted to attack armored 
limousines or ``take a helicopter down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GAO agent Robert Hast said the long-range weapons gained  
popularity after they were used to attack Iraqi tanks in the 1991 
Persian Gulf War. The weapons are highly accurate up to 2,000 yards 
-- meaning a marksman could stand at the Lincoln Memorial in 
Washington and hit a target at the Pentagon in Virginia -- and can 
be effective at distances of 7,500 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Most deer hunters, by contrast, shoot at ranges of 150 to 200  
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gast said that because gunmakers are not required to provide  
information on the caliber of weapons they sell, it's not clear how 
many of the high-powered weapons are in circulation. But one major 
producer sold more than 2,800 to civilians in the 1987-98 period, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has tracked several  
of those sniper rifles to a Mexican drug cartel, suspected 
terrorists, a mentally ill cop killer and the Branch Davidians 
during the 1993 siege near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a subculture growing in this country about the use of  
these weapons,'' said Tom Diaz of the Violence Policy Center, 
calling them ``the ideal tool for assassination and destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz urged Congress to pass legislation putting .50-caliber  
rifles under the same restrictions imposed on machine guns and 
weapons of war, and banning armor-piercing ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., who commissioned the investigation  
with Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., plans to offer legislation 
restricting sales of the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	James Schmidt, head of an Arizona ammunition manufacturer and a  
director for the 50-Caliber Shooters Association, said the rifles 
were not a social threat because they were heavy, costly at more 
than $6,000 and difficult to use for rapid-fire shooting. ``This is 
not a rifle that one would carry very far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz said the weapons were being sold in ``an increasingly weird  
cultural context'' that ``glorifies the sniper mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said two .50-caliber sniper rifles were used by the Branch  
Davidians in the 1993 siege near Waco, Texas, one reason law 
enforcement officials had to use armored personnel carriers.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Makes Bid for Coffee Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. launched a hostile takeover bid  
for Chock full o'Nuts Corp. as it seeks to expand its coffee 
business and compete better against giant Starbucks Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer announced Tuesday to shareholders of the New York  
City-based coffee company is essentially the same as Sara Lee's 
$223 million cash offer that was rejected by the Chock full o'Nuts 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Ball Park hot dogs, Coach leather goods and other  
products said its offer depended on getting at least two-thirds of 
the approximately 10.8 million shares outstanding and a repeal of 
formidable takeover defenses initiated by Chock full o'Nut's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee is offering $10.50 cash for each Chock full o'Nuts  
share, $1,275.82 for bonds due in 2012 and $1,344.43 for bonds due 
in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represents a 65 percent premium to Chock full o'Nuts'  
closing stock price of $6.38 a share on April 22, the day 
Chicago-based Sara Lee said in a federal filing it is interested in 
acquiring the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Chock full o'Nut's stock was up $1.06 1/4 at $10.50 in midday  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be hopeful that the directors of Chock full  
o'Nuts will ultimately recognize the benefits of a transaction on 
the terms that we have proposed,'' said C. Steven McMillan, Sara's 
Lee's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee last year had revenues in excess of $20 billion while  
Chock full o'Nuts had sales of $396.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee would roll Chock full o'Nuts into its Superior Coffee  
division if the takeover is successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Chock full o'Nuts roasts, packs and markets a variety of  
coffees. It sells them in the United States and Canada under the 
names Cain's, LaTouraine and Chock full o'Nuts in supermarkets, to 
airlines, hospitals and others. It also owns and franchises a chain 
of 40 drive-through coffee outlets called Quikava.

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Leads Vegas Mayor's Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A lawyer who defended mob figures such as Meyer Lansky was  
leading Las Vegas' mayoral election Tuesday night, while Denver 
Mayor Wellington Webb rode his city's strong economy to a third 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Midwestern cities where incumbents are not running also  
held mayoral races. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman pumped his fist and led cheers from  
his supporters as returns showed him leading a nine-person field 
with just under 50 percent of the vote -- the mark he needed to 
cross to win the mayor's job outright. 
</P>
<P>
	If Goodman does not top 50 percent, he would face the  
second-place finisher on June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``This city's going to really hum, hopefully sooner than  
later,'' Goodman said. ``This is the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 59, for years was called the mouthpiece for the mob  
because of his vigorous defense of people like Lansky and Tony 
``the Ant'' Spilotro, the gangster who legend has it put a rival's 
head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out. Goodman played 
himself in Martin Scorsese's ``Casino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman campaigned as a populist and defender of the defenseless  
who would break up the city's good-old-boy network. 
</P>
<P>
	One rival, City Councilman Arnie Adamsen, said electing Goodman  
would set the city's reputation back 50 years. But Adamsen and 
developer Mark Fine, another leading candidate, also spent much of 
their time attacking each other, to Goodman's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	With 29 percent of precincts reporting, Goodman had 49 percent  
of the vote. Adamsen was second with 31 percent and Fine had 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With 32 percent of precincts reporting, Webb, a Democrat, had  
picked up 81 percent of the vote and became the first Denver mayor 
to win without a runoff since 1979. His three opponents had 
struggled to raise money, and two-thirds of voters polled three 
weeks ago could not name one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, president-elect of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said he  
hoped to use his third term to continue increasing public safety, 
protecting parks and open space and creating economic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most expensive mayoral race ever in Lincoln, Neb.,  
former state Sen. Don Wesely, a Democrat, defeated Republican City 
Councilwoman Cindy Johnson 56 percent to 44 percent. Wesely 
succeeds Republican Mike Johanns, who was elected governor last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesely and Ms. Johnson spent a combined $420,000 on the  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates made crime-fighting a major issue in Indianapolis,  
which has seen record-breaking numbers of homicides the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are trying to take over the mayor's post for the first  
time in 30 years, and on Tuesday they nominated Bart Peterson, a 
developer who was former Gov. Evan Bayh's chief of staff. Indiana 
Secretary of State Sue Anne Gilroy was selected as the GOP nominee 
to succeed Stephen Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, Ohio, will have its first female mayor or first black  
mayor after the November election. Republican Dorothy Teater and 
Democrat Michael Coleman, who is black, were the top two finishers 
in a three-way nonpartisan primary on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola To Acquire Orangina Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. has signed a $758 million deal to  
acquire the soft drink brand Orangina from French beverage company 
Pernod Ricard -- an acquisition blocked by France for nearly 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies announced in a joint press release that the new  
agreement is intended to respond to the concerns of French 
competition authorities by excluding Coca-Cola from distributing 
Orangina in French restaurants, bars and hotels for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke will be allowed to sell the orange-flavored drink in French  
stores for customers to take home, which makes up some 80 percent 
of the market for the drink in that country. The restriction does 
not apply to Coke's rights to sell Orangina in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pernod originally announced plans to sell Orangina to Coca-Cola  
in December 1997, but the government blocked the purchase. 
Orangina's distribution rights in the French on-premise market had 
been the main sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, France's highest judicial authority upheld the  
French government's veto on Coca-Cola's acquisition of Orangina. 
</P>
<P>
	Other soft drinks companies, including Pepsico Inc., rely on  
Orangina's distribution network in the French market. The 
government was concerned that these companies would lose their 
distribution outlet if not given the time to find a new partner.

<HEADLINE> At Least 43 Die in Plains Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Rescue crews looking for signs of life  
picked through shattered homes, twisted trees and mangled cars 
Tuesday after a swarm of astonishingly powerful tornadoes chewed up 
entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and Kansas and killed at least 43 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an area accustomed to twisters and strong thunderstorms  
-- this is, after all, the region known as Tornado Alley, and spring 
is an especially dangerous time of year -- the twisters' wrath was 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	One monstrous funnel cloud skipped across the ground for four  
hours and was classified F-5, the most powerful tornado there is, 
with winds of more than 260 mph. It cut a path one mile wide, and 
along with the other twisters tore up 60 miles of the flat 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' said Eric Peterson of Haysville, Kan., a  
suburb of Wichita, after a twister pushed a tree into his bedroom. 
``I have been in typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, 
but this tops it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll was 38 in Oklahoma and five in Kansas, including  
a month-old baby in Haysville. And the same system produced a 
tornado in northeast Texas on Tuesday. One person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak since 42 people  
were killed last year in Florida. It was also the deadliest such 
tragedy to hit Oklahoma since 1947, when a twister killed 113 
people in Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were injured, including 500 in Oklahoma City and more  
than 100 in Wichita. At least 1,500 businesses and homes were 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars were tossed across highways and crushed like soda cans.  
Houses were smashed into piles of splintered timbers and brick. The 
ground was scoured bare in places, stripped of trees. The air 
smelled like sawdust. Baby pictures floated down the streets in 
storm water. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City, likened  
the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing in 1995: ``It looks like 
the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories tall, it's spread 
out over a large area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the death toll could have been worse if people  
had not heeded warnings to take cover underground. Local TV 
stations went live with coverage of the developing storm at least 
two hours before it hit the heavily populated Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating estimated that hundreds of millions  
of dollars of damage was done. He mobilized the National Guard to 
help with the rescue, and tanks joined police and fire vehicles in 
blocking streets where the heaviest destruction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers conducted two preliminary searches for victims, then  
brought in bulldozers to clear away heavy debris in a third search 
during the afternoon. At least one woman was found alive in a 
trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be someone, somewhere, still out there, under the  
clutter,'' said John Vears, one of the hundreds of volunteer 
searchers and emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most homes in Oklahoma are built on concrete slabs and don't  
have cellars where people can take shelter. When a tornado draws 
near, people are urged to take shelter in a structurally sound, 
centrally located space in the house, such as a bathroom, a closet 
or under a staircase. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dennis McCarthy, chief meteorologist for the National  
Weather Service in Norman, said some deaths may have been 
unavoidable. ``With a storm of this intensity and this magnitude, 
sometimes even if you do the right things, sometime you just don't 
have enough shelter,'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Knapp, a Red Cross volunteer at an evacuation shelter in  
Newcastle, said she was taking her son to T-ball practice but 
turned around when a funnel cloud came into view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in several of them in my lifetime. But this was a  
big one,'' she said. ``This did more damage than I've ever seen in 
my life. There are dead cattle in people's yard, trees, debris. 
Grass was ripped up. At some homes, the foundations were ripped 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Smith was visiting her grandparents when a tornado tore  
through her neighborhood in Midwest City, just outside Oklahoma 
City. She spent Tuesday rummaging through the remains of what once 
was her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got here, I could only tell it was our house because  
of the bushes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Poahty was still in shock as she looked at her neighbor's  
car, which had been hurled into her living room. Her son's mattress 
was in a tree and the family car was 100 yards away in a neighbor's 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
	She was able to salvage something, however: She found a small  
black bag on the floor, opened it and pulled out a glass bottle. 
``My perfume survived,'' she said. ``It was my favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated the tornadoes traveled as much as 80 miles  
after forming 45 miles south of Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon. 
Over the next 20 hours, as many as four dozen tornadoes developed. 
The same system spawned the Kansas tornado, which struck about 8:30 
p.m. Monday. It cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
At least 150 houses and 27 businesses were damaged or destroyed in 
Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Zehr, 44, figured he would be safe inside the  
cinderblock warehouse where he was working when the tornado struck 
Haysville. Then he was lifted 4 feet in the air and dropped back 
down. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cisco Wants To Be Household Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- First they figured out a better way for  
linking computers together. Then they made a fortune selling it to 
virtually everyone doing business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Cisco Systems wants to become a household name.  
</P>
<P>
	``My mother still thinks I'm working for the food service  
industry,'' chief executive John Chambers joked during a speech to 
local business leaders, alluding to SYSCO, a company that delivers 
meals to hotels, schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	An identity crisis for the third largest company listed on the  
Nasdaq stock exchange? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes indeed. Cisco is to networking gear what Microsoft is to  
operating system software, but don't expect your neighbors to know 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of business owners and technology service providers  
conducted by Cisco found that bigger companies, those with 100 or 
more employees, knew the name Cisco, but it was obscure to the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our goals is to convey Cisco's key role in this new  
Internet world, and convey the 'urgency' and 'opportunity' behind 
this change,'' said Keith Fox, Cisco's vice president of corporate 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco was started in 1984 by two Stanford University graduates,  
Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, who had a plan for connecting 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco shipped its first router in 1986, and today controls  
roughly 85 percent of the world's market for routers and switches -- 
which direct data around computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the company went public in 1990, it had $69 million in  
revenues and 254 employees. Last year, it had about $8.5 billion in 
revenue and 18,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're changing the way people work, live, play and learn,''  
said Barbara Beck, a senior vice president in human resources who 
joined Cisco in 1989. ``We see ourselves doing a great thing and 
making a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cisco has plans for the future as well. It wants to become a  
major player in the telecom equipment business, going up against 
companies such as Lucent Technologies and Nortel. 
</P>
<P>
	So what to do about that brand-recognition problem?  
</P>
<P>
	Cisco last fall launched a $60 million worldwide ad campaign --  
half of which is being spent in the United States -- for a series of 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	In one TV ad, Cisco takes credit for the World Wide Web.  
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually all Internet traffic travels along the systems of  
one company, Cisco Systems. Empowering the Internet generation,'' 
the ad boasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving Cisco credit for backing the entire Internet takes ``a  
leap of faith,'' said Mark Fabbi, research director at the Internet 
analyst firm Gartner Group, 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly they played an important role in helping the Internet  
roll out, but this is a little bit of marketing hype,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain further recognition, the company is pushing a marketing  
program that allows companies using Cisco products to put a small 
``Cisco NetWorks'' label on their television, computer or other 
device -- similar to the ``Intel Inside'' marketing campaign that 
Intel puts on computers containing a Pentium microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
	And the next step will be getting the world's microwave ovens,  
pianos and toasters -- anything that can hold a computer chip -- 
wired with Cisco's products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is to create an Internet ecosystem that will  
eventually connect everyone to everything,'' said Don Listwin, the 
executive vice president heading Cisco's push into the mainstream 
consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
	Can it be done?  
</P>
<P>
	In March, Cisco announced plans to build a $1 billion facility  
for more than 20,000 workers on 400 acres in a largely undeveloped 
area of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get pretty pumped up when I talk about our vision,'' said  
Mike Volpi, who joined Cisco five years ago and worked his way up 
to vice president of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as much preaching as it is selling.''

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Seems Headed for NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- All American guard Richard Hamilton  
apparently is leaving national champion Connecticut for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton called a news conference for today and was expected to  
announce he is passing up his final year of eligibility and would 
make himself available for next month's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn's other star guard, Khalid El-Amin, announced in April  
that he would return to Storrs for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Tolokan, UConn's sports information director, would not  
confirm media reports that Hamilton was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 swingman was the heart of the Huskies' championship  
season. He averaged 19.7 points a game and become the 
second-highest scorer in school history with 2,036 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton was an All-American and co-Player of the Year in the  
Big East Conference, joining Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin as the 
only two-time winners of that award. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton flirted with the idea of turning pro before his junior  
season, but was lured back to campus by the prospect of making a 
run at the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies upset Duke 77-74 to win their first national  
championship in March.

<HEADLINE> Hi-Tech Political Arm Gets New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- A top lawyer for Netscape Communications who  
played a prominent role in the federal government's antitrust 
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. was named president of the 
Technology Network on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Netscape and archrival Microsoft are members of influential  
TechNet, the high-tech industry's bipartisan political arm. As 
TechNet president, Roberta Katz will now represent both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is Roberta's past life, and she is now in a role that  
focuses totally on industry issues common to all high-tech 
companies,'' said Reed Hastings, the outgoing first president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings is leaving to run an Internet startup firm that offers  
online video rental services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his leadership, 2-year-old TechNet emerged as a powerful  
player in state and federal politics and policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
	TechNet was formed after the industry fought Proposition 211, an  
unsuccessful initiative on California's November 1996 ballot that 
would have made it easier for shareholders to sue companies when 
the stock price drops. 
</P>
<P>
	In its suit, the Justice Department accused Microsoft of  
unfairly using the dominance of its Windows operating system to 
make inroads into the Internet browser market, where it competes 
with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape was recently acquired by America Online Inc. for nearly  
$10 billion, a move that Microsoft contends means that competition 
is thriving in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial has been in recess since Feb. 26 and is not expected  
to resume before May 24. Katz will have no further involvement in 
the case.

<HEADLINE> Record Fine in Price-Fixing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The world's largest producer of graphite and  
carbon products agreed to pay a record $135 million fine and plead 
guilty to scheming with competitors to fix prices and divide the 
world market among them, federal officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SGL Carbon Aktiengesellschaft, headquartered in Wiesbaden,  
Germany, is the fourth company the U.S. Justice Department has 
charged with scheming in a cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Koehler, SGL Carbon's chief executive officer, has  
also agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine against 
an individual, according to the charge filed in U.S. District Court 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme, operated from about July 1992 until June 1997,  
forced steelmakers to pay higher, noncompetitive prices to 
manufacture consumer items, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	SGL Carbon agreed to pay the fine ``to resolve the issue and  
avoid potentially lengthy litigation,'' a company spokesman in 
Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charged that SGL Carbon and its co-conspirators  
used code names and met in the Far East, Europe and the United 
States to rig the price and production volume of graphite 
electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartel companies produce graphite electrodes for a  
fast-growing segment of the steel industry -- mini-mills -- that now 
account for half of U.S. steel production, the Justice Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The electrodes are large columns generate intense heat needed to  
melt scrap and further refine steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused agreed to increase prices, eliminate discounts and  
allocate the volume and region each competitor could sell the 
electrodes in, the government said. They also agreed to restrict 
non-conspiring competitors' access to new technology, the charge 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of steel companies are seeking unspecified compensation  
from SGL Carbon, the spokesman said. The company has settled some 
cases in Canada and is working to settle cases in the United 
States. It has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest previous antitrust fine was $110 million from  
America's leading producer of graphite electrodes, UCAR 
International Inc., which pleaded guilty one year ago to scheming 
in the same cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Total sales of graphite electrodes in this country were  
estimated at more than $1.75 billion over the course of the scheme, 
federal officials said.

<HEADLINE> AP Photographer Weathers Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                   *Associated Press Photographer    	
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- I drove into the heart of the storm, my  
police scanner screaming, the radio broadcasting warnings of the 
approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The sky turned midnight dark and hail pounded the roof of my  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rain stopped and there was no more hail. Just quiet. An  
eerie quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, debris flew and I saw it -- the funnel cloud, a  
quarter- to a half-mile away, straddling the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	I have chased tornadoes for a quarter-century, but this was the  
first I had seen on the ground. I stood there, a half-mile away, 
shooting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	I got back in my car and began driving. I stopped and shot more  
pictures. By now, it was so close I had to use a wide-angle lens. 
</P>
<P>
	I drove, I stopped, I shot. And then I realized the storm was so  
close I had no place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	I got out of my truck at an overpass and spotted a woman  
standing beside her van. I yelled at her to get against the pillars 
supporting the overpass. She ran to the side of her van for her two 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	I helped her get one girl out of the car seat, then I pushed and  
shoved them to the pillar and put my back to the storm. I stopped 
shooting when the funnel was maybe 150 feet away. By then, I could 
no longer stand. 
</P>
<P>
	I was hit by flying debris. I felt one of my two pagers slide  
out of its holder and bang against me. The pager went up in the 
tornado and vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	I hugged the little girls and the woman and kept telling it  
would be OK and to keep their faces down and not to look up. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was gone. The funnel crossed the expressway and we were  
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as I could stand, I began taking pictures again. The  
wind was still strong. The funnel cloud was less than 50 yards 
away. The wind was howling and I could barely stand, but the storm 
was moving away. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman asked if it was safe to continue on to Lawton, and I  
said it seemed OK. 
</P>
<P>
	In all the confusion, I forgot one basic rule of journalism.  
</P>
<P>
	I never got her name.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> SI, Sport To Mark End of Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sports Illustrated and Sport Magazine both are  
marking the end of the century with special features. 
</P>
<P>
	SI, in its issue out this week, lists its favorite dynasties of  
the 20th Century. No. 1 is the Boston Celtics from 1957-69. 
</P>
<P>
	The club won 11 NBA titles in those 13 years, led by Bill  
Russell and Bob Cousy and coached by Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame teams from 1946-49 are No. 2 on the list. In four  
years under coach Frank Leahy, Notre Dame went 36-0-2 and won three 
national titles. That dynasty produced Heisman Trophy winners 
Johnny Lujack and Leon Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA basketball in 1964-1976 is fourth followed by the New York  
Yankees teams from 1947-1962, winners of 10 championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sport Magazine, in its next issue, presents baseball's top 10  
moments of the last 100 years. Jackie Robinson's historic debut 
with the Dodgers in 1947 tops the list, followed by Joe DiMaggio's 
56-game hitting streak in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire's record home run barrage last year is No. 4,  
behind Ted Williams putting his .400 batting average on the line in 
1941. None of the greatest moments of the century happened before 
1941, according to the panel of baseball people.

<HEADLINE> IOC Clears Kim, but Not Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders are extending their  
investigation of one high-ranking official and closing the case 
against another caught in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's executive board said it  
had ``no new element'' of evidence to justify further action 
against Kim Un-yong, a board member and international sports 
power-broker. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board said there was enough new information to extend  
its investigation of a second leading member, Australia's Phil 
Coles, who like Kim received a severe warning from an earlier 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles could face expulsion from the IOC if the investigation  
finds he violated more rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel was appointed to report its latest findings  
by June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think and I hope this case will be settled'' by the IOC's  
June session in Seoul, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an executive board member from Australia, said a  
decision could come sooner than that, adding that Coles might be 
called to appear before the new panel, made up of board members 
Keba Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz and Marc Hodler. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim risked expulsion if it was proved he knew that Salt Lake  
City bidders helped pay for his son's salary at a 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board appointed Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States and Switzerland's Marc Hodler to conduct further 
investigations of the Coles case. 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving new information on Kim, the IOC's top  
officials decided that ``no new element at present justifies going 
beyond the severe warning,'' IOC vice president Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was cited originally for accepting travel and  
accommodation perks from Salt Lake City. He was put under renewed 
scrutiny after his ex-wife claimed representatives of Athens' 
unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics gave the couple jewelry 
worth $6,000. He consistently denied the claims and refused to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence emerged Tuesday, when Australian media said Salt  
Lake City had obtained confidential briefing notes by Coles on how 
other IOC members could be trusted to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said this all along, there are certain people out to  
get me and I am going to fight them,'' said Coles, who said he had 
made weekly and sometimes daily reports on IOC members during 
Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent that back to the Sydney office and that is the last I  
heard of it,'' he said. Up to 40 people would have had access to 
the documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Salt Lake Olympic leader Tom Welch told The Salt Lake  
Tribune that Salt Lake and Sydney were ``pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney was really helpful to us,'' he said. ``When they'd have  
events (to entertain IOC members), Sydney would invite us. What 
people don't realize is that Salt Lake had become part of the 
Olympic family. We had been around so long, we weren't just a bid 
city any more. We cooperated with a lot of cities and talked 
process, including Beijing,'' which lost to Sydney by two votes in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coles never gave me any information that was inappropriate,''  
Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the allegations will be subject to ``a single investigation  
and a single decision,'' Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had profiles done on IOC members before, ad nauseam,''  
Gosper said. ``I think the real issue here is how these files ended 
up in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to comment on what fate might await Coles.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act with facts, not with information,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As well as completion of the Coles investigation, June will see  
the first meeting of the IOC 2000 commission, whose 80 members were 
unveiled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform panel, which Samaranch originally said would have  
20-24 members, was set up in March to help the committee rebuild 
after the biggest scandal in its 105-year history. Ten IOC members 
have resigned or been expelled.

<HEADLINE> NHL Concerned About Penguins Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The National Hockey League, concerned that the  
Pittsburgh Penguins' bankruptcy will delay planning for next 
season, is about to press for the case to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, which supports Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux's bid for  
the team, could ask a U.S. bankruptcy judge as early as Wednesday 
to begin the process to terminate the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the league wants Lemieux to gain control of the team,  
it is concerned that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will 
not hold a confirmation hearing on Lemieux's plan until June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The league earlier set a May 31 date for the Penguins' case to  
be wrapped up, and William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal 
affairs, said June 24 may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, players sign contracts, season ticket-selling campaigns  
begin and game schedules are set. If a Lemieux plan is not approved 
by the end of this month, the league could move on its own, without 
bankruptcy court intervention, to relocate the team or dissolve the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could fold the Penguins' franchise, then award it to  
Lemieux. But, under that scenario, the Penguins probably could not 
play in the Civic Arena because of the current franchise's 
long-term lease to play there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very, very concerned about the 24th,'' Daly told the  
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. ``We're studying whether we can live 
with that date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who is owed $32 million by the team, and his 10  
partners have bid $50 million for the Penguins. The NHL has 
endorsed his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Cuban, a Dallas-based Internet company founder, emerged  
last week as a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother, Dallas employment attorney Brian Cuban, are  
suburban Pittsburgh natives. Brian Cuban said Monday that he and 
his brother have met with Lemieux and also plan to meet with 
current Penguins co-owner Roger Marino and another potential buyer, 
Florida investment banker Charles ``Chip'' Gesner Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Gesner helped Kevin McClatchy buy the Pittsburgh Pirates in  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will meet with anyone willing to save the team and keep  
them in Pittsburgh,'' Brian Cuban said. ``Anything's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harry L. Manion III, Marino's attorney, and Gesner said they  
would welcome a partnership with the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're local guys,'' Gesner said. ``They bring a lot to the  
table. I'd love to have them part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gesner, who represents up to seven undisclosed investors, said  
he is negotiating a reorganization plan for the Penguins. He 
declined to say when his plan would be submitted to Markovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Cuban helped found Broadcast.com, an Internet site that  
carries radio and TV broadcasts, sporting events and concerts on 
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recorded $22.4 million in sales last year, a 145  
percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October. The team has an  
estimated worth of $75 million to $95 million and owes 
approximately $145 million.

chairman Ely Callaway is thinking about taking another case to the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind this complaint is what is -- and isn't -- in the bag.  
</P>
<P>
	Without naming names, Callaway referred to Ted Tryba carrying an  
Orlimar bag during the Nissan Open, where he shot a 61 in the third 
round, and Dudley Hart carrying an Adams bag and wearing the cap in 
the Greater Greensboro Classic, where he tied for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Darrell Survey, neither player had a single  
club from the respective company in the bag that week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there's been a lot of hanky-panky going on for years,  
but I've never seen anything quite this blatant,'' Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our current thinking that probably the only way to  
eliminate these types of deceptive and misleading advertising and 
promotional practices by a few of our competitors is to bring our 
complaint directly to the Federal Trade Commission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead, said the founder of Adams Golf.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ely is just trying to protect his franchise,'' Barney Adams  
said. ``This is much ado about nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Hart carries the Tight Lies 4-wood, but when he got  
to Greensboro and saw the fast conditions decided to use a 3-wood 
that week. Adams didn't have one ready with his specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway also accused Adams of using Nick Faldo in its  
infomercial for the SC Series driver, but not using one in the MCI 
Classic. Adams said Faldo wanted to change his specs on the driver 
that week, but noted that Faldo used the Adams driver the week 
before (the Masters) and after (the Spanish Open). 
</P>
<P>
	``What Ely has chosen to do in this case is pick and choose,''  
Adams said. ``As a result, he's guilty of being as deceptive as 
he's accusing us of being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orlimar co-chairman Rich Oldenburg says Tryba is not one of its  
staff players and ``is free to carry any bag he chooses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not paying him an endorsement and we're not using him in  
our advertisements,'' Oldenburg said, although he added that Tryba 
is working with some of the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway says all but one of its 45 staff players carry at least  
10 clubs. The exception is Paul Azinger, who carries only the 
fairway metals and has a logo that says just that on the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Ping requires its professionals to carry at least 12 clubs,  
including the putter. If a player uses the Ping ISI driver, he only 
has to carry 11 clubs plus the putter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ely wants to change the tour to 10-club contracts, my  
answer is don't talk to me,'' Adams said. ``Go talk to guys like 
IMG. They're the ones who set the deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOVE HURTS:* Davis Love III had a strong stretch the last few  
months, getting into contention in the Bay Hill Invitational and 
The Players Championship and finishing second in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has taken a toll. Love withdrew from the MCI Classic with  
back problems, then decided against going to Japan to defend his 
title in the Chunichi Crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The next question is how soon he will recover. Love has pulled  
out of this week's Compaq Classic in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STROKE START:* The American Stroke Challenge got off to a  
rousing start in New York's Central Park when Nancy Lopez holed a 
20-yard chip worth $50,000 and Corey Pavin made one worth $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their birdies during the Monday exhibition, they  
raised $93,500 for the American Stroke Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of it will come from tournaments in the month of May.  
Bayer Aspirin will donate $1,500 for every birdie they make on 
tour. The goal is to raise $250,000 by the end of the month.

</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN ENTRIES:* A record 7,889 people have entered qualifying  
for the U.S. Open at Pinehurst, an increase of 772 from 1998.	   More than 2,500 arrived on the last three days before the April 
28 deadline, and 404 were turned down because they either had a 
poor record in past qualifiers or had a handicap index higher than 
1.4.

quiet in her life, which was bad news for the beagle she got last 
year and named ``Happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a preview of the U.S. Women's Open at Old Waverly Golf  
Club in Mississippi, the defending champion introduced her new best 
friend -- a 7-month old miniature schnauzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I had a beagle, but she was too rough. Tear  
everything up,'' Pak said. ``She didn't want to sleep when time to 
sleep. I needed a quiet dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the new dog? Happy, of course.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* According to the Darrell Survey, more players used  
Softspikes than metal spikes in the Greater Greensboro Classic, the 
first time that's happened in PGA Tour history. ... Stuart Appleby 
has won all three of his PGA Tour events on TPC courses -- Heron Bay 
(Honda Classic), Avenel (Kemper Open) and The Woodlands (Houston 
Open). ... The U.S. Senior Open at Des Moines Golf and Country Club 
is a sellout for the first time in its 20-year history. Officials 
expect 30,000 a day at first major golf event in Iowa since the 
1963 U.S. Amateur. ... Brandie Burton had surgery on her right 
shoulder to remove excess scar tissue and won't be able to defend 
her title in the du Maurier Classic the last weekend in July. ... 
Barry Cheesman has played every PGA Tour event for which he has 
been eligible this year, a total of 15. ... Jim Furyk will be host

<HEADLINE> Coppola Teams With Nostradamus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Please mention Francis Ford Coppola  
prominently in connection with ``First Wave,'' urges Chris 
Brancato, creator of the new Sci-Fi Channel series about alien 
invaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider it done. Coppola, the series' executive producer,  
certainly is a name worth noting. Let's toss in another: 
Nostradamus, a guy who could have made a killing in the psychic hot 
line business and whose ancient writings are central to ``First 
Wave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what viewers might find more intriguing is a number, 66,  
which is the number of episodes the Sci-Fi Channel has ordered. 
Become attached to ``First Wave'' and you can feel reasonably 
secure it will be around for at least three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	That in itself is practically science fiction when it comes to  
the TV business, in which networks increasingly buy as few episodes 
as possible and bail out as quickly as possible if a show isn't an 
overnight hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment to ``First Wave'' is part of Sci-Fi Channel's  
increased emphasis on original shows, said Bonnie Hammer, senior 
vice president for programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Spielberg is producing a 20-hour alien-abduction  
miniseries called ``Taken,'' with a reported budget of at least $40 
million, set for late 2000. ``Farscape,'' an outer space series 
from Jim Henson Co. and Hallmark Entertainment, began in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the past number of years, the channel's done very well,''  
said Hammer. ``But with this new regime since (Barry) Diller's 
taken over, a lot of money is going into the channel to grow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diller is chairman of Sci-Fi Channel parent company USA Networks  
Inc., which came under his control in 1997 when his HSN Inc. (owner 
of Home Shopping Network) bought most of Universal Studios' TV 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancato has no qualms about playing second fiddle to Hollywood  
godfathers like Diller and Coppola. ``I'm happy to sacrifice 
myself,'' he said, a contented beneficiary of their celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, however; ``First Wave'' is his baby.  
</P>
<P>
	The series (which debuted in March and airs 10 p.m. EDT Friday)  
stars Sebastian Spence as Cade Foster, a reformed burglar whose 
staid life is shattered when he discovers undercover aliens are 
preparing Earth for a massive invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also learns he has survived grueling experiments aimed at  
testing the strength of the human spirit. Now he's on the run from 
the invaders and from the authorities, who want him for the murder 
of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder, of course, was the aliens' doing. Besides, any guy  
named Cade has to be a true-blue hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Guiding Foster are the predictions of Nostradamus, the  
16th-century physician and occultist whose vision of an invasion 
from above is, in ``First Wave,'' interpreted as warning of an 
alien attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is part ``The Fugitive,'' part ``The X-Files.''  
Fortunately, ``First Wave'' has a bit of the dark humor found in 
the latter, leavening what could otherwise be a ponderous brew. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, for example, an alien notes that a weak Earthling  
lasted a mere two weeks under testing; he was a tobacco industry 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancato acknowledges that aliens vs. us is hardly new to  
science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aliens are here, they want to take over -- yeah, yeah,  
yeah. You've heard that a thousand times before,'' he said. ``What 
I think makes our show different is the fact that they're here as 
an advance team. The second wave, which would be a full-scale 
military launch by these aliens, is something they're not even sure 
they can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to save his species, Foster gets to learn about it as  
well, ``which is what you want to be doing in a sci-fi show,'' 
Brancato said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have episodes about greed and about people's desire to  
get younger and all sorts of fun, 'Twilight Zone'-type of premises 
and subjects,'' he said. ``So if the aliens are doing an experiment 
trying to rile up skinheads in some mountain community, we can put 
Cade Foster in that situation and explore that aspect of 
humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brancato's credits include an ``X-Files'' script and the film  
``Species II,'' as well as two movies that are not sci-fi, 
``Hoodlum'' and the upcoming 1960s drama ``Weathermen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding gloss to the series is the dishy Spence, a Canadian who  
appeared in the films ``The Boys of St. Vincent'' (1994) and 
``Firestorm'' (1998), and the Showtime series ``Fast Track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``First Wave'' had an unusual beginning. It was sold overseas by  
co-producer Pearson Television International before it found a U.S. 
home, and began airing last year in Canada, South Africa and a 
half-dozen other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business model behind the show is groundbreaking in some  
respects,'' Brancato said. ``The foreign potential allowed a 
company to go ahead and make it without securing a U.S. broadcaster 
in advance. We were making the show come hell or high water even 
if, in the worst-case scenario, it was never even shown here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	ANCIENT ART: Centuries before European explorers ventured out to  
sea, Polynesians had sailed to the far corners of the Pacific. The 
resurgence of this ancient seagoing tradition is explored in 
``Wayfinders: A Pacific Odyssey,'' 10 p.m. EDT Thursday, May 6, on 
PBS (check local listings). Gail K. Evenari's film follows a 
community of Pacific Islanders as they build traditional canoes, 
learn how to navigate by the stars and embark on a 2,000-mile 
voyage.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Holds Big Lead Over Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore are riding high,  
both nationally and in New Hampshire, in their races for the 
Republican and Democratic nominations for president, according to 
two polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican front-runner, has taken a strong lead over  
Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire and retains a big advantage 
nationally. On the Democratic side, Gore has expanded his lead 
nationally over Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, 
to an almost 3-1 margin. In another poll, he holds a similar lead 
in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had 66 percent in the national CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll,  
while Bradley had 23 percent. In mid-April, Bradley trailed the 
vice president 54 percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls are evidence of Gore's growing strength among  
Democrats, said spokesman Roger Salazar. ``As people get to know 
him better, we should only gain ground,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads Gore in a theoretical head-to-head match by 56  
percent to 40 percent, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, about the 
same lead Bush has held over Gore since February. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Hampshire poll taken by the University of New Hampshire  
for CNN-WMUR, shows Bush, the Texas governor, at 37 percent, 
followed by Dole, the former Red Cross president, at 16 percent. 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has gained ground since January 
while advocating a tougher stance on Kosovo, was challenging Dole 
for second at 14 percent. A poll taken in January had Bush and Dole 
in a statistical dead heat, with McCain far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Among New Hampshire Democrats, Gore was favored by 68 percent  
and Bradley by 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national poll of Republicans, Bush was favored by 42  
percent and Dole by 24 percent. In mid-April, Bush led Dole by a 
53-16 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said the  
governor won't be traveling nationally until mid-June because the 
Texas Legislature is meeting until the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the campaign has pulled together its New Hampshire  
organization in the last month and noted that Sen. Judd Gregg, 
R-N.H., endorsed Bush in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 411 Republicans and 492  
Democrats was taken Friday through Sunday and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 5 percentage points for each group. The New 
Hampshire poll of 279 likely Republican voters had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 6 percentage points, while the poll of 202 
likely Democratic voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 7 
percent. The New Hampshire poll was taken April 26-May 2.

<HEADLINE> Teaxs Executes Man for 1987 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A parolee who blamed his crimes on  
inhaling spray paint fumes was executed by injection Tuesday for 
stabbing and robbing a disabled Corpus Christi man. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose De La Cruz, 31, was on parole for burglary when he killed  
24-year-old Domingo Rosas, the boyfriend of a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Cruz had stopped legal maneuvers on his behalf.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've already made amends with myself,'' he said in a recent  
death row interview. ``I'm at total peace with my case. I'm not 
innocent. That man had every right to live just like I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Cruz, who was 19 at the time of the 1987 killing, stabbed  
Rosas while he was in a wheelchair and stole a television, video 
recorder and stereo. The victim's neck was also broken. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Cruz said his addiction to inhaling spray paint, beginning  
at age 10, got him high and allowed him to fantasize, contributing 
to his criminal behavior.

	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dixie Chicks' brood is a little bigger.  
</P>
<P>
	Emily Erwin of the Texas-born country music group married fellow  
Texan and musician Charlie Robison on Saturday at a ranch.

<P>
	``Emily's such a perfectionist,'' Ms. Seidel said. ``It was out  
in this big courtyard. It was beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group's members sang ``Cowboy, Take Me Away'' at the  
wedding. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Disaster Declaration After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton acted swiftly today to  
declare 11 Oklahoma counties and one county in Kansas disaster 
areas, a move that he said would help in ``speeding the way for 
federal aid'' to areas damaged by tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official said Clinton would travel to Oklahoma  
City on Saturday to review the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the most powerful tornadoes ever recorded swept  
through these states last night,'' Clinton said today. ``Whole 
communities have been leveled. ... A lot of our fellow Americans 
have had everything taken from them in those two states, and I know 
they will be in your prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating had requested the federal emergency  
declaration in a letter delivered to the White House overnight. The 
president approved that request this morning and acted this morning 
to facilitate relief to Sedgwick County in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, also dispatched James Lee Witt, head of the Federal  
Emergency Management Agency, to Oklahoma City this morning and 
released a statement: 
</P>
<P>
	The designated Oklahoma counties are: Caddo, Cleveland, Creek,  
Grady, McClain, Oklahoma, Kingfisher, Lincoln, Logan, Pottawatomie 
and Tulsa.

	Offering greater protections for consumer privacy, Clinton noted  
that consumers receive 4 billion unsolicited credit card offers 
every year and that some people are duped by the small print. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that technology and competition have  
revolutionized the financial services industry,'' the president 
said at a White House ceremony. ``But many people ... don't have 
the knowlege to properly evaluate what is truly a dizzying array of 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also took a moment to defend the Community  
Reinvestment Act against Republican efforts to weaken it. The act, 
which spurs banks to lend in underdeveloped communities, has been 
in effect for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than 90 percent of the funds provided under the act  
have come in the last six years -- on Clinton's watch -- the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not done anything to hurt bank profits, and we ought to  
stay with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy proposals, according to a memo distributed at the  
White House, are meant to address consumer privacy issues at a time 
when cross-industry mergers and consolidation have given banks 
unprecedented access to their customers' financial and medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said too many consumers ``have fallen victim to abusive  
practices'' and said that the rule changes would give them ``the 
tools and the confidence they need to fully participate in a 
thriving but highly complex 21st century economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the proposals Clinton offered, many of which were  
introduced in January by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., were: 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring financial institutions to inform consumers of plans  
to share or sell their personal financial information, and giving 
consumers the power to stop such a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restricting any sharing of medical information within a  
financial conglomerate. ``As banks and insurance firms merge, for 
example, consumers should not fear that the results of a physical 
exam could be used to make a credit decision,'' the White House 
memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring credit-card offers of low ``teaser rates'' to  
prominently disclose when those rates expire and how costly 
repayment can be if only minimum monthly payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the Securities and Exchange Commission budget by  
$16.5 million in the coming fiscal year to boost the surveillance 
and prosecution of fraud in stock market and other financial 
transactions over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Kendall Calls `5-0-5-0' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Kendall's ``5-0-5-0'' is one of the most  
unusual batting lines in a box score. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's performance Monday night against San Francisco marked  
only the eighth time since 1970 a major league player had at least 
five hits in a game without scoring or driving a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday, the last player to do it was Jeff Blauser of  
Atlanta on June 10, 1996, against the New York Mets. The last 
Pirates player to do it was Matty Alou against Hall of Famer 
pitcher Juan Marichal of the Giants on Aug. 19, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kent of the Giants also had five hits Monday, but he had  
five RBIs and scored twice while becoming the 19th player in 
franchise history to hit for the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' 9-8 win was only their second victory in the last  
92 games they trailed entering the ninth inning. The Pirates, who 
trailed 8-5, hadn't erased a three-run deficit in the ninth inning 
since July 22, 1993, when they trailed 7-4 before scoring four 
times to beat the Atlanta Braves 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time NL players on opposing teams had five hits  
in a nine-inning game since Johnny Bench of the Reds went 5-for-6 
and Deron Johnson of the Philadelphia Phillies was 5-for-6 in a 
19-17 Cincinnati victory on Aug. 3, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said it might have been the Pirates' most exciting game  
since the 10-inning no-hitter by Cordova and Ricardo Rincon against 
the Houston Astros in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the best I've ever played in,'' he said. ``More  
than anything else, it gives us a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It lets you know you have guys who can get big hits for you,''  
Pirates manager Gene Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates already have won four times in their final at-bat;  
they had only eight such victories last season.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Survivors Recall the Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The churning charcoal-gray clouds bunching  
on the southwestern Oklahoma horizon don't look that ominous to Don 
McGee as he wraps up his day at the Lawton Police Department and 
heads for his part-time security shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see the wall cloud to the north with little tails  
hanging out of it,'' McGee says. ``Cars stopped to watch it. It 
caused a little traffic jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what was kicking up as a typical afternoon thunderstorm was  
about to explode into a series of vicious tornadoes, some with 
funnels half a mile wide, that would chop a path of death and 
indescribable destruction 60 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst in anyone's memory,'' Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk  
Humphreys says while surveying blocks of destroyed homes in the 
south end of the city Tuesday. ``I've never been afraid of a 
tornado until last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Forecaster Cheryl Sharp is on a team of National Weather Service  
forecasters and meteorologists in Norman, Okla., that's tracking 
the monster storm system as it emerges from a springtime collision 
of cold air from the north and warm, moist air from the south. 
</P>
<P>
	The first storms show up on radar near Lawton about 4 p.m., Ms.  
Sharp says. The weather service puts out its first thunderstorm 
warning -- covering Comanche County in southwestern Oklahoma -- 15 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	But the winds swiftly rise to howls, and fierce clouds whirl  
high over Comanche and Grady counties. Barely half an hour later, 
at 4:47 p.m., the service issues the day's first tornado warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``From then on, there was just chaos,'' Ms. Sharp says. ``It was  
very busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 20 hours, the weather service issues 174 warnings  
covering dozens of Oklahoma counties. They trace a diagonal line 
straight toward the state's northeastern corner. The enormous 
system eventually spits out as many as four dozen tornadoes before 
it spends itself. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City television stations go live as soon as the  
twisters form and, using helicopters, ground spotters and 
sophisticated radar, follow their ferocious dance across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The main storm forms near Chickasha, about 45 miles to the  
southwest. It skips across the flat Oklahoma countryside, toppling 
trees, power lines, outbuildings and cars until it rips into south 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at home,'' says Chickasha police Capt. Lynn Williams.  
``It started moving toward this direction. It looked like it was 
going to miss town. But I took the family over to the shelter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funnel is spotted about 5:30 p.m. and hits the municipal  
airport on the edge of town 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two hangars are damaged pretty bad,'' Williams says.  
As many as 20 light aircraft are mangled. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tornado stays several miles west and northwest of the  
most populated part of town, Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of bypassed us,'' he says. ``We got extremely lucky.''  
</P>
<P>
	Even so, 11 die in Bridge Creek, a tiny community 20 miles to  
the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Just south of the capital, at 6:40 p.m., Wendy Knapp is getting  
her son ready for T-ball practice. She doesn't know the National 
Weather Service is tracking a huge twister lumbering northwest and 
has just sent a tornado warning for McClain and Cleveland counties. 
</P>
<P>
	She and other parents have just arrived at the coach's home when  
the funnel cloud comes into view. She turns around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an eerie feeling that I should go home,'' says Ms.  
Knapp, a Red Cross volunteer at an evacuation shelter in Newcastle. 
``They made fun of me, but I was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in several of them in my lifetime. But this was a  
big one. This did more damage than I've ever seen in my life. There 
are dead cattle in people's yards, trees, debris. Grass was ripped 
up. At some homes, the foundations were ripped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone. It looks like the Murrah bombing.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At 6:51, the National Weather Service issues a severe  
thunderstorm warning for Oklahoma City environs. It upgrades to a 
tornado warning -- minutes before the twister hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just standing there watching the weather on TV'' when  
the forecasters predict a direct hit on suburban Moore, says Lee 
Ann Richardson. With heavy rain pounding her house, she rushes her 
family and pets into the storm cellar. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few minutes, they hear only silence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We opened up and everything was gone,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	A block away, the storm blows over Les Miller's house at 7:20.  
He emerges to unimaginable devastation almost everywhere he can 
see. Splintered beams and siding, shredded books and photo albums, 
children's toys, roofing tiles, kitchen pots and pans, remnants of 
belongings no longer recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' Miller says.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just destroyed the whole town,'' says Ralph Reed, who was  
rescued from the wreckage of his house in Moore. ``I mean it's just 
completely gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks further east, Terry Tamadge, a teacher at Westmoore  
High School, recounts Tuesday how he and his wife, Mimi, and their 
young daughter huddled together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got under the stairwell and listened to the house leave,''  
Tamadge says. 
</P>
<P>
	A clock still fixed to a wall is stopped at 7:21. The roof is  
gone; everything inside is wet and muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're lucky,'' Tamadge says. ``We've still got walls  
standing.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Question AOL Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Searching for damaging testimony to use during  
the next phase of its antitrust trial, lawyers for Microsoft Corp. 
will question two rival software executives from America Online 
Inc. this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition of Barry Schuler, president of AOL's interactive  
services division, was scheduled to begin today. AOL Chairman Steve 
Case will be questioned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, reporters will be allowed to attend at  
least part of the interviews with Schuler and Case because of an 
obscure 1913 law covering antitrust depositions, which are normally 
conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson previously decided  
to allow Microsoft -- in the middle of its antitrust trial -- to 
begin gathering evidence about the implications of AOL's recent 
$9.9 billion purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler, 45, is the leader of the transition team charged with  
merging Netscape's operations into AOL's. He also oversees the 
company's plans to offer its service on a variety of computer 
devices, its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, with nearly 17 million subscribers, is the world's largest  
Internet provider. Netscape produces successful Web browsing 
software and owns Netcenter, one of the most popular sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that Netscape's sale shows that competition  
in the high-tech industry is healthy enough that government 
intervention is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the sale was announced last November, the judge  
suggested that there ``might be a very significant change in the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is currently in a lengthy recess and not expected to  
resume until later this month.

<HEADLINE>  UConn's Hamilton Headed to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- All-American Richard Hamilton, who helped  
the University of Connecticut men's team to its first national 
championship, will skip his senior season and enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who averaged a team-leading 21.5 points per game this  
season, announced his decision Tuesday, just short of a month after 
teammate Khalid El-Amin said he would return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton was voted the outstanding player in the Final Four,  
averaging 26 points and six rebounds per game as Connecticut upset 
Duke 77-74 for the NCAA tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-6 forward, Hamilton was the third player in the Big  
East's 20-year history to win the player of the year at least 
twice. Chris Mullin of St. John's won in 1983, '84 and '85; Patrick 
Ewing of Georgetown shared the award in '84 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton won the award in 1998 and shared it this year with  
Miami forward Tim James. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton helped UConn to a 25-2 record this year and the  
school's fifth Big East Conference title in the last six regular 
seasons. The Huskies were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 21, contemplated turning professional after his  
sophomore year, but stayed in school in hopes of winning a national 
title. He said winning the title was a key factor in his decision 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hadn't won the national championship, to be honest with  
you, I might have come back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said he supported Hamilton's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it as a graduation date for Rip; he graduated from  
our basketball program,'' said Calhoun, using Hamilton's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who came to Connecticut from Northeastern in 1986, said  
Hamilton was the best scorer he had ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said he would try to continue his studies in order to  
earn his college degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten UConn players have been drafted or played in the NBA in the  
last 10 years. Hamilton is the third to leave school early to play 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is considered a lottery pick in the NBA draft, probably  
among the first 10 players to be chosen, because of his ability to 
score off the drive and play defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton leaves UConn as the school's second-highest all time  
scorer, with 2,036 points. Chris Smith scored 2,145 from 1988-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's 19.8 points per game is third in school history,  
behind Wes Bialosuknia (1965-67, 23.6 ppg) and Walt Dropo (1942-47, 
20.7), who went on to play major league baseball with the Boston 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is, when he left the college basketball floor with  
his teammates at Tropicana Field, there wasn't a better player in 
college basketball,'' Calhoun said. ``That's a pretty good way to 
end your college career.''

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Soccer Team To Train in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- To prepare for their first appearance in the  
Women's World Cup, the North Korean team will train in northern New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Michael F. Coyne, president of Evergreen Sports  
Management in Cleveland, said Tuesday the squad will arrive the 
first week of June and stay at the Legends Resort and County Club 
in Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not yet know if the team would have any public  
appearances in New Jersey, but said it might stage an exhibition 
and youth clinic in Canton, Ohio, before continuing west for its 
first game, June 20 against Nigeria in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The team may want to limit its exposure for a competitive  
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really knows that much about the team,'' Coyne said.  
``They haven't played that much outside of North Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-nation tournament begins June 19 with two games at Giants  
Stadium East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Korean delegation includes 28 players and coaches,  
plus several others Coyne believes are ``trainers and 
administrative people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not think the North Koreans were bringing security  
officers to prevent defections from the closed Communist society. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've never expressed a concern about that,'' Coyne said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although many in the delegation are probably making their first  
trip to the United States, Coyne said, ``They have not expressed a 
desire to do any touring at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sussex County site was chosen at the suggestion of the  
Korean Businessmen's Federation of America, which knew Coyne from 
his work with Michael Ri, a 7-foot-9 North Korean basketball player 
who played recently in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	A federation representative was not available for comment  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey has a sizeable Korean population, concentrated in the  
north in Bergen County.

<HEADLINE> MLS Yellow Card Flurry Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a matter of styles, not disrespect for  
American soccer, that led Scottish referee Stuart Dougal to issue 
11 yellow cards and one red in Saturday night's MLS match between 
Chicago and D.C. United. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some referees have the forte of being good player managers,  
others go to the card right away,'' MLS vice president of game 
operations Joe Machnik said Tuesday. ``The fact that Mr. Dougal 
issued 10 cards I think showed he is a very technical referee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a lack of respect at all.''  
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the opinion of D.C. United president and general  
manager Kevin Payne, who verbally lashed out at Dougal and MLS 
after his team's 3-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why we need to go 4,000 miles to get a  
referee that poor,'' Payne said. ``This referee clearly has no 
respect for our league and he should be sent home. I'll be happy to 
pay for his flight home. ... If he ever did this in Scotland, he'd 
never referee again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those remarks and others earned Payne a $15,000 fine from MLS  
commissioner Doug Logan, who called the comments ``intemperate'' 
and ``inappropriate''. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, who said he spoke to Payne by telephone on Tuesday and  
received e-mail from the D.C. United boss, said Washington's 
executive apologized and was remorseful for his comments and 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan did not say whether he would consider reducing the fine.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game was the last of three officiated by Dougal, the  
fourth foreign official to come to the United States to referee 
games as part of MLS' referee exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by some foreign players and officials not affiliated  
with MLS have convinced several MLS officials that many outside the 
United States don't respect the league or its level of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago coach Bob Bradley questioned the red card issued to D.C.  
United defender Brian Kamler in the 16th minute. While praising the 
exchange program, Bradley chided Dougal by saying Saturday's game 
wasn't its best example. 
</P>
<P>
	In his three games, Dougal, a referee since 1985 and a FIFA  
referee in 1996, issued 26 yellow cards plus the one red. Twice in 
Saturday's match he yellow-carded a player twice, resulting in 
their ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	His average of 8.6 yellow cards a game is nearly triple the MLS  
number of cautions per game (3.16) over its first three-plus 
seasons.

	``Yes, it is not the Bundesliga, it's not the Serie A, but the  
foreign referees have a lot of respect for MLS, especially for the 
technical ability of the players,'' U.S. Soccer Federation director 
of officials Esse Baharmast said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. federation on Tuesday issued a statement distancing  
itself from Payne, a member of the federation's board of directors. 
The federation expressed support for the exchange program, which 
also has seen MLS referees officiate in Spain, Japan and the United 
Arab Emirates, with another trip to Scotland scheduled for later 
this year.

<P>
	``No doubt, part of the challenge of starting a league was that  
this was their game, not our game,'' Logan said. ``There is a 
significant amount of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes on, we're gaining more and more respect. Part of  
the growth process is gaining respect. I don't see a lack of 
respect from (the foreign) referees. The comments we're getting 
have been pretty complimentary.''

<HEADLINE> World Hockey Stars Selanne, Yashin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMAR, Norway (AP) -- After quick exits in the NHL playoffs,  
Teemu Selanne and Alexei Yashin are making the most of extended 
playing time in the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has rediscovered his touch in Norway, scoring twice to  
lead Russia to a crucial 4-1 victory over newcomer Ukraine on 
Tuesday. Selanne was clearly still on a roll, scoring for Finland 
in his opening match against Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin, who battled for the NHL scoring lead all season, was  
held scoreless as Buffalo swept Ottawa from the first round of the 
Stanley Cup playoffs, He's had no trouble finding the back of the 
net in the international tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful Russian has three goals in two games, leaving him  
just one short of the tournament's scoring lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne, the NHL's leader this season with 47 goals for Anaheim,  
made his first appearance in the tournament despite having arrived 
on Sunday, after more than 15 hours in a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first few games may be a bit difficult and it may take a  
couple of matches to get back in the swing,'' said a modest 
Selanne, making his third world championships appearance. ``But as 
the tournament goes on I'm sure I'll improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Selanne has anything to prove or improve.  
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the newly established Maurice Richard trophy for the  
NHL's top scorer, Selanne has a long record of scoring brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992-93, with the Winnipeg Jets (now the Phoenix Coyotes),  
Selanne and Alexander Mogilny became the NHL's top-scoring rookies 
with 76 goals. In 1997-98, Selanne shared the top spot on the NHL's 
scoring list with Peter Bondra with 52 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Selanne's goal record is indisputably brilliant, it  
has never led to a major title or trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NHL, Selanne has never won a Stanley Cup, nor has he won  
an Olympic or world championship title with Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the 28-year-old star came was in the Winter Games  
last year in Nagano, Japan, when Finland took the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I weren't interested in playing ... or  
winning,'' said Selanne, who scored six goals in the 1991 worlds in 
Finland and five goals in 1996 in Austria. ``I wanted to come 
because in my career I've won almost nothing and maybe I can change 
that here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's schedule had the United States playing the Czech  
Republic -- both teams are 2-0 and already qualified for the next 
round; Canada vs. Italy; Japan vs. Austria; and Norway vs. 
Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two NHL stars will have a scoring showdown Thursday when  
Russia and Finland close out the round-robin portion of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	While Finland has already secured its place in the quarterfinal  
round, Russia's qualification hinges on the outcome of Thursday's 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid,'' laughed Yashin, who scored 44 goals in the  
NHL regular season. ``Teemu is a very good friend of mine. We 
respect each other. He's a great scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably going to be one of the most important matches  
for Russia and we'll need to prepare ourselves. They have a very 
good team with a lot of superstars from the NHL and they'll be a 
challenge for us. But we're not scared.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Aid for Tornado Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal emergency and Red Cross workers are on  
the scene, with more on the way, to assist the victims of the 
tornadoes in Kansas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency ``started sending people  
once it became obvious how serious it is,'' Deputy Director Mike 
Walker said. Director James Lee Witt is there and FEMA will 
coordinate the work of 27 federal agencies and the Red Cross, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Darren Irby said the Red Cross has set up 10 emergency  
shelters in Oklahoma and three in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also sent a dozen emergency response vehicles to provide  
food for tornado victims in the two states. Each of these vehicles 
is capable of providing 5,000 meals a day, Irby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross is also sending damage assessment teams who go  
street by street to determine how large the recovery operation is 
going to be and what additional help is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said FEMA has deployed teams to assist victims obtain  
temporary housing and begin work toward long-term recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Small Business Administration will provide both business and  
home loans, he said, and the Public Health Service is sending a 
portable morgue from Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department will airlift needed supplies, Walker  
said, such as food and bottled water.

<HEADLINE> IOC Clears Kim, but Not Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders closed the case  
Tuesday against the highest-ranking official caught in the Salt 
Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's executive board said it  
had ``no new element'' of evidence to justify further action 
against Kim Un-yong, a board member and international sports 
power-broker. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board said there was enough new information to extend  
its investigation of a second leading member, Australia's Phil 
Coles, who like Kim had received a severe warning from an earlier 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	It appointed a three-member panel to report its latest findings  
by June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think and I hope this case will be settled'' by the IOC's  
June session in Seoul, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. 
Coles could face expulsion from the IOC if the investigation finds 
he violated more rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an executive board member from Australia, said a  
decision could come sooner than that, adding that Coles ``may well 
be'' called to appear before the new panel, made up of board 
members Keba Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz and Marc Hodler. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim had risked expulsion if it was proved he knew that Salt Lake  
bidders helped pay for his son's salary at a telecommunications 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board charged Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz of the United  
States and Switzerland's Marc Hodler with conducting further 
investigations of the Coles case. 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving new information on Kim, the IOC's top  
officials decided that ``no new element at present justifies going 
beyond the severe warning,'' IOC vice president Keba Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was cited originally for accepting travel and  
accommodation perks from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	He was put under renewed scrutiny after his ex-wife claimed that  
representatives of Athens' unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics 
gave the couple jewelry worth $6,000. He consistently denied the 
claims and refused to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence emerged Tuesday, when Australian media said that  
Salt Lake City had obtained confidential briefing notes by Coles on 
how other IOC members could be trusted to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said this all along, there are certain people out to  
get me and I am going to fight them,'' said Coles, who said he had 
made weekly and sometimes daily reports on IOC members during 
Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent that back to the Sydney office and that is the last I  
heard of it,'' he said. Up to 40 people would have had access to 
the documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the allegations will be subject to ``a single investigation  
and a single decision,'' Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had profiles done on IOC members before ad nauseam,''  
Gosper said. ``I think the real issue here is how these files ended 
up in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to comment on what fate might await Coles.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act with facts, not with information,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As well as completion of the Coles investigation, June will see  
the first meeting of the IOC 2000 commission, whose 80 members were 
unveiled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform panel, which Samaranch originally said would have  
20-24 members, was set up in March to help the committee rebuild 
after the biggest scandal in its 105-year history. Ten IOC members 
have resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will be supervised by its own 26-member executive  
board, 13 of whose members are from outside the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	They include former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; 1984 Los  
Angeles Games organizer Peter Ueberroth; U.S. Olympic Committee 
president Bill Hybl; Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli; and 
former U.N. Secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the main panel's membership -- including 44 IOC  
members -- had become so large ``because we consider that we need 
many, many opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It contains 26 present and former Olympic athletes, 10 of whom  
competed in the Atlanta and Nagano games. Among them are Ukrainian 
pole vaulter Sergei Bubka, Czech javelin thrower Jan Zelezny, and 
Canadian track star Charmaine Crooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is to study IOC restructuring, including how members  
are appointed, age and term limits, and changes to the host city 
selection process.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Asks U.S. To Pay for Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan asked the United States on Tuesday  
to compensate everyone affected by a U.S. attack that destroyed a 
pharmaceutical plant in August. 
</P>
<P>
	It also urged the lifting of sanctions imposed on the African  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sudanese requests came a day after the U.S. Justice and  
Treasury departments decided to unfreeze the assets of the owner of 
Sudan's El Shifa factory, Saudi-Sudanese businessman Salah Idris. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington bombed the factory in August 1998, maintaining it was  
producing chemical weapons agents. The United States also alleges 
that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi billionaire accused of bankrolling 
last year's deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania, had links to the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Nimir, a minister of state for foreign affairs, said the  
decision to lift the freeze on Idris' assets was ``proof against 
the allegations'' that El Shifa was producing chemical weapons. It 
also ``showed the mistake of the aggression,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Sudan News Agency, SUNA, quoted Nimir as expressing  
hope that the Clinton administration would compensate all those 
affected ``as well as assist Sudan with realizing peace in the 
county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We ``hope that America would reconsider all the measures it has  
taken against Sudan, annulling all forms of political, trade and 
economic sanctions,'' SUNA quoted Nimir as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not say how much compensation Sudan would like to  
receive. The United States has not backed away from its assertion 
that the plant produced chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has  
imposed trade and other economic sanctions. It has withdrawn its 
diplomats from Khartoum for security reasons, but maintains 
diplomatic contacts from Kenya and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. decision to release the freeze on Idris' U.S. bank  
accounts came the day the government was scheduled to answer a 
civil suit filed by Idris on Feb. 26. The suit demanded the release 
of more than $24 million in bank deposits at the Bank of America, 
which were frozen because U.S. officials suspected Idris was 
involved in terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Idris' attorney said he believed the government backed down  
because it had no evidence the plant was involved in chemical 
weapons production.

<HEADLINE> Kodak CFO Harry Kavetas Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. chief financial officer  
Harry L. Kavetas, who helped engineer nearly 20,000 job cuts at the 
photography company to counter Japanese gains in the U.S. market, 
died Tuesday at age 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavetas suffered an apparent heart attack at his home.  
</P>
<P>
	A longtime executive at International Business Machines Corp.,  
Kavetas took a brief early retirement at the end of 1993 after 
being passed over for a top post by new IBM chief executive Louis 
V. Gerstner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired as Kodak's chief financial officer in February  
1994, filling a post left vacant since an avid cost-cutter, 
Christopher Steffen, quit nine months earlier in a 
headline-grabbing dispute over financial policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffen's departure led to a management shakeup and a new  
strategy to slash overhead by laying off 10,000 workers. Kavetas 
took over with much of that new policy in place, which was aimed at 
defending Kodak's mainstay photographic businesses from assault by 
Japanese nemesis Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, Kavetas and his boss, CEO George Fisher, resorted  
to even deeper cutbacks when Fuji slashed film prices in the United 
States and grabbed market share on Kodak's dominant home turf. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, Kodak expects to trim more than $1  
billion in costs by eliminating almost one-fifth of its worldwide 
payroll of 100,500. The company has seen a sharp rebound in sales 
and profits in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harry believed in Kodak and he was absolutely dedicated to his  
role and to the revitalization of the company,'' Fisher said. ``We 
will miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kavetas joined IBM in 1961, was appointed chief of IBM Credit in  
1986 and was elected an IBM vice president in 1989. Under his 
management, IBM Credit grew from $5.7 billion in assets and $118 
million in profits to $10 billion in assets and $220 million in 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kodak, Kavetas was appointed executive vice president in  
September 1994 and elected to the board of directors in May 1997. 
Kodak named his deputy, Jesse J. Greene Jr., as acting chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Springfield, Ill., Kavetas held a bachelor's degree  
in finance and economics from the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his widow, Sue; three children, Betsy, Kathy  
and James; and three grandchildren, Jimmy, William and Ellen.

<HEADLINE> Gumbel Set To Return to Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel's farewell to morning television  
was apparently short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after leaving as co-host of NBC's ``Today'' show,  
Gumbel is expected to take the helm of CBS's last-place morning 
show, ``This Morning.'' The network plans to announce the decision 
at a news conference later today, network executives speaking on 
condition of anonymity said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not likely to reveal a co-host for Gumbel. Network  
executives have reportedly considered ABC's Elizabeth Vargas and 
Deborah Norville, who was briefly Gumbel's partner on ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has largely been off the air since the cancellation of  
his newsmagazine, ``Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel,'' last year. He 
left ``Today'' after 15 years in 1997 to sign a lucrative contract 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Ed Hookstratten, did not immediately return a call  
for comment on Monday. CBS would not discuss its news conference 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' has run a consistent third in the ratings  
behind ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The ABC show 
raised the stakes in the morning news competition earlier this year 
when it brought Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer in as temporary 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also intends to unveil plans today to build a new storefront  
studio for ``This Morning.'' It will be similar to the Rockefeller 
Center studio used by ``Today,'' the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for ``Today'' blossomed after it began televising from a  
studio with a window to the street in Rockefeller Center. ABC 
subsequently began building a Times Square studio, and CBS hopes to 
use space on Fifth Avenue near Central Park. It is expected to be 
ready in late fall or early winter.

<P>
	More punishing severe thunderstorms -- including a few strong  
tornadoes -- were expected over parts of the South again today while 
rain clouds hung over most of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Low pressure was expected to continue drifting across New  
England, spiraling moisture and clouds from the Northwest to 
Pennsylvania. Temperatures were forecast to dip below seasonable 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
	To the west, a cloudy system moving over the central Plains was  
forecast to head into the western Great Lakes and along the 
Mississippi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain, hail and possible thunderstorms were expected across areas  
of Wisconsin to Louisiana, and filling into areas of Michigan, the 
Mississippi Valley and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front extending from the Dakotas through northern Texas  
was forecast to head eastward, pushing thunderstorms into the 
Dakotas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several powerful tornadoes roared across Oklahoma and Kansas on  
Monday, killing dozens of people and bringing destruction to cities 
and small communities alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers were forecast across much of the north-central  
states again today. The western areas of Kansas through west Texas 
could escape the worst rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, several lines of storms were moving through the  
Dallas-Fort Worth area. Numerous power outages were reported as 
high winds toppled power lines and lightning struck lines. 
</P>
<P>
	A trough of low pressure was forecast to continue to hang along  
the Rocky Mountain states through the upper Southwest. Cloudy skies 
were dawning over Idaho and Montana, through Wyoming, Colorado, and 
upper New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pacific Northwest, to northern California, partly to  
mostly cloudy skies were expected. Rain was likely in Washington 
and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature in the continental United States on  
Monday was 82 degrees at Kingsville, Texas. The low was 28 degrees 
at Mullen Pass, Idaho, and Berlin, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast to reach the 50s along the Pacific  
Northwest, the Rockies, Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas; the 60s and 
70s from New York through Pennsylvania to New England, and the 
Great Lakes through the Ohio Valley; the 80s in the Southeast, 
Arizona, California and Oklahoma; and some 90s in southern portions 
of Texas.

<HEADLINE> CBS Brings Gumbel to Mornings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel's farewell to morning television  
was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS announced today that Gumbel, host of the ``Today'' show on  
NBC for 15 years before leaving in 1997, will return to the time 
slot this fall, teaming with a former ``Today'' executive and 
broadcasting from a new storefront studio in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel will face the challenge of lifting a show that has been  
the doormat for decades in the morning TV ratings race. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Friedman, who was executive producer of ``Today'' twice  
during Gumbel's time as host, will run the revamped ``This 
Morning'' when it debuts in November. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is also taking a leaf from NBC in announcing plans to build  
a studio in the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in 
Manhattan. ``Today'' assumed its dominant role in the ratings when 
it opened a studio with windows to the street at Rockefeller Center 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I never planned on making a return to morning  
television, I think it's where I belong and I know it's where I'm 
most comfortable,'' Gumbel said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel signed a $5 million contract with CBS two years ago but  
was a man without a job when his newsmagazine, ``Public Eye with 
Bryant Gumbel,'' was canceled last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' continues to dominate in the increasingly lucrative  
morning television race, and ABC appeared to stop its decline in 
January when it named Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer as co-hosts. 
ABC is building a new studio for ``Good Morning America'' in Times 
Square, but it's not clear how long Gibson and Sawyer will continue 
on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS did not name a co-anchor for Gumbel. Network executives have  
reportedly considered ABC's Elizabeth Vargas and Deborah Norville, 
who was briefly Gumbel's partner on ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on the future of Jane Robelot and Mark McEwen,  
the current hosts of ``This Morning.'' Al Berman, the show's 
current executive producer, will keep his job but work for 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not naive about the difficulty of the challenges that lie  
ahead, but I am enthused about the extent of CBS's commitment to 
what Steve and I want to do and optimistic about our future,'' 
Gumbel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman has been manager of CBS's New York City station for the  
past two years. He was executive producer of ``Today'' from 1979 to 
1987 and again from 1993 to 1995.

<HEADLINE> Debris, Despair Result of Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Where houses once stood, there was nothing  
but garbage. Trees were stripped bare or ripped from the ground. 
Devastation stretched as far as the eye could see. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Schantz clung to her young daughter in the front yard  
of where their home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just bought this house,'' said Mrs. Schantz, whose family  
wasn't home when the storm hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' said LeeAnn Richardson of her house on Regency  
Street. ``We were just standing in there and looking at the weather 
on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While others wandered stunned, one woman yelled, ``Oh my God! Oh  
my God!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson and 15 others -- family, friends, neighbors -- hid  
in a storm cellar as the tornado approached Monday evening. All 
escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened up and everything was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rows and rows of houses simply vanished but for their cement  
foundations. Trucks were overturned, cars became twisted metal 
heaps. Natural gas leaked and downed power lines lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Meyers tried to hide from the storm under a mattress,  
but it didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got hit four or five times on my head by something. I've  
lost a lot of blood,'' she said as she was treated by a Red Cross 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Melvin, had an injured right knee and left wrist  
and bled from the head. He said he hid under a different mattress 
that was sucked out of the house when the roof blew off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first burst, it took it out of there. Part of the ceiling  
fell in on me and shaded me,'' Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors hid in cellars or other enclosed areas. Loretta and  
Theresa Jones took shelter in a closet of their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the closet and calling in the name of Jesus,''  
Theresa Jones said. ``We heard it coming and -- whoa, whoa, Jesus -- 
we called on his name and I felt his arms come around us and saved 
us from that tornado. And I thank God for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the wreckage of Oklahoma City's suburbs, survivors looked  
for their missing loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	At Del City High School's John Smith Field House, a woman bolted  
toward a chalkboard holding the names of those lost and found, then 
froze with tears in her eyes as she found no familiar names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean they're gone, honey,'' a volunteer said,  
trying to comfort her. 
</P>
<P>
	The sobbing woman added her family's names to the list of  
missing, then was guided to a seat on the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to her sat Floy Hopper, 76, and her 78-year-old husband,  
John, who were pulled from their bathroom by rescue workers. Mrs. 
Hopper clutched a flashlight and cellular phone, all they salvaged 
from the wreckage of their four-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see anything,'' said her husband, whose glasses were  
lost in the chaos. ``We have what we got on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Hillcrest Hospital in Oklahoma City, beds were set up in the  
cafeteria to help treat the more than 150 injured who were taken 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible incident,'' said Sharla Findley,  
director of community relations. ``It's the worst we've ever seen 
at the hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Stewards To Hold Valhol Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Jockey Billy Patin is expected to  
testify Wednesday when the state racing stewards conduct a hearing 
into allegations that the rider carried an illegal electrical 
device when he rode Arkansas Derby winner Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very surprised if he didn't testify,'' said Byron  
Freeland, attorney for the state Racing Commission. ``This is a 
civil matter. If you don't defend yourself, that could be used 
against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol scored the first victory of his career when he won the  
Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days later, Oaklawn Park President Charles J. Cella said  
the track had evidence that Patin ``may have been in possession of 
an electrical device during the race.'' He said officials first 
learned about the possibility shortly after the race became 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Racing Commission ordered the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse and arranged for an investigation. 
Eventually, Valhol's owner James D. Jackson went to court and a 
judge released the $300,000 first-place money. That check enabled 
Valhol to secure a spot in Saturday's Kentucky Derb in which the 
gelding finished 15th in the 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeland said Jackson and trainer Dallas Keen had been sent  
notices about Wednesday's hearing. At the least, he said, they will 
be represented by attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Simpson, an attorney for Oaklawn, will present the evidence  
against Patin. J. Minos Simon of Lafayette, La., represents Patin. 
Each side will be allowed to cross-examine any witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My perception is that Simon has lots of arguments,'' Freeland  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon previously raised the question about whether racing  
officials who ban an electrical device could be interfering with a 
rider's right to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas' rules of racing saying, ``No electrical or mechanical  
device or other expedient designed to increase or decrease the 
speed of a horse, or that would tend to do so, other than the 
ordinary whip, shall be possessed by anyone or applied by anyone to 
a horse at any time on the grounds of a franchise holder during a 
matter whether in a race or otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon said he had been told that an electrical device does not  
stimulate a horse as much as a whip. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that should prove out to be the case, there is no  
reasonable basis for a ban on such a device,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn's evidence is almost certain to include a videotape that  
shows something falling from the area of Patin's left hand and 
Valhol's left shoulder shortly after the finish of the Arkansas 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was the third of Valhol's career. He paid $62.80 to  
win.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Firm Chief Admits Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of a Wall Street currency trading  
firm has pleaded guilty to federal charges that he defrauded 
investors of more than $1 million by pocketing their money rather 
than investing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Fulton Roberts, 31, of Manhattan, admitted to U.S. District  
Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck Monday that he lied to customers of 
his company, Fulton Whitney Inc., telling them he would invest 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he spent it on himself and on payroll and expenses for  
his business, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who was arrested a year ago, pleaded guilty to one  
count of mail fraud, which could carry a sentence of up to five 
years in prison and a fine of up to $2 million, along with 
mandatory restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be sentenced on Aug. 3.

<HEADLINE> Economic Indicators Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and signs of a backlog in  
the delivery of orders by vendors pushed a key gauge of future 
economic activity higher for the sixth straight month in March, 
signaling continued strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 
107.3 in March, up from a revised level of 107.2 in February. The 
results were in line with economist expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a normal-size increase for a single month,'' said  
Michael Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the 
Conference Board. ``But because the leading index is up 1.6 percent 
since September of last year, there is a lot of confidence that 
this expansion will continue at a robust pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The index of leading indicators is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	A backlog in delivery of goods indicates increased demand,  
helping to drive the index higher, Boldin said. A decline in 
building permits and consumer expectations limited the gain, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 128.58 to  
10,886.11, one day after charging ahead 225 points to its first 
close above 11,000. Broader stock indicators gave ground after a 
mixed morning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 ended down 22.63 at 
1,332.00, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 50.46 to 2,485.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board also reported that its coincident  
indicators, which measure current activity, rose 0.2 percent and 
the lagging index, which measures the economy's past performance, 
rose 0.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the board said the three index components show a  
healthy economy that will continue to expand through at least late 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned, with figures from past years revised.

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Front-Runner in Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three Midwestern cities where incumbents are not running also  
held mayoral races. 
</P>
<P>
	With 25 percent of precincts reporting, Webb, a Democrat, had  
picked up 82 percent of the vote and became the first Denver mayor 
to win without a runoff since 1979. His three opponents had 
struggled to raise money, and two-thirds of voters polled three 
weeks ago could not name one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, president-elect of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said he  
hoped to use his third term to continue increasing public safety, 
protecting parks and open space and creating economic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	In early returns in Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman led a field of nine  
candidates in a nonpartisan election. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 59, for years was called the mouthpiece for the mob  
because of his vigorous defense of people like Lansky and Tony 
``the Ant'' Spilotro, the gangster who legend has it put a rival's 
head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out. Goodman played 
himself in Martin Scorsese's ``Casino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman campaigned as a populist and defender of the defenseless  
who would break up the city's good-old-boy network. 
</P>
<P>
	One rival, Councilman Arnie Adamsen, said electing Goodman would  
set the city's reputation back 50 years. But Adamsen and developer 
Mark Fine, another leading candidate, also spent much of their time 
attacking each other, to Goodman's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will  
meet in a runoff June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most expensive mayoral race ever in Lincoln, Neb.,  
former state Sen. Don Wesely, a Democrat, defeated Republican City 
Councilwoman Cindy Johnson. Wesely succeeds Republican Mike 
Johanns, who was elected governor last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesely and Ms. Johnson spent a combined $420,000 on the  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates made crime-fighting a major issue in Indianapolis,  
which has seen record-breaking numbers of homicides the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are trying to take over the mayor's post for the first  
time in 30 years, and on Tuesday they nominated Bart Peterson, a 
developer who was former Gov. Evan Bayh's chief of staff. Indiana 
Secretary of State Sue Anne Gilroy was selected as the GOP nominee 
to succeed Stephen Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, Ohio, will have its first female mayor or first black  
mayor after the November election. Republican Dorothy Teater and 
Democrat Michael Coleman, who is black, were the top two finishers 
in a three-way nonpartisan primary on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Castro Hails `Historic' Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Beaming President Fidel Castro and hundreds of  
screaming children greeted the victorious Cuban baseball team as it 
returned home Tuesday after beating the Orioles in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the festivities, there was no hint that at least one of the  
delegation members, a well-known retired pitcher, had reportedly 
stayed behind in Baltimore and requested political asylum in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a truly historic event,'' Castro said during a  
lengthy speech recognizing the athletes on the steps of the 
University of Havana. ``For a long time we have wanted to measure 
the advances in our sport, to know what would happen if such a game 
was held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Cubans saw, he said, were first-class baseball players  
``with the spirits of lions, of tigers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of baseball fans crammed the streets leading into the  
university to greet the hometown heroes as they arrived from the 
airport in open Jeeps, waving at the crowd. The players dressed 
identically in light cotton shirts and ties, slacks and beige 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba! Cuba!'' the fans chanted, some waving the red, white and  
blue Cuban flag. 
</P>
<P>
	At the university, first baseman Omar Linares thanked Castro for  
his support for the game, a rematch after the Orioles defeated Cuba 
in Havana 3-2 on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear commander in chief, the mission you gave us has been  
completed,'' the smiling Linares said before hugging the leader. 
``Socialism or death! Patriotism or death! We will overcome!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier at the airport, the Cuban leader personally greeted  
Linares and Cuban umpire Cesar Valdes, who tackled an anti-Castro 
protester who ran onto the field with a political banner during the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	During a speech that stretched over three hours, Castro  
criticized sports agents who attempt to persuade Cuban athletes to 
defect and blasted the focus on money in American sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But he gave no indication that any of the more than 300 members  
of the Cuban delegation had stayed behind, even though Baltimore 
police said Rigoberto Herrera, a member of the Cuban delegation 
that attended the game, walked into a police station Tuesday and 
requested asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's name was also given by others as Rigoberto Herrera  
Betancourt and Rigoberto Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired pitcher named Rigoberto Betancourt, 54, a pitching  
coach from Havana, was a member of the Cuban delegation. A man who 
answered the phone at Cuba's Institute for Sports Tuesday afternoon 
said the government agency had no information about the reported 
defection. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro did not mention the pitcher, but criticized sports agents  
who make a living out of getting Cuban athletes to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban leader claimed Linares had been offered $40 million to  
join the major leagues, but turned it down. He did not say when the 
offer was made and did not provide any other details. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go around the world buying athletes, they go around  
buying scientists, and artists. It is very difficult to compete 
with that,'' Castro said. ``We have to fight against these attempts 
to buy off our athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro recognized a need to somehow better compensate Cuba's  
world-class athletes. ``What can we give our athletes?'' asked 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said money was not the entire answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``The flag cannot be sold. The homeland cannot be sold,'' he  
said. ``And the glory of these athletes is that they cannot be 
sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba beat the Baltimore Orioles 12-6 on Monday, despite rainy,  
cold weather and just a few month's practice with the wooden bats 
recently adopted to replace the country's traditional aluminum 
ones.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Shootings Death Toll Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian troops patrolled towns  
in a restive northwestern province today and the country's top 
commander promised an investigation one day after soldiers shot and 
killed as many as 23 villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting Monday in Pulo Rungkom village was one of the  
deadliest incidents in recent years in Aceh province, where the 
military has long been accused of human rights abuses during 
operations against a small band of separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's armed forces commander, Gen. Wiranto, said today  
there would be a thorough investigation of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came one month before nationwide parliamentary  
elections that are viewed as a test of Indonesia's transition to 
democracy following the downfall last year of authoritarian 
President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	However, separatists who want an Islamic state in Aceh have  
urged a boycott of the election. Many residents are bitter toward 
the central government, which they believe exploits the natural 
resources of the oil-rich province. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pulo Rungkom, the trouble started after hundreds of troops  
arrived to demand that residents release a soldier who had been 
abducted over the weekend. They were met by thousands of villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	After tense negotiations, the shooting began. Witnesses and  
reporters said soldiers fired on unarmed residents, including women 
and children. ``God is great!'' protesters shouted as they ran for 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The soldiers chased the crowds and fired at them from behind.  
They even fired inside a house where villagers who were trying to 
escape had run,'' one witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said today by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif disputed that  
account, saying civilians opened fire first and troops shot back in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mulya, head of the state hospital in the nearby city of  
Lhokseumawe, said today that 23 people died and more than 50 
injured people had been treated by his hospital alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those who were injured were trampled while trying to  
run away from the soldiers,'' he said, adding that many also had 
bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The military said 18 people died and 81 were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Many shops in Lhokseumawe, the site of anti-military riots in  
the past year, were closed today. Truckloads of police and soldiers 
drove through the streets of the city, 1,100 miles northwest of 
Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the military apologized for atrocities in Aceh and  
promised to hand some authority over security matters to community 
leaders. It appears now to have abandoned that approach.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cops Go on Trial in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five white police officers went on trial on  
civil rights charges Tuesday in the case of Abner Louima, a Haitian 
immigrant investigators say was sexually brutalized in a 
stationhouse bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 case, along with this year's police shooting of an  
unarmed African immigrant, has strained relations between the 
Police Department and the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, federal prosecutor Kenneth Thompson  
described in graphic detail how the defendants supposedly battered 
a handcuffed Louima inside a patrol car and then sodomized him in a 
bloody assault in a precinct bathroom in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense attorney countered that Louima had ``150 million  
reasons'' to lie about the incident -- a $150 million lawsuit 
against the city. Louima is represented by O.J. Simpson lawyers 
Johnnie Cochran Jr. and Barry Scheck in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Justin Volpe, 27, and three other officers are charged  
with assaulting Louima outside the precinct. And Volpe and Officer 
Charles Schwarz are charged in the attack inside the precinct 
bathroom, where Volpe allegedly stuck a broomstick into Louima's 
rectum and then jammed it into his mouth. A fifth officer is 
charged with covering up the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries that  
included a ruptured bladder and colon, prompting widespread 
demonstrations against police brutality in the city. He has 
recovered and is expected to be the government's star witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inside that bathroom, Abner Louima suffered more than a  
beating,'' Thompson told the jury of eight whites, three Hispanics 
and one black. ``Ladies and gentlemen, Abner Louima was tortured 
inside that bathroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Thompson, Volpe at one point warned Louima: ``If  
you make any noise, we kill you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said that Louima was picked up in a case of  
mistaken identity: Police wanted Louima's cousin, who had actually 
struck Volpe during a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone hurts Justin Volpe, he believes in hurting  
back,'' Thompson said. ``He was furious, and he wanted revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Volpe's lawyer, said the lawsuit gave Louima  
$150 million in incentives to ``cut the truth, to modify the truth, 
to in fact lie.'' He suggested another explanation for Louima's 
internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Those injuries were ``not consistent with a nonconsensual  
insertion of an object into his rectum,'' Kornberg said. Also, he 
said, there was evidence of another man's DNA mixed in with some of 
Louima's feces found in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson acknowledged to the jury that Louima lied initially  
when he claimed that the assaulting officers had taunted him by 
saying, ``It's Giuliani time.'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made his 
reputation as a law-and-order politician who made the city's 
streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That lie,'' Kornberg responded, ``was told to create  
divisiveness in the city of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Schwarz, 33, Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 35, are  
charged with violating Louima's civil rights by beating him after 
his arrest outside the nightclub. Prosecutors also allege that 
Schwarz held Louima down while Volpe rammed the stick into Louima's 
rectum and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' supervisor, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, is charged  
with helping cover up the attack. If convicted, Bellomo, Bruder and 
Wiese face up to 10 years in prison; Volpe and Schwarz could get 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter two face longer sentences because of the sexual  
nature of the bathroom attack.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses EU Report on Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are dismissing a report by  
European Union scientists Tuesday that contends a growth hormone in 
American beef may cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials must end the stalling and lift a ban on the hormone  
beef or face retaliation, a top trade official warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supposed new claims are nothing but misleading  
allegations,'' said Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on 
agricultural matters, calling the report a ``blatant attempt'' by 
the EU to delay abiding by its trade obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the EU does not lift this ban, we will retaliate this  
summer,'' Scher told a Senate subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the EU's Scientific Committee on  
Veterinary Measures said the hormone 17 beta-oestradiol -- one of 
six growth hormones in American beef -- ``has to be considered as a 
complete carcinogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It exerts both tumor initiating and tumor promoting effects,''  
the report said. ``In plain language, this means that even small 
additional doses of residues of this hormone in meat, arising from 
its use as a growth promoter in cattle, has an inherent risk of 
causing cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was inadequate data to make a definitive finding on other  
growth hormones used in U.S. beef, the scientific committee said. 
But it said exposure to small levels of residues in meat and meat 
products ``carries risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky said the EU had issued ``yet another misleading 
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It repeats the same unsubstantiated arguments that the EU has  
already made before the WTO (World Trade Organization) panel of 
experts, which were flatly rejected by the panel,'' they said in a 
joint statement. ``The issue is the EU's refusal to comply with the 
WTO rulings and its unwillingness to honor its international 
obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokesman Gerard Kiely countered Tuesday that the United  
States is wrong to criticize the report before reading the entire 
document, which will be made available later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unwise to dismiss scientific evidence. The United States  
should wait for the full report,'' Kiely said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to cattle to make them 
grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled a year ago that the EU ban on hormone-treated beef  
was illegal and must be lifted by May 13. It said the EU's ban was 
not supported by the proper risk analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, the U.S. has exported only hormone-free beef to the  
EU because of the ban. The U.S. industry has put the lost export 
sales at $500 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is threatening to impose 100 percent  
tariffs on more than $900 million worth of European products in 
retaliation for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of importers have argued that certain products should be  
excluded from the tariffs because of economic harm to their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in late May or early June will release the  
final list of goods that will be subject to the punitive tariffs, 
Scher said. 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the 20-member European  
Commission will examine the scientific committee's report and 
decide by May 13 whether to ask the WTO for an extension of the 
ban.

<HEADLINE> $7.9M Awarded in N.C. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The families of two men killed when a  
fired worker went on a shooting rampage won $7.9 million Tuesday 
from a jury that found the company was negligent in protecting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $3.9 million to the family of Gerald Allman,  
52, and $4 million to the family of Frank Knox, 62. Both men were 
shot and killed on May 17, 1995, by James Floyd Davis at the Union 
Butterfield tool distribution plant in south Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	The key issue at the civil trial was whether company officials  
properly protected employees from Davis, who was fired two days 
earlier because of a string of violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This verdict shows that companies cannot ignore a real,  
credible threat of workplace violence,'' said David Kirby, who 
represented the Allman family. ``This man was a ticking time bomb 
and the management knew it, yet they did nothing to protect their 
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees testified that plant managers were told that Davis had  
threatened that if he were fired he would come back and ``take 
management with me.'' Others cried from worry, and some planned 
escape routes, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found that Union Butterfield Corp. and Dormer Tools  
Inc., which jointly operate the tool center, were negligent. Both 
firms shared space and workers at the plant and are wholly owned 
subsidiaries of Sanvick, a multinational corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Union Butterfield did not return telephone calls.  
Fred Barbour, an attorney for Dormer Tools, said an appeal was 
likely. He said Davis was a Union Butterfield employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed and two wounded in the shooting. Davis  
was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and is on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did not award any damages to two plaintiffs, a  
warehouse foreman who was wounded and a Union Butterfield vice 
president for finance who was killed. Attorneys on both sides said 
they believed jurors denied damages to the two managers because of 
their possible roles in failing to properly protect the plant from 
such an attack.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Co. To Purchase Wang Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Wang Global, the pioneering computer maker whose  
fortunes swung from industry powerhouse to bankruptcy, is being 
acquired by Dutch company Getronics NV for $2 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The union with Getronics will form the largest computer services  
company in Europe and one of the five largest in the world, company 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company is expected to have annual revenues of  
about $5 billion, with 33,000 employees and operations in more than 
44 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Getronics will purchase Wang for  
$29.25 a share, as well as warrants, options and other securities. 
Shares of Wang surged to $28.62 1/2, up $3.12 1/2, in trading on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang peaked in the mid 1980s when it manufactured word  
processors and closet-sized ``minicomputers,'' but it stumbled 
badly later in the decade when it failed to negotiate the computing 
world's transition to modern networked and desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1951 by An Wang, a Chinese immigrant  
who came to the United States to earn a Ph.D. at Harvard 
University. Then known as Wang Laboratories, the firm began with 
Wang's $600 in savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company went public in 1967 to finance its expansion in the  
calculator market, but sold that business in the mid-1970s to begin 
making word processors and minicomputers. Wang sales rose from $543 
million in 1980 to $2.4 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	But as personal computers became the workplace standard and the  
company began to slide, An Wang announced a host of new products -- 
many of which did not exist -- in an effort to stem the tide of 
customers switching to other technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost credibility with customers, and it lost $1.9  
billion from 1989 to 1992, when it declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	An Wang died from cancer of the esophagus in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	Wang emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993  
with chairman and CEO Joseph Tucci at the helm, and reinvented 
itself as a computer services provider, setting up, maintaining and 
helping companies run computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Billerica-based company, about 17 miles north of Boston, now  
has annualized revenues of $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics, based in Amsterdam, currently has no presence in the  
United States. It has about 11,000 employees and provides 
information and computer services in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics had $1.65 billion in revenue in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	A person close to the deal said talks began last year to merge  
the two companies. The source, who would only speak on condition of 
anonymity, said Getronics was looking to expand globally so it 
could continue to provide services for companies that are growing 
increasingly large and more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang, whose stock had been trading sluggishly in the $20 range  
in recent months, was hoping to increase share prices, said the 
person, adding that Getronics executives believe earnings will rise 
at Wang in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Wang bought Olsy Group, the computer services  
division of Italy's Olivetti SpA in a $390 billion deal. The 
transaction left Olivetti, currently involved in a massive bid to 
take over Telecom Italia SpA, with about 17 percent of Wang's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the merger with Getronics came as Wang announced a net  
loss for the first quarter. The company posted a net loss of $57.7 
million, or $1.25 per share, on revenues of $789 million for the 
three months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Whitney, an analyst with Boston-based Advest Inc.,  
called the combination a good match. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice mix of services and there is not a lot of  
overlap,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney said he thought Getronics made a wise investment by  
acquiring Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Wang) reinvented themselves with a very good strategy  
focused on providing those services,'' Whitney said. ``I have them 
scheduled to turn a profit next quarter. I think they've turned the 
corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal is subject to regulatory and Wang shareholder  
approval.

<HEADLINE>  Vladimir Guerrero Leads in Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero's glove is drawing more  
attention than his bat these days, and he's not proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Expos star has more errors -- nine -- than his team  
has wins (seven). His major league-leading total is an astonishing 
number for an outfielder after just one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried or too concerned,'' he said. ``But I want to  
be sure this doesn't become a problem or a habit because some of 
the errors that I've made have been routine plays where I tried to 
be too aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows, maybe it's in the genes. His brother, Wilton, the  
Expos' second baseman, is tied for second in the majors in errors 
with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	No outfielder has reached 20 in one season since Bob Johnson of  
the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics. The post-World War II high in 19 
by Lou Brock (1966) and Chili Davis (1988). 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielders have reached double figures just 12 times in the  
'90s. Before Guerrero made 17 last year, the highest total had been 
13 by Sammy Sosa ('90 and '95). 
</P>
<P>
	Even before an error against St. Louis on Friday night, Guerrero  
became the first outfielder with eight in one month since George 
Bell in July 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only concerned about what's happened, I'm not concerned  
about what could happen,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ``I know 
he's not that bad. Whether he's careless or lacks concentration for 
any reason right now, that's something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after his latest error, Guerrero worked out with Montreal  
coaches Pete Mackanin and Gene Glynn before batting practice, 
forming a pile of balls along the outfield wall after fielding and 
catching one ball after another from a ball-throwing machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to go out there,'' Alou said. ``He works out as hard  
as anybody we've had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While two of his errors this season were on throws, 30 of  
Guerrero's 38 errors since the start of the 1997 season have been 
fielding mistakes, a staggering amount for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	His ninth error this season came on a drive by St. Louis'  
Placido Polanco. Guerrero misjudged the ball off the bat, turning 
to his right as the ball sliced away from him toward the 
right-field corner. He was forced to turn around completely and 
change directions, and the ball popped out of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's a little confused,'' Mackanin said. ``Right  
now, after having watched him play last year and this year, you 
would have to call him a below-average outfielder based on the 
amount of errors he's made. However, the potential is there to be a 
Gold Glove winner and that's what we're trying to get out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Dominican hit a team-record 38 homers, drove in  
109 runs and batted .324 in 1998, his second major league season. 
He is hitting .269 this season with four homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure before it's said and done he's going to be one of the  
best out there,'' said the Cardinals' Willie McGee, a three-time 
Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, he's going to make errors. He's got a tremendous  
amount of ability that he's trying to hone offensively, defensively 
and everywhere. Very seldom do you see a young man with that much 
ability come up and have everything tight, as fast as he rose. 
He'll put in his time out there and get himself tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, McGee views all of Guerrero's errors as growing  
pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're not panicking over there,'' McGee said. ``I  
wouldn't if I had a player that talented. When the time comes, you 
work on it. That's it. That guy, to me, he's going to be one of the 
best players in this game. He's already there and it's scary.''

<HEADLINE> Pillsbury To Buy Hazelwood Bakeries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Pillsbury Co. plans to acquire Hazelwood  
Farms Bakeries from Supervalu Inc. for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood Bakeries is one of the country's largest manufacturers  
of frozen dough to stores for making their own bakery products. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillsbury said in announcing the deal Tuesday that it should be  
completed in late May, subject to Federal Trade Commission 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood Farms Bakeries employs more than 1,000 people in the  
United States at seven manufacturing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supermarket industry's trend toward consolidation has  
supermarkets turning toward larger, more focused suppliers for 
their in-store bakery products,'' said Paul Walsh, Pillsbury 
chairman and chief executive. ``This acquisition positions us as a 
key supplier, with a broad product offering in addition to 
providing the requisite sales and technical service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Wright, Supervalu chairman and chief executive, said the  
sale supports its plan to focus on its core food retailing and 
distribution businesses. Supervalu is based in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillsbury, a Minneapolis-based subsidiary of Diageo PLC,  
produces a range of grocery items, frozen foods and refrigerated 
dough products for international consumer markets. The company is 
also supplies baking and other food products to the food service 
and commercial baking industries.

<HEADLINE> Flea Market Rembrandt Etchings Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A woman who bought an old book for  
$1 at a Netherlands flea market found etchings inside by Dutch 
master Rembrandt that sold for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman bought the book last month in the central Dutch city  
of Utrecht. She found the etchings pressed between the pages along 
with a third etching by one of Rembrandt's students. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashing in on her good fortune, she sold Rembrandt's ``The  
pastry cook'' for $30,000 and ``Beggar with woman'' for $20,000 to 
an anonymous German collector, the Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad 
reported Tuesday. The student's etching went to the same 
Berlin-based dealer for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lucky bargain hunter, who was not identified, reportedly  
wanted even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family from Utrecht who found the etches were not  
satisfied with the $55,000,'' art dealer Toon Wildeboer told 
Algemeen Dagblad. ``When I asked for my 3 percent commission they 
said I could get a beating instead.''

<HEADLINE> Tony Nominations Too Late for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What happens now to the Broadway plays and  
musicals that did -- and did not -- receive Tony Award nominations? 
</P>
<P>
	For some like ``Parade,'' which got nine nominations Monday,  
more than any other show, it won't make any difference. The musical 
about a real-life lynching in Georgia in 1915 closed in February 
after a short run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled, but a little sad,'' said Bernard Gersten,  
executive producer at Lincoln Center Theater, which helped present 
``Parade.'' ``We know it is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some shows gave up without a fight. ``Marlene,'' a look at film  
legend Marlene Dietrich, received two nominations including one for 
its star Sian Phillips. Yet it threw in the towel on Sunday, one 
day before the nominations came out. 
</P>
<P>
	For other shows, such as ``Not About Nightingales,'' ``The  
Lonesome West,'' and ``Side Man,'' still running and struggling at 
the box office, there's hope for a boost in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	All three gained best-play nominations and the impetus to carry  
on until at least June 6, when the winners are announced. 
``Nightingales,'' written by Tennessee Williams in 1938 but never 
done on Broadway until now, received a lift. The prison drama got 
six nominations including actor (Corin Redgrave) and director 
(Trevor Nunn) nods. 
</P>
<P>
	The other best-play nominee ``Closer'' will have to sell its  
status as a candidate for best play and not its actors. None of its 
four performers, including Natasha Richardson, got a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Amy's View,'' the star -- Oscar winner Judi Dench -- is the  
thing, not the play. She received a nomination, but the play 
didn't. Not that it matters. ``Amy's View'' is a hot ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	So are the season's two big revivals -- ``Death of a Salesman''  
and ``The Iceman Cometh.'' They are going head-to-head for the 
revival award and in the actor category where ``Salesman's'' Brian 
Dennehy faces ``Iceman's'' Kevin Spacey. It's a toss-up as to who 
will win -- but that makes for an exciting horse race. And tickets 
even harder to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Question marks hover over shows that didn't get major  
nominations or none at all. ``The Weir,'' Conor McPherson's small 
Irish pub drama, was blanked. Now it will have fight for attention 
against plays that have nominations to sell. The same goes for 
``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm,'' which wasn't expecting any 
musical nominations -- and didn't get any. 
</P>
<P>
	``Footloose'' also failed to get a best-musical nod, which means  
no production number on the Tony telecast. The four minutes of 
national television exposure will benefit ``Fosse,'' a celebration 
of choreographer Bob Fosse; ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' 
another revue, and ``The Civil War,'' composer Frank Wildhorn's pop 
history pageant.

coaches Pete Mackanin and Gene Glynn before batting practice, 
forming a pile of balls along the outfield wall after fielding and 
catching one ball after another from a ball-throwing machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to go out there,'' Alou said. ``He works out as hard  
as anybody we've had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While two of his errors this season were on throws, 30 of  
Guerrero's 38 errors since the start of the 1997 season have been 
fielding mistakes, a staggering amount for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	His ninth error this season came on a drive by St. Louis'  
Placido Polanco. Guerrero misjudged the ball off the bat, turning 
to his right as the ball sliced away from him toward the 
right-field corner. He was forced to turn around completely and 
change directions, and the ball popped out of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's a little confused,'' Mackanin said. ``Right  
now, after having watched him play last year and this year, you 
would have to call him a below-average outfielder based on the 
amount of errors he's made. However, the potential is there to be a 
Gold Glove winner and that's what we're trying to get out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Dominican hit a team-record 38 homers, drove in  
109 runs and batted .324 in 1998, his second major league season. 
He is hitting .269 this season with four homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure before it's said and done he's going to be one of the  
best out there,'' said the Cardinals' Willie McGee, a three-time 
Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, he's going to make errors. He's got a tremendous  
amount of ability that he's trying to hone offensively, defensively 
and everywhere. Very seldom do you see a young man with that much 
ability come up and have everything tight, as fast as he rose. 
He'll put in his time out there and get himself tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, McGee views all of Guerrero's errors as growing  
pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're not panicking over there,'' McGee said. ``I  
wouldn't if I had a player that talented. When the time comes, you 
work on it. That's it. That guy, to me, he's going to be one of the 
best players in this game. He's already there and it's scary.''

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hard-Liners Losing Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The hard-line clergy that has  
wielded absolute power in Iran for 20 years is losing a power 
struggle against reformists fighting for greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-liners have suffered a string of crushing defeats  
against supporters of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, a 
middle-ranking cleric who was elected two years ago. But nearly all 
their efforts to stall his reforms have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami is so overwhelmingly popular among Iranians that  
opposing him can mean political suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	One hard-line parliament deputy found angry protesters outside  
his home after he criticized the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners suffered an important defeat Saturday when an  
impeachment bill they sponsored against Khatami's culture minister 
ended in a vote of confidence for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani is a staunch ally of  
Khatami and the driving force behind his reforms. He had angered 
hard-liners by allowing newspapers and intellectuals to speak out -- 
a move that led to a barrage of criticism of the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, for the first time since it came to power in the  
1979 Islamic revolution, the clergy was made accountable to the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	After a fiery defense of freedom and tolerance before parliament  
Saturday, Ataollah Mohajerani defeated the impeachment bill 135 to 
121. Mohajerani kept his job because enough independent deputies 
allied with the hard-liners switched sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohajerani's victory in the Majlis, or parliament, was a wake-up  
call for the hard-liners, who until now had held sway over the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, they impeached the interior minister for allowing  
political gatherings and relaxing Islamic rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Both factions are girding for the next big battle, expected in  
next year's elections for the Majlis. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was seen by both sides as a trial run for the Majlis  
vote, Khatami's supporters swept the country's first elections for 
city councils in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The unelected hard-line supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  
has the final say on all matters and has direct control of the 
Intelligence Ministry, the judiciary, the armed forces, and the 
broadcast network. 
</P>
<P>
	But his influence over these key institutions is eroding.  
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence minister was forced to resign in February after  
disclosures that rogue agents in his ministry killed five Iranian 
dissidents and intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretive ministry is being overhauled to make it more open  
and accountable, Iranian newspapers have reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The judiciary has convicted allies of the president on various  
charges and closed pro-Khatami newspapers, while taking no action 
against vigilantes who have broken up pro-democracy gatherings and 
attacked dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The tenure of the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad  
Yazdi, ends this year. Khamenei is under tremendous pressure to 
name a more evenhanded judge to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio and television network the hard-liners control has  
become the butt of jokes among Iranians for its often one-sided 
coverage of events in Iran. For more impartial news, Iranians turn 
to the many newspapers that have mushroomed under Culture Minister 
Mohajerani. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, as the hard-liners have grown more  
desperate, their supporters have physically attacked Khatami's 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence is expected to continue, and could increase. The  
hard-line clergy is fighting for political survival; its supporters 
believe the fight is between good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of resorting to an army coup, the hard-liners have little  
chance of standing against the wave of popular support for Khatami. 
A coup is unlikely, because the Iranian military overwhelmingly 
supported Khatami in the 1997 vote and has little experience of 
internal suppression. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point of the 1979 revolution came when the shah's  
army refused to shoot at demonstrators. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Parents Seek Blocks for Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The deadly school shootings in Littleton,  
Colo., have created a surge in business for some Internet service 
providers and manufacturers of special software that alerts parents 
to their children's online hangouts and lets them block hate 
groups, bomb-making instructions and other questionable material. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want your kids to sit down and use the Internet. We want  
to make sure they don't get exposed to adult-oriented material, 
hate or discrimination areas, illegal activities or organizations 
giving advice on lock-picking, bomb-making, fraud or breaching 
computer security,'' said Carmen DiCamillo, president of 
Ivyton-based Voicenet. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCamillo said his 100,000-customer Internet service provider  
received scores of calls from parents about its optional ``Web 
Control'' service that weeds out such sites after the April 20 
shootings that left 15 dead at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Across the country, parents are stunned, worried and unsure in  
many cases where to turn,'' said Laurie Lipper, director of The 
Children's Partnership, a Washington, D.C.-based children's 
advocacy group that has published a booklet entitled ``The 
Children's Guide to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lipper said the group urges people to learn about the tools  
Internet service providers offer, such as America Online's parental 
controls that let subscribers limit children's Internet time, use 
of e-mail and chat rooms and creation of Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents prefer to install filtering software on their home  
computers that can be exactly tailored to their concerns, while 
others consider monitoring devices a violation of trust, Lipper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough parents did opt for monitoring to make Net Nanny the No.  
2 seller last week on Netscape's Software Store sales portal, up 
from No. 5 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Net Nanny copies downloaded for evaluation  
increased 10 percent last week, said Gordon Ross, president of Net 
Nanny Software Inc. in Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said Net Nanny, used by more than 1 million people, can be  
set for any level of security from disconnecting the machine if the 
wrong words or phrases are used to just tracking and recording 
Internet contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, if a parent doesn't want to interfere with a child's  
online activities, he said, ``You can at least know that the word 
'bomb' has been mentioned and you can investigate that later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potential buyers downloaded 10 percent to 15 percent more  
evaluation copies last week of CYBERsitter, which is used by nearly 
2 million people, said Marc Kanter, vice president of Solid Oak 
Software in Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanter said the Colorado slayings had parents worried about what  
children can learn if unsupervised online. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a child wants to find material like how to make a bomb, it  
is as simple as typing a couple of words and it is endless what you 
can find,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCamillo said his service frees parents from the need to  
frequently update lists of blocked sites on their home computer by 
doing daily updates at Voicenet. He said the service is also 
popular with schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to expose their students to the wonderful  
educational benefits of the Internet but at the same time they 
would like to isolate them from the seedier, undesirable side,'' 
DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Basnage, instructional technology coordinator at the  
Mosaica Academy Charter School in Bensalem, said the school uses 
Web Control as ``a good first level of precaution'' for the nearly 
200 computers used by teachers and 450 kindergarten through 
sixth-grade pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some software, Basnage said, ``There is no underground  
knowledge about how to disable it. Kids have filtering software at 
home, and in discussions what you hear is, 'We have a filter at 
home but I know the password.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics cautioned that Internet filters may weed out good  
sites along with the bad. In addition, said David Sobel, general 
counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in 
Washington, D.C., ``We fear that it can really be a quick fix to a 
very complicated problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A school or a community is possibly giving itself a false  
sense of security if it tells itself that the problem is 
information on the Internet and the answer is to place some 
software on computers,'' Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipper urged parents not to let fears about bombs and  
pornography overshadow the good things children can find on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	She cited the American Library Association Web page, which lists  
more than 700 kid-friendly sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line is that there is no substitute at any age for  
just being in touch with your kid and having some sense of what 
they are up to,'' Lipper said. ``And never assume you can disengage 
from what your child does online, no matter what kind of devices 
you use, or how old they are.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses EU Report on Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A European Union report that contends a growth  
hormone in American beef may cause cancer is an attempt to delay 
trade obligations to lift a ban on hormone beef, U.S. officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supposed new claims are nothing but misleading  
allegations,'' said Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on 
agricultural matters, calling the report a ``blatant attempt'' by 
the EU to delay abiding by its trade obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the EU does not lift this ban, we will retaliate this  
summer,'' Scher told a Senate subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the EU's Scientific Committee on  
Veterinary Measures said the hormone 17 beta-oestradiol -- one of 
six growth hormones in American beef -- ``has to be considered as a 
complete carcinogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It exerts both tumor initiating and tumor promoting effects,''  
the report said. ``In plain language, this means that even small 
additional doses of residues of this hormone in meat, arising from 
its use as a growth promoter in cattle, has an inherent risk of 
causing cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was inadequate data to make a definitive finding on other  
growth hormones used in U.S. beef, the scientific committee said. 
But it said exposure to small levels of residues in meat and meat 
products ``carries risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky said the EU had issued ``yet another misleading 
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It repeats the same unsubstantiated arguments that the EU has  
already made before the (World Trade Organization) panel of 
experts, which were flatly rejected by the panel,'' they said in a 
joint statement. ``The issue is the EU's refusal to comply with the 
WTO rulings and its unwillingness to honor its international 
obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokesman Gerard Kiely countered Tuesday that the United  
States is wrong to criticize the report before reading the entire 
document, which will be made available later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unwise to dismiss scientific evidence. The United States  
should wait for the full report,'' Kiely said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to cattle to make them 
grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled a year ago that the EU ban on hormone-treated beef  
was illegal and must be lifted by May 13. It said the EU's ban was 
not supported by the proper risk analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, the U.S. has exported only hormone-free beef to the  
EU because of the ban. The U.S. industry has put the lost export 
sales at $500 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is threatening to impose 100 percent  
tariffs on more than $900 million worth of European products in 
retaliation for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of importers have argued that certain products should be  
excluded from the tariffs because of economic harm to their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in late May or early June will release the  
final list of goods that will be subject to the punitive tariffs, 
Scher said. 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci has said the 20-member European  
Commission will examine the scientific committee's report and 
decide by May 13 whether to ask the WTO for an extension of the 
ban.

<HEADLINE> Some 'Reality Shows' May Be Staged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It turns out that some of the wild action on  
Fox's popular reality-based television specials may not be so real 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of the ``World's Wildest Police Videos'' were accused  
of staging some of the cases on its programs, and the network's 
other specials were accused of being misleading in a report Monday 
by the syndicated newsmagazine ``Inside Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one episode of ``World's Wildest Police Videos,'' the show's  
host said that ``our cameras were there when the call came in'' 
about a felon on the loose in Lowndes County, Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The segment, which aired March 25, showed the person using  
pepper spray on an officer and taking off on a high-speed car chase 
before being apprehended by police with guns and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Inside Edition'' quotes Sgt. J.D. Yeager of the Lowndes  
County Sheriff's Department as saying the tape was a staged 
re-creation of a chase that took place nearly 10 years earlier. The 
woman portraying the felon was actually a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another segment depicting a suspect beaching a boat and then  
being tackled by pursuing police officers was actually a police 
training video, the newsmagazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stajonovich, who produces the ``World's Wildest Police  
Videos'' series of specials for Fox, did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said that in the future, any video that does not reflect  
reality would be clearly identified as such by a text message 
appearing on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Network policy remains to clearly identify all re-creations,  
re-enactments and training video within any reality program,'' Fox 
said in a statement. ``Producers must adhere to this policy, as Fox 
does not intend to mislead its viewers or misrepresent footage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokeswoman could not say whether that policy had been  
followed during ``World's Wildest Police Videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has been a leader in developing reality shows, which have  
attracted big ratings as well as controversy. Other networks have 
tried their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine also alleges that a video of a rampaging  
elephant shown in a 1997 special, ``When Animals Attack,'' actually 
depicted an actor and trained elephant recreating an earlier 
attack. Viewers were not told it was a recreation, the show said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers of Fox's ``Busted on the Job'' series routinely make  
up stories to go along with some of its tapes, such as one that 
shows a woman urinating on her boss's furniture, the show said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick Nelson, who produces ``Busted on the Job,'' said he makes  
a comedy show and occasionally changes details to protect people 
caught in embarrassing acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is it's the Christian thing to do to change some  
details so people who see it can't say, `was that you I saw on 
television?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his show never airs doctored videos.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Cuts Boost Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- World oil producers who have traditionally  
offered only lip service about cutting output are putting their 
words into action. The result will be higher crude oil prices 
around the globe and probably more gasoline price hikes for 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	An eagerly awaited report from the Organization of Petroleum  
Exporting Countries this week or next is expected to show that OPEC 
members are abiding by their recent pledge to trim production. 
Analysts said Tuesday that could help push crude above $20 a 
barrel, nearly twice was it was last December. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, higher gasoline prices will be with us for the  
forseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't see any huge increases like the spike we had  
for the six-week period from mid-March through April,'' AAA 
spokesman Jerry Cheske said Tuesday. ``The way things are now, 
prices might rise another nickel a gallon or may even have peaked, 
but they're not going to go down again soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline now averages about $1.23 per gallon around the country,  
up from just 99 cents in February. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway,  
agreed in March to cut their combined daily production by 2.7 
percent, or 2.1 million barrels, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministry in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer,  
said Tuesday that a report due in the next few days will show 
countries participating in the latest round of cuts reached nearly 
80 percent of that goal in April, with 100 percent compliance 
likely to come later this month. Most of the major producers 
already have said in separate reports that they've reached their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC seems to have met or exceeded what was needed to turn on  
the market,'' said John Saucer, an energy analyst for Solomon Smith 
Barney in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of cuts comes on top of 3.1 million in  
reductions pledged over the past year -- moves that had little 
effect on prices at the pump amid weak demand in Asia and Europe, 
widespread cheating on exports and increased output from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices for crude have jumped since March in futures trading  
as anecdotal confirmation of the latest round of cuts began to come 
in, including a steep decline in imports to America and 
cancellation of some large orders to European and Asian buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for delivery in June finished at $18.93 barrel Tuesday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, about 83 percent higher than a 
12-year low of $10.35 a barrel posted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides OPEC cutbacks, other factors have contributed to the oil  
price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, Americans took to the roads for an early start to the  
peak driving season. And, several refineries experienced production 
problems in California, one of the largest consumer states. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand to the Far East, which fell sharply last year, also is on  
the rise. Recent estimates have demand in that region rising this 
year by about 2 percent, said analyst Ed Kevelson at Paribas 
Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wouldn't have been a big story a year ago, but it's a big  
story from where we came,'' Kevelson said. ``With what looks like a 
solid driving season on the way in the United States and Europe and 
rebounding Asian demand, and reduced production, the market has 
been pricing in a target of about $20.50 a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means the glory days of prices below $1 a gallon for  
regular unleaded gasoline are likely over. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a chance oil producers, heady over the recent  
increases, could return to the ways of the past and begin exporting 
beyond their pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to see them in their best behavior mode in  
May and probably June,'' said Saucer of Solomon Smith Barney. 
``After that, there may be some `leakage', but they've finally 
begun to realize that tough times call for tough measures. There's 
not a lot of incentive for them after seeing prices fall so low 
last year to go back to that.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Have Missed Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a simple question almost casually put  
to a software executive during his testimony in the Microsoft 
trial, but the answer he gave -- and what he didn't say -- may play a 
central role in the next phase of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaware of secret negotiations between America Online and  
Netscape to forge a new $9.9 billion alliance, a Microsoft lawyer 
asked the AOL executive under oath whether the companies were 
planning to team up against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In that instant, in a courtroom packed with journalists, months  
of sensitive talks between AOL and Netscape were suddenly at risk 
of a very public disclosure that could scuttle the deal -- still 
weeks away from being announced. 
</P>
<P>
	David Colburn, AOL's senior vice president and a lawyer himself,  
cautiously answered that AOL, the world's largest Internet 
provider, was just trying to compete with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	And in what now appears to be an important lost opportunity,  
Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, let the issue drop without 
pressing Colburn further. 
</P>
<P>
	``That answer should have cued the Microsoft lawyer to a natural  
follow-up question -- how?'' said Stephen Gillers, a law school 
professor at New York University. ``If that question had been 
asked, the witness would have had to reveal the plans. This is not 
a situation where I blame the witness. I blame the lawyer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the new AOL alliance has important  
implications for its industry and its trial because it shows that 
competition is thriving and that government intervention is 
unnecessary in such an important sector of the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Monday it plans to question Colburn again, as one  
of the six final witnesses selected for the next phase of its 
antitrust trial. In court papers, lawyers indicated they will ask 
Colburn about the ``completeness and candor'' of his previous 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts say that Colburn's answer, while clearly  
constructed to be intentionally vague, was also carefully enough 
worded not to expose the software executive to allegations of 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic rule is that you get to play the role of the piano --  
unless your opponent strikes the right key, you don't have to play 
that note,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacic said he doesn't believe Colburn can be accused of lying  
under oath, but added that ``the manner in which he answered, the 
cleverness of the effort to sidestep -- that raises questions about 
truthfulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's former chief financial officer, Peter Currie,  
acknowledged last week in a deposition that talks with AOL began in 
late August, even though the sale wasn't publicly disclosed until 
late in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn dropped few hints about the pending purchase even as he  
was cross-examined over two days late in October -- close to the 
peak of the sensitive negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Warden, who has questioned some of the government's most  
important witnesses during the trial, quizzed Colburn on the stand 
about AOL's previous attempts in late 1995 to combine forces 
against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Warden read e-mail sent to AOL from Netscape's co-founder, Marc  
Andreessen, proposing to ``use our unique respective strengths to 
go kick the (expletive) out of the beast from Redmond that wants to 
see us both dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is AOL still trying to do what Mr. Andreessen suggested be  
done to the beast from Redmond?'' Warden asked, almost 
prophetically. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn demurred: ``What do you mean specifically?'' Then, he  
added, ``I think what AOL is trying to do, from my perspective, is 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillers, the law school professor who specializes in evidence  
and ethics, blames Warden for posing ``really a very vague 
question,'' saying that Colburn couldn't be sure precisely what he 
was being asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacic was more generous toward Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully tough, in retrospect,'' he said. ``If you don't  
know what's on the other side of the curtain, it's a bit hard to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft say the  
deal is irrelevant to charges that the software giant illegally 
maintains a monopoly over the market for computer operating 
systems.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Satellite Launch Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force has formally declared  
mission failure for an $800 million satellite that was launched 
into an orbit thousands of miles too low last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement on Tuesday was needed before the Air Force  
could appoint a board to investigate the accident, spokesman Aaron 
Renenger said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third failed mission in 8 1/2 months involving the Air  
Force's Titan IV rocket program. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force controllers have stabilized the Milstar communication  
satellite and extended its electricity-generating solar wings since 
its launch Friday aboard a Titan IV rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	But the satellite remains in a lopsided orbit with a high point  
of only 3,100 miles. That orbit poses no threat of an uncontrolled 
fall through the atmosphere, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has yet to determine whether the satellite can be  
boosted using on-board fuel and thrusters, whether it can be of any 
use where it is, or how to eventually dispose of it. It's too soon 
to say whether the satellite will be able to achieve its original 
mission, Renenger said. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation board will begin its work this week at Cape  
Canaveral Air Station. Preliminary indications are that the Titan 
IV worked fine during the first several minutes of the flight, but 
an upper-stage rocket misfired and failed to put the Milstar in its 
intended 22,300-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third failed mission in a row for the Air Force's  
Titan IV, with losses totaling $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began last August when a Titan IV carrying a spy  
satellite blew up shortly after liftoff. Then a missile-warning 
satellite was placed in too low of an orbit following its launch 
aboard a Titan IV on April 9.

<HEADLINE> Lisa Ling Wins Seat on 'The View' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After seven years in high schools -- lots of them  
-- Lisa Ling will be getting some postgraduate work in television. 
</P>
<P>
	The California native was announced as the winner Monday in the  
highly public competition for the fifth seat on daytime TV's ``The 
View.'' The 26-year-old replaces Debbie Matenopolous, who was let 
go at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling's the ``young one,'' with her under-age 30 status a chief  
qualification. She joins the ABC show's other members Joy Behar, 
Star Jones, Meredith Vieira and Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	She's worked for the past seven years on Channel One, the  
satellite news service beamed into high schools and middle schools 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling, who came onto the show's set Monday trailing a marching  
band, says her toughest task now is to find an apartment in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	She beat out two other finalists: Fox sports anchor Lauren  
Sanchez and Rachel Campos, a former cast member of MTV's ``Real 
World.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed higher across the  
board Tuesday on the back of another record rally overnight on Wall 
Street, with the key index in Bangkok soaring 10 percent to its 
highest level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets remained closed Tuesday for a  
national holiday. The markets, which will also be closed Wednesday, 
reopen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices soared as investor sentiment was bolstered by  
Moody's Investors Service's decision to change its outlook for 
Thailand's debt ratings to positive from stable, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index surged 46.40  
points, or 10.3 percent to 505.75, its highest level since March, 
19, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia shares closed sharply higher for a second day, boosted  
by positive domestic economic news and Wall Street's 
record-breaking performance overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 4.75 percent,  
or 24.883 points, to a 15-month high of 548.241. On Monday, the 
index had surged almost 6 percent after the government said 
Indonesia's economy grew 1.34 percent in the first three months of 
1999 from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta bourse also got a boost from the Dow Jones  
Industrial Average's 2.1 percent surge to 11,014.69 Monday, a 
record high and the fastest move between 1,000-point milestones in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, shares prices also soared in reaction to overnight  
gains on Wall Street. The benchmark Weighted Stock Price Index rose 
204.78 points, or 2.8 percent, to 7,588.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese investors take their cues from U.S. stock markets  
because of the close manufacturing ties between Taiwanese companies 
and those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares continued to surge following an interest rate  
cut on Monday and overnight gains in U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 20.35  
points, or 3 percent, to 698.23. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 222.62 points,  
or 1.7 percent, closing at 13,559.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices opened sharply higher, with the key  
index soaring more than 350 points in early trading in reaction to 
record gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares fell back slightly later in the session on  
selective profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 9.63 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 2,266.90. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, with the main index  
posting its strongest finish in 21 months in reaction to Wall 
Street's record gains Monday, traders said. The 30-company 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index, or PSE Index, rose 18.10 points, 
or 0.7 percent, to 2,464.84. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher as resource stocks  
chalked up another session of hefty gains. The All Ordinaries Index 
rose 9.4 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,083.9. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, boosted by sharp gains  
overnight on Wall Street. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index 
rose 14.64 points, or 1.9 percent, to 771.17.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Unfamiliar Turf for Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When the playoffs begin this weekend, the Miami  
Heat and Indiana Pacers will be chasing the Eastern Conference 
title while the Chicago Bulls sit home counting lottery picks. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the Bulls hadn't demolished their team after Michael  
Jordan retired? 
</P>
<P>
	What if they'd thrown a whole bunch of money at Scottie Pippen,  
Luc Longley, Steve Kerr and the rest of the gang and persuaded them 
to stay for one last go-around? Could Chicago have won the East 
and, possibly, a seventh title? 
</P>
<P>
	Depends who's asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would have been right there,'' said former Bull Jud  
Buechler, now with the Detroit Pistons. ``It seems like there's not 
really one team that's really dominating. If we would have brought 
everyone back, who knows? If there weren't any injuries to our 
team, I think we could have been in the mix for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the mix, maybe. But win it all? No way, general manager Jerry  
Krause said. Not without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was such a big part in the locker room. He made  
everyone around him better, and filling that hole would have been 
near impossible,'' Krause said. ``We thought we could win a bunch 
of games, but winning a championship, we did not think we had the 
ability to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Jordan retired, the Bulls were showing signs the  
reign was coming to an end. They barely got by Indiana in last 
year's Eastern Conference finals. Not even ``Judge Judy'' could 
have reconciled coach Phil Jackson and Krause. Dennis Rodman was 
getting weirder -- and that's tough to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were getting older, too, with Longley the only starter  
under 30. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Jordan hung up his sneakers in January, the Bulls  
decided it was best to gut the team and start over. The first to go 
was Pippen, who -- feeling underappreciated and underpaid -- was 
looking to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to come out west, so I don't know what would  
have happened,'' said Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
deal with the Rockets. ``I was looking to move on, and that's what 
I did. Whether or not we could have stayed together as a team and 
been successful is difficult to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not like anyone else is lighting up the league, though.  
Indiana, anointed the favorite before the lockout even ended, has 
struggled. Miami lost to the Bulls over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other coast, the Utah Jazz are vulnerable, the Rockets  
have yet to live up to their hype and the Los Angeles Lakers need 
therapy more than a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys had been there,'' said Frank Hamblen, a Bulls  
assistant under Jackson and now Tim Floyd. ``Plus, Michael, as 
great as he is, we still had a lot of good players left who knew 
the system, played together and been champions together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have been hard, but I still think we would  
have been right there as far as in the East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Bulls are 13-36 with one game left, the third-worst  
record in the NBA. Even with a victory Wednesday, they're 
guaranteed to finish with the worst winning percentage in franchise 
history. They've set or tied all kinds of lowlights, including the 
NBA's record for fewest points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But as bad as this season is, Krause said re-signing everyone  
would have doomed Chicago for years. Pippen, Longley and Kerr 
signed five-year deals worth a total of $118 million, meaning the 
Bulls would have had little, if any, salary-cap room the next few 
years. Now Chicago has oodles of cap room and a bunch of extra 
draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have been capped with the oldest team in the league  
and no way to get younger,'' Krause said. ``And one of the worst 
things I think you can do is come fairly close and be old and 
capped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in the end, do the what-ifs really matter? What's done is  
done, said Ron Harper, the only starter left in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look around and sit back and say, 'I'd hoped we had  
our same team here,''' he said. ``If we would have kept half our 
team here, I think we would have been there. But it didn't happen, 
so life goes on.''

<HEADLINE> Cos. Hear Disgruntled Voices on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When disgruntled customer Phil Van der Vossen  
launched a Web page in February to bash Internet retailer Buy.com, 
he was trying to be a thorn in their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Little did he expect that two months later, he would be on an  
all-expense paid trip to California to meet with the consumer 
electronics merchant's top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never imagined that they would ever care enough to even look  
at the site, no less fly me out there to talk about how to improve 
their business,'' the 20-year-old University of Maryland student 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people like Van der Vossen are taking their rage to  
the Internet these days, venting their displeasure over everything 
from Dunkin Donuts to Bally Total Fitness health clubs to an 
audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	And because of the widespread reach of the Internet, a growing  
number of companies are starting to pay attention, realizing that 
bad publicity online can be a threat to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Some businesses are assigning staffers or hiring cyber-snooping  
specialists to scour for vengeful Web pages and eavesdrop in chat 
rooms. Others are buying up the domain names most likely to be used 
for negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Internet universe, nothing replaces word of mouth and  
word of mouth can spread fast,'' said Darryl Peck, chairman and 
chief executive of Cyberian Outpost, an online computer seller. 
``You can't ignore what is being said out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is the fastest growing means of communication and  
information in society today. Last year, about 37 percent of all 
U.S. households were online, compared with about 27 percent in 
1997, according to the New York-based Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	As cyberspace grows, so do the number of anti-company Web sites  
and discussion groups. Consumers are quickly realizing that the 
Internet is an unregulated space where they can reach people 
worldwide instantly for very little cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a very effective new weapon for the  
consumer,'' said Patricia Sturdevant, general counsel to the 
Washington-based National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
``Before the Internet, unless you had a lot of time or money, there 
wasn't any way to get the public's attention to a problem. Now, you 
can broadcast it to the entire world in an instant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what inspired Van der Vossen to launch his site against  
Buy.com, www.buycrap.cjb.net. He was outraged by the company's 
pricing foul-up for a computer monitor and wanted to warn others to 
not shop at the online store. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy.com had mistakenly priced a Hitachi monitor on its Web site  
at $164.50, which was about $400 below cost. The company took 1,600 
orders before realizing the error. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, shoppers were given mixed messages over whether they would  
get the monitor at the bargain price and some were even charged for 
it on their credit cards without ever receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted people to know that there had been many problems with  
Buy.com and that they couldn't be trusted,'' said Van der Vossen, 
whose site includes links to other anti-Buy.com sites, news 
coverage on the company and direct e-mail to the CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 5,000 people logged on to my site in the first week,  
so I know that people were interested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those people happened to be Buy.com's executives, who  
were trying to keep up with the bad publicity scattered about them 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew many of the things that I was seeing on the Internet  
were true and we needed to start changing them,'' said Greg 
Hawkins, who took over as chief executive about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company has yet to remedy the monitor debacle, the  
experience inspired it to revamp its business. Many of its planned 
changes come directly from comments they read online, including the 
addition of more customer service representatives and telling 
shoppers if an item is in stock or on back-order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cognizant of the things we want to change because they  
were communicated to us over the Internet, on Web sites and in the 
chat rooms,'' Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant pension system TIAA-CREF also learned that watching  
the Web pays off. In the midst of the Asian economic crisis in 
October, someone posted in a CompuServe discussion room that the 
company's Global Equities pension fund had 25 percent of its assets 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fund only had a 5 percent stake in Asia. Since the error  
was caught within days, the company was able to contact the chat 
room mediator and stop a rumor that had the potential to spur an 
exodus of investors from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the Web is like competitive intelligence,'' said Alan  
Shea, who runs the new Internet monitoring company EclipZe. ``You 
need to keep track of who is saying what and who is doing what to 
stay ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping an eye on the Internet keeps companies abreast of  
consumers' opinions, many are still struggling with how to respond 
to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to know whether or not something is a legitimate  
gripe or problem, or whether a company should respond to every Web 
site and posting,'' said Jason Alexander, founder of Ewatch, a 
company that scours the Internet on the behalf of its corporate 
clients and helps them determine when to intervene. ``It's hard to 
decide when to reach out and when to just sit back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies are attempting to protect themselves from an  
organized attack by registering negative domain name themselves. 
Chase Manhattan Bank, for instance, owns ihatechase.com, 
chasesucks.com and chasestinks.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has a media analyst on  
staff who tracks references to the company on the Internet, but its 
policy it to act only when it sees something that infringes on its 
logo or brand identity or defames the company, said spokeswoman Joy 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberian Outpost will join an online discussion only if it feels  
that it will help remedy a problematic situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are there monitoring, but unless it is something that we  
really feel that we need to jump into, we let the customers just 
talk about it themselves,'' said Outpost's CEO Peck. ``Watching the 
Web is an information tool that helps us improve our business.''

<HEADLINE> Jury: Execute California Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- One of the longest and costliest murder  
cases in California history came to a close when a jury recommended 
the death penalty for a man convicted of killing 11 people in a 
sex-and-torture spree at a mountain cabin in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is over,'' said Sharon Sellitto, whose brother was  
believed to be one of the victims. ``We won. I can't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury that in February convicted Charles Ng of killing  
11 people in the grisly murders recommended the death sentence 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a widely publicized manhunt, Ng's legal case hung in limbo  
for years while he first fought extradition from Canada, then filed 
a series of motions that lengthened the case. He hired and fired 
attorneys and for a time represented himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's lawyer said the 38-year-old defendant virtually wrote his  
own ticket to a death sentence when he decided to testify in the 
guilt phase of his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our client decided against our wishes to take the witness  
stand we felt tactically that wasn't a particularly wise choice on 
his part,'' said attorney William G. Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Kelley had focused jurors' attention on Leonard  
Lake, the psychopathic killer who recruited Ng as his lieutenant in 
a mid-1980s siege of sexual torture, bondage and killing that 
reduced victims to charred fragments buried around a Sierra 
foothills cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied killing anyone and said he didn't know Lake planned to  
kill. But jurors watched graphic videotapes in which Lake and Ng 
were seen tormenting bound women. In one of them, a woman pleads 
for her baby and Ng coldly replies that the baby is ``sleeping like 
a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense suggested during the trial that Lake, who committed  
suicide in 1985, always intended to make Ng the fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan can accept the  
jury's decision or reduce the sentence to life in prison without 
parole. Kelley said he expects the judge to accept the jury's 
recommendation at the June 29 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	The final cost to taxpayers is expected to reach $14 million,  
according to unofficial estimates.

<HEADLINE> AOL Exec Dropped Few Hints of Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A blunt-spoken executive from America Online  
described on the witness stand last fall his company's previous 
failed efforts to forge an alliance with Netscape, the Internet 
software pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	But what is emerging publicly for the first time is the  
revelation that even as David Colburn was testifying in the 
Microsoft trial, AOL was again secretly negotiating with Netscape 
in a remarkable deal that weeks later coalesced into a $9.9 billion 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft disclosed Monday it will call Colburn, who appeared  
unshaven and wearing cowboy boots during earlier testimony, back to 
the trial as a hostile witness. He will be one of the six final 
witnesses during the upcoming rebuttal phase of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it will press Colburn about the implications, if  
any, of AOL's extraordinary purchase of Netscape on both the 
high-tech industry and the trial. The case is expected to resume 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in turn, said it will call Garry Norris, a  
former director at IBM's personal computer division, who negotiated 
Windows contracts with Microsoft and is expected to testify about 
the company's alleged bullying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Colburn, four of the rebuttal witnesses already have  
appeared in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But armed with information only recently made public about the  
merger, Microsoft will have pointed questions for Colburn. In court 
papers, lawyers indicated they will ask him about the 
``completeness and candor'' of his previous testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's former chief financial officer, Peter Currie,  
acknowledged last week in a deposition that talks with AOL began in 
late August, even though the sale wasn't publicly disclosed until 
late in November. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's now clear that Colburn dropped few hints about the  
pending purchase even as he was cross-examined over two days late 
in October -- during the peak of AOL's sensitive negotiations with 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden quizzed Colburn about AOL's  
previous attempts in late 1995 to combine forces against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Warden read e-mail to AOL from Netscape's co-founder, Marc  
Andreessen, proposing to ``use our unique respective strengths to 
go kick the (expletive) out of the beast from Redmond that wants to 
see us both dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is AOL still trying to do what Mr. Andreessen suggested be  
done to the beast from Redmond?'' Warden asked, almost 
prophetically. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn demured: ``What do you mean specifically?'' Then, he  
added, ``I think what AOL is trying to do, from my perspective, is 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warden, apparently unaware of the secret talks going on outside  
the courtroom, didn't pursue the line of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the new AOL alliance illustrates that  
competition is thriving in the industry and that government 
intervention is unnecessary in such an important sector of the 
booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft say the  
deal is irrelevant to charges that the software giant illegally 
maintains a monopoly over the market for computer operating 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that Microsoft, for example, bullies the  
nation's computer makers with restrictions on the sale of Windows, 
and that it sets prices to reward its allies and punish its 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	But until Monday's announcement that Norris will testify, a  
curious hole in the government's case has been the lack in its 
lineup of witnesses from any of those computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also will use testimony from Gordon Eubanks, who  
stepped down weeks ago as president and chief executive officer of 
Symantec Corp., which makes a popular anti-virus program and other 
software utilities that run using Microsoft's Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks, a longtime Microsoft ally, left to become president of  
Oblix Inc., a small computer automation company whose investors 
include Netscape and Novell Inc. -- some of Microsoft's biggest 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks told The New York Times last year, ``Microsoft has done  
some bad things.'' But he argued that Microsoft's chairman, Bill 
Gates, is a victim of the trend toward tearing down successful 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it also will call back Edward Felten, a  
Princeton University computer expert. 
</P>
<P>
	The other witnesses will include two economists who stumbled  
through parts of their earlier testimony, Richard Schmalensee, a 
dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and MIT 
economist Franklin Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Comcast in MediaOne Bidding War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With just two days before the deadline, Comcast  
Corp. is scrambling to put together a higher bid for MediaOne Group 
Inc., the Denver-based cable TV company that is at the heart of one 
of the biggest takeover battles in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, the No. 3 cable company, has until midnight Thursday to  
beat a $54 billion bid from AT&AMP;T Corp., the long-distance phone 
company that broke up a $48 billion deal between Comcast and 
MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is the nation's fourth biggest cable provider. The  
fight for control of its 5 million U.S. cable subscribers and 8.9 
million overseas customers has drawn interest from technology 
titans like Microsoft Corp., America Online Inc., MCI WorldCom and 
even Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who is starting his own 
cable venture. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is that AT&AMP;T and Comcast may make a deal to  
avoid what could be a costly bidding war. The Wall Street Journal 
reported Tuesday night that the two companies have been talking 
about a deal in which Comcast would withdraw from the competition 
for MediaOne in exchange for obtaining 2 million additional cable 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Comcast does put together a bid, the most likely white knight  
is Microsoft, which is sitting on $22 billion in cash, and wants to 
make the software that will drive interactive television and 
high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft already has a $1 billion investment in Comcast, and a  
$213 million investment in MediaOne's RoadRunner unit, which offers 
high-speed Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based software giant, which declined to comment, is  
playing both sides of the fence, negotiating at the same time with 
AT&AMP;T, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. If AT&AMP;T 
is successful in its bid for MediaOne, the long-distance company 
will get access to 60 percent of American homes with cable. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Microsoft will side with the company that offers it  
the most power, the person said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has long been dissatisfied with its stock  
price, is considering creating a separate stock to track the 
performance of its Internet operations as well as any cable 
investments it might make, the person said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the person added, this is just one of many options the  
company might pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's shares fell $1.81 to $78.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, on a day when technology shares fell.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Hear Disgruntled Voices on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When disgruntled customer Phil Van der Vossen  
launched a Web page in February to bash Internet retailer Buy.com, 
he was trying to be a thorn in their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Little did he expect that two months later, he would be on an  
all-expense paid trip to California to meet with the consumer 
electronics merchant's top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never imagined that they would ever care enough to even look  
at the site, no less fly me out there to talk about how to improve 
their business,'' the 20-year-old University of Maryland student 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people like Van der Vossen are taking their rage to  
the Internet these days, venting their displeasure over everything 
from Dunkin Donuts to Bally Total Fitness health clubs to an 
audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	And because of the widespread reach of the Internet, a growing  
number of companies are starting to pay attention, realizing that 
bad publicity online can be a threat to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Some businesses are assigning staffers or hiring cyber-snooping  
specialists to scour for vengeful Web pages and eavesdrop in chat 
rooms. Others are buying up the domain names most likely to be used 
for negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Internet universe, nothing replaces word of mouth and  
word of mouth can spread fast,'' said Darryl Peck, chairman and 
chief executive of Cyberian Outpost, an online computer seller. 
``You can't ignore what is being said out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is the fastest growing means of communication and  
information in society today. Last year, about 37 percent of all 
U.S. households were online, compared with about 27 percent in 
1997, according to the New York-based Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	As cyberspace grows, so do the number of anti-company Web sites  
and discussion groups. Consumers are quickly realizing that the 
Internet is an unregulated space where they can reach people 
worldwide instantly for very little cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a very effective new weapon for the  
consumer,'' said Patricia Sturdevant, general counsel to the 
Washington-based National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
``Before the Internet, unless you had a lot of time or money, there 
wasn't any way to get the public's attention to a problem. Now, you 
can broadcast it to the entire world in an instant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what inspired Van der Vossen to launch his site against  
Buy.com, www.buycrap.cjb.net. He was outraged by the company's 
pricing foul-up for a computer monitor and wanted to warn others to 
not shop at the online store. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy.com had mistakenly priced a Hitachi monitor on its Web site  
at $164.50, which was about $400 below cost. The company took 1,600 
orders before realizing the error. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, shoppers were given mixed messages over whether they would  
get the monitor at the bargain price and some were even charged for 
it on their credit cards without ever receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted people to know that there had been many problems with  
Buy.com and that they couldn't be trusted,'' said Van der Vossen, 
whose site includes links to other anti-Buy.com sites, news 
coverage on the company and direct e-mail to the CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 5,000 people logged on to my site in the first week,  
so I know that people were interested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those people happened to be Buy.com's executives, who  
were trying to keep up with the bad publicity scattered about them 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew many of the things that I was seeing on the Internet  
were true and we needed to start changing them,'' said Greg 
Hawkins, who took over as chief executive about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company has yet to remedy the monitor debacle, the  
experience inspired it to revamp its business. Many of its planned 
changes come directly from comments they read online, including the 
addition of more customer service representatives and telling 
shoppers if an item is in stock or on back-order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cognizant of the things we want to change because they  
were communicated to us over the Internet, on Web sites and in the 
chat rooms,'' Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant pension system TIAA-CREF also learned that watching  
the Web pays off. In the midst of the Asian economic crisis in 
October, someone posted in a CompuServe discussion room that the 
company's Global Equities pension fund had 25 percent of its assets 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fund only had a 5 percent stake in Asia. Since the error  
was caught within days, the company was able to contact the chat 
room mediator and stop a rumor that had the potential to spur an 
exodus of investors from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the Web is like competitive intelligence,'' said Alan  
Shea, who runs the new Internet monitoring company EclipZe. ``You 
need to keep track of who is saying what and who is doing what to 
stay ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping an eye on the Internet keeps companies abreast of  
consumers' opinions, many are still struggling with how to respond 
to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to know whether or not something is a legitimate  
gripe or problem, or whether a company should respond to every Web 
site and posting,'' said Jason Alexander, founder of Ewatch, a 
company that scours the Internet on the behalf of its corporate 
clients and helps them determine when to intervene. ``It's hard to 
decide when to reach out and when to just sit back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies are attempting to protect themselves from an  
organized attack by registering negative domain name themselves. 
Chase Manhattan Bank, for instance, owns ihatechase.com, 
chasesucks.com and chasestinks.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has a media analyst on  
staff who tracks references to the company on the Internet, but its 
policy it to act only when it sees something that infringes on its 
logo or brand identity or defames the company, said spokeswoman Joy 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberian Outpost will join an online discussion only if it feels  
that it will help remedy a problematic situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are there monitoring, but unless it is something that we  
really feel that we need to jump into, we let the customers just 
talk about it themselves,'' said Outpost's CEO Peck. ``Watching the 
Web is an information tool that helps us improve our business.''

<HEADLINE> $7.9M Awarded in N.C. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The families of two men killed when a  
fired worker went on a shooting rampage have won $7.9 million from 
a jury that found the company was negligent in protecting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $3.9 million to the family of Gerald Allman,  
52, and $4 million to the family of Frank Knox, 62. Both men were 
shot and killed on May 17, 1995, by James Floyd Davis at the Union 
Butterfield tool distribution plant in south Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	The key issue at the civil trial was whether company officials  
properly protected employees from Davis, who was fired two days 
earlier because of a string of violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This verdict shows that companies cannot ignore a real,  
credible threat of workplace violence,'' said David Kirby, who 
represented the Allman family. ``This man was a ticking time bomb 
and the management knew it, yet they did nothing to protect their 
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees testified that plant managers were told that Davis had  
threatened that if he were fired he would come back and ``take 
management with me.'' Others cried from worry, and some planned 
escape routes, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the jury found that Union Butterfield Corp. and  
Dormer Tools Inc., which jointly operate the tool center, were 
negligent. Both firms shared space and workers at the plant and are 
wholly owned subsidiaries of Sanvick, a multinational corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Union Butterfield did not return telephone calls.  
Fred Barbour, an attorney for Dormer Tools, said an appeal was 
likely. He said Davis was a Union Butterfield employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed and two wounded in the shooting. Davis  
was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and is on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did not award any damages to two plaintiffs, a  
warehouse foreman who was wounded and a Union Butterfield vice 
president for finance who was killed. Attorneys on both sides said 
they believed jurors denied damages to the two managers because of 
their possible roles in failing to properly protect the plant from 
such an attack.

<HEADLINE> Littleton Changes Rules for Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The classroom-clearing bomb threats, rumors  
and other scares that followed the Littleton, Colo., school 
shooting took their toll. Students spent hours standing outside in 
parking lots and football fields; SAT exams were postponed; some 
schools shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently none of the threats in the week after the April 20  
Columbine High School shootings were substantiated. But schools 
took to heart what in another time might have been dismissed as 
annoying pranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Copycat threats typically appear about a week after the event  
that inspired them, officials say, but the scale of the Littleton 
attack has changed the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, you will take every single kind of threat as if you know  
for certain it's going to occur because you don't have any 
choice,'' said Bruce Hunter of the American Association of School 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools nationwide are making the same call, even realizing  
they're at the mercy of copycats with empty threats. The student 
gunmen who shot to death 12 classmates and a teacher before killing 
themselves apparently had planted explosives at the 1,800-student 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some schools have been more sensitive about it, but when it  
comes to security measures there's no such thing as overreacting,'' 
said Deputy Sheriff Jesus Villahermosa of Pierce County, Wash., who 
advises schools on security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Villahermosa said at least 14 people statewide were arrested  
last week for bomb threats to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	--An Internet threat of a shooting Friday kept home all but 300  
of the 2,100 students at a suburban Phoenix high school. Students 
feared that the April 30 anniversary of Adolf Hitler's suicide 
would spark a shooting. The Columbine killers struck on Hitler's 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Charlotte, N.C., classes and SAT testing at four schools  
were canceled Friday. Police spent the weekend sweeping middle and 
high schools to make sure campuses were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	--District of Columbia schools, which received three days of  
threats last week, had to evacuate all 146 schools one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers can't keep lessons on track because most older students  
simply don't come back to school once it's cleared, said Barbara 
Bullock, president of the Washington Teachers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really interrupting instructional time,'' she said. ``But  
God forbid the day you decide to ignore it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials blame the scrutiny. Nervous parents and the news  
media are watching every step, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shootings are not the rule,'' said Villahermosa. ``We  
need to quit focusing on them.'' He added that most school security 
issues involve noncustodial parents, turf battles that bring kids 
from other schools and drug dealing and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Columbine, said Hunter, ``you can't say that you're  
not going to react anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it had to be a fake,'' said Salaah Elbalghiti, 18, a  
senior who spent his entire lunch one day last week in the parking 
lot waiting for a bomb-sweep of Montgomery-Blair High School, in 
Silver Spring, Md., a Washington suburb. ``But kids should not be 
in the building when there's a bomb threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the short run, they say, they'll have to empty the buildings.  
Long term, they hope peer pressure will take over. Enough canceled 
track meets, tests and band performances might make enough other 
students sick of their peers' pranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Villahermosa nabbed a student who has pulled the fire alarm at  
his school about a dozen times in the past two weeks; some buddies 
turned him in. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just got so tired of it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Courts are coming down on pranksters, too. An 18-year-old youth,  
who was not a student, faces fines of $2.6 million and jail terms 
totaling 1,782 years on dozens of charges in a phoned bomb threat 
that forced the evacuation of 66 schools in Schuylkill County, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter predicts lawmakers will join schools in fighting threats  
and pranks. A Delaware legislator wants stiffer penalties for bomb 
threats, at least six months in prison for a first time, five years 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
	In Collier County in southwest Florida, officials are offering  
$50 rewards for information on students planning violence. Covering 
the county's 34 schools and 34,000 students for the rest of the 
school year, the policy rewards information leading to the 
confiscation of weapons, firearms, bombs, confirmation of a bomb 
threat or other threat of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry more about schools' reaction to kids that aren't  
making threats, but are somehow being associated with the Colorado 
tragedy because they're wearing black trench coats, much like the 
killers' social clique. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union is representing 11 Brimfield,  
Ohio, students who were suspended for contributing to a Web site 
for so-called Goths, a subculture of black-garbed youths that has 
been associated with the Colorado teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just need to really take a deep breath,'' said Ann  
Beeson, a national staff attorney at the ACLU. ``There's a real 
danger that any kid that is not mainstream now is going to be 
considered some kind of threat.''

<HEADLINE> Prostate Blood Test in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A new blood test combined with one already on the  
market could offer men a cheaper and less invasive way to determine 
their risk for prostate cancer, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William J. Catalona, a professor of urologic surgery at  
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who conducted 
the study, said Monday the two tests also catch cancers earlier 
than the traditional timetable for biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, an estimated 184,500 American men develop prostate  
cancer and more than 41,000 die from it, according to the American 
Cancer Society. Early detection increases the chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Used in combination, the blood tests could become an early  
alternative to surgery since doctors are cautious about ordering 
biopsies for patients with slightly elevated levels of cancer 
markers, Catalona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Men age 40 and older, and those with high risks of prostate  
cancer, have typically received annual Tandem free 
prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, tests since the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The PSA test shows when protein levels rise in the bloodstream,  
an indicator of cancer, possibly because it escapes from the 
prostate as tissue is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, known as hK2, measures the human kallikrein 2  
enzyme. Both it and the older test were developed by Hybritech Inc. 
of San Diego, which funded Catalona's study. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona's team studied 937 men. The study showed that the two  
tests used together identified 91 percent of the men who were 
cancer-free and 40 percent of those who had prostate cancer and 
needed further evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of tests could help catch as much as 95 percent  
of prostate cancers and reduce needless biopsies in the group by 20 
percent, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need to catch cancer at a more curable level,''  
said Catalona, who added that the hK2 test needs fine-tuning. He 
presented to his findings to a meeting of the American Urological 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate trouble is a common problem for aging men. The  
walnut-sized gland, which is involved in semen production, 
frequently becomes enlarged in older men and is susceptible to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, men with an intermediate PSA level of 2.5 to 4  
nanograms per milliliter are often told to wait and have the test 
repeated later instead of having a biopsy immediately. A biopsy is 
more likely to be ordered when the PSA count is 4 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said the PSA ranges are not  
an absolute guide to who needs biopsies but are instead a 
weathervane. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Whitesel, chief of urology at the University of  
Colorado, said an additional test ``certainly would help us 
diagnose sooner. The earlier we can diagnose, the better chance we 
have to cure the disease.''

<HEADLINE> Eisner Testifies in Katzenberg Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner  
testified Tuesday that he believed his former film boss Jeffrey 
Katzenberg had a dark side and acknowledged he may have told an 
author, ``I hate the little midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the infamous Hollywood feud between Eisner and  
Katzenberg surfaced during a trial over Katzenberg's claim that 
Disney owes him at least $250 million in bonuses for work he did at 
the company before he quit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In an exchange extraordinary in the secretive entertainment  
industry, Eisner was confronted by Katzenberg's attorney Bert 
Fields on statements Eisner made to Tony Schwartz, collaborator of 
Eisner's autobiography ``Work in Progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was true that Eisner told Schwartz, ``I think I hate  
the little midget,'' referring to Katzenberg, who stands about 
5-foot-4, Eisner -- one of the most powerful men in Hollywood -- 
warned Fields to back off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're getting into an area that I will say is  
ill-advised,'' Eisner told the lawyer. ``I don't think it's 
productive, Mr. Fields. ... You're going down a direction that's 
not in your client's best interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner didn't say why he felt it was wrong to pursue such  
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eisner acknowledged he may have made the statement in anger  
after the bitter breakup of the corporate partners. Katzenberg left 
Disney in 1994 after Eisner refused to promote him to president. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner also acknowledged that he was so mad at Katzenberg he was  
unwilling to reach a settlement in the former executive's claims to 
lucrative bonuses -- a percentage of all the income Disney films and 
merchandise will ever make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney chairman frequently said he couldn't remember events.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a couple of quite emotional and intense conversations  
when he asked to be president of the company,'' Eisner said. ``It's 
like the dentist: You forget pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eisner said he was certain Katzenberg knew and agreed he  
wouldn't get an incentive bonus if he failed to serve out the 
entire contract. 
</P>
<P>
	After early talks, Disney secretly paid Katzenberg $77 million  
in a partial settlement, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> FTC Leads Crackdown on Credit Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Law enforcement agencies are cracking down on  
companies that claim they can help consumers get new credit 
histories with fake Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who applies for credit with a false identification number  
is breaking federal law, Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal 
Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Monday in 
announcing that 16 complains have been filed against various 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``These credit repair con games are spreading like wildfire on  
the Internet and in unsolicited junk e-mail,'' Bernstein said. 
``They target credit-impaired consumers anxious to repair their 
credit profiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisements also are placed in newspapers and magazines, and  
they use phrases such as, ``Anyone can have a new credit file 
virtually overnight,'' or, ``There's a way to obtain a new Social 
Security No.,'' according to investigators with the FTC, the 
Justice Department and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies frequently sell credit repair kits that range in  
price from $21.95 to $129.95, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are frequently given advice about how to develop  
whole new credit profiles by doing such things as getting new 
driver's licenses using the new I.D. number and advised about 
places that will give consumers 'starter credit' using the new 
number,'' the FTC said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Such practices have increased significantly over the past five  
years, said William Cowan, special agent in charge of the Atlanta 
field office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven complaints filed by the FTC and an eighth filed by the  
Justice Department -- all within the last week -- accuse defendants 
of violating the Credit Repair Organizations Act and other laws. 
Another eight cases were announced by state and local law 
enforcement agencies, including the Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma 
and Texas attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaints, the agencies ask federal judges to  
permanently enjoin illegal claims and impose civil penalties.

<HEADLINE> Florida, Insurance Co. Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida reached a $5.5 million  
settlement with American General Corp. over allegations the 
insurance company's subsidiaries deceived customers into buying 
more-expensive policies with the cash value of their current plans. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators said Tuesday the settlement was over a practice  
called churning that eight of the Houston-based company's 
subsidiaries allegedly committed in Florida through the 1980s and 
up until about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Churning describes selling a customer an additional higher-value  
policy and financing the sale by draining the customer's existing 
policy of its cash value, without the customer's full knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came as part of a state investigation into  
deceptive sales practices by a number of insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that from 1982 through 1997, as many as 207,000  
Floridians may have been deceived by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company didn't admit any wrongdoing in the settlement  
agreement. And the majority of the companies alleged to have taken 
part in the practice weren't owned by American General for the 
whole time state regulators said it was used. 
</P>
<P>
	``American General is very satisfied that the resolution is  
appropriate and fair with the state of Florida,'' said company 
spokesman John Pluhowski. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is the third major insurer to settle with Florida in  
as part of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America agreed to pay Florida a  
$15 million fine in February 1997 to settle charges that its agents 
deceived 128,000 customers into using the value of current policies 
to buy more-expensive ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prudential settlement was the largest administrative fine  
ever against a life insurer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida reached a $6 million settlement with John Hancock Mutual  
Life Insurance in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The American General subsidiaries included in the investigation  
were: Franklin Life Insurance Company; American Franklin Life 
Insurance Co.; The United States Life Insurance Company; All 
American Life Insurance Co.; Old Line Insurance Company of America; 
American General Life and Accident Insurance Co.; American General 
Life Insurance Company in New York and American General Life 
Insurance Company.

<HEADLINE> Change in Colo. Victims' Crosses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG ROCK, Ill. (AP) -- A man who erected 15 crosses in Littleton,  
Colo., for the families of those who died in the Columbine High 
School massacre -- only to take them down when they generated 
controversy -- says he's going to raise them again. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Zanis said Monday he has been asked to return to Colorado  
by several people in Littleton, including the families of three 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to put 13 (crosses) on one hill, and two on another  
hill,'' he said, hoping to avoid the controversy that occurred when 
he placed crosses for the two dead gunmen next to those of the 13 
victims. The crosses for the gunmen were knocked down by a man 
whose child had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis established Crosses for Losses in tribute to his  
father-in-law, who was fatally shot in 1996. Since that year the 
Illinois man has built more than 200 crosses and raised them around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the immediate aftermath of the killings, Zanis built the 15  
6-foot crosses, loaded them into his truck and delivered them to a 
hill in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	What Zanis didn't figure on was that along with grief, there was  
the kind of anger at gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold that 
would not allow crosses for them to stand on the same hill with the 
ones dedicated to the people they killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe that people were angry and defiled the  
crosses,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got involved in this whole process to help with healing,''  
said Zanis, 48, outside a youth center near his home west of 
Chicago. ``When I found out the crosses were not healing, I was 
saddened by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the two crosses for the killers were removed, someone put  
two smaller crosses in their place. But the anger remained. So 
Zanis drove back to Colorado to retrieve the crosses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some were upset to see the crosses for the victims  
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis hopes his new arrangement will help people.  
</P>
<P>
	``It bothered him because he feels like that (a cross) is a  
symbol of the Lord,'' said his wife, Susan. ``He just felt like God 
still cares about all those kids.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Lucky To Be in AL West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Their winningest pitcher went to spring  
training just hoping to make the roster. Their most consistent 
hitter is playing every day because two other guys are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not exactly a formula for success, but so far it's  
working for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has been alone atop the AL West the last 16 days, even  
though the Rangers have yet to be more than three games over .500 
the first month of the season. They're 14-12 heading into Wednesday 
night's game at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is coming off a 3-4 homestand against New York and  
Cleveland. That's not a terrible record considering the caliber of 
the opponents, but it dropped the Rangers to 6-8 at The Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played all right at home, but not as well as we  
should,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have yet to get on any sort of a roll. They haven't  
strung together many good starts -- even one in a row has been tough 
-- and their top hitters seem to be streaking at different times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have one or two guys hot here and one or two guys hot  
there, but we haven't had a stretch of five or six days where 
everybody was going at the same time,'' manager Johnny Oates said. 
``They haven't all been clicking yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leadoff hitter Tom Goodwin leads the league in steals, but he's  
been inconsistent at the plate. Rusty Greer has been up-and-down, 
while Juan Gonzalez was mostly down before a good Cleveland series. 
Rafael Palmeiro also heated up over the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Stevens, who usually hits seventh, has been Texas' most  
productive hitter. His .337 average is tops among regulars and he 
leads the team with eight homers. His 17 RBIs are tied for third on 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens and Mike Simms were supposed to split time this season  
at designated hitter, or take turns giving Palmeiro the day off at 
first base. But knee problems have limited Palmeiro to DH duty and 
Simms has been on the DL all season, giving Stevens lots of 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fortunate to stay focused on what I'm doing and to  
stay consistent,'' said Stevens, who hit eight homers in April for 
the second straight season, tying the club record. ``Now I've got 
to keep it up for the next five months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching has been the team's biggest problem. Other than Aaron  
Sele (3-2, 4.45 ERA), the starting rotation has been a mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Helling (2-3, 7.18 ERA) hasn't looked like a guy who won 20  
games last year and Mark Clark (2-2, 7.36) has looked like a guy 
who lost 14 times in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	John Burkett was 0-2 with a 12.00 ERA before going on the  
disabled list and Esteban Loaiza was so bad in long relief that he 
blew his chance to be the fifth starter. Mike Morgan, who was 
invited to spring training without being guaranteed a job, seized 
the opportunity and became the first four-game winner in the majors 
before losing his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The irony behind Texas starters' 10-11 record and 6.41 ERA is  
the fact they've actually been doing a good job of following 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Because none of the starters have dominating stuff, pitching  
coach Dick Bosman wants them to concentrate on throwing strikes. 
Their 38 walks in 26 games proves they are doing that, but the 32 
homers they've allowed shows that the pitches are a bit too good. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting relievers, Texas has allowed a major-league worst 39  
homers.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investor conference calls, once reserved for  
financial analysts and investment bankers, are moving to the 
Internet, where they'll be available to online investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of technology companies will carry the conference calls  
of publicly traded companies live and offer the ability to send 
questions by e-mail during the call. 
</P>
<P>
	CCBN.com, a Boston-based provider of investor relations Web site  
services, and INTERVU Inc., a San Diego-based company that delivers 
audio and video over the Internet, today established an alliance 
that will put the calls online. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, INTERVU's streaming media services will be  
used in CCBN.com's WebCast service, the companies said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	CCBN.com's WebCast will also provide clients with the ability to  
post a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for review during the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Petroleum Co. used WebCast to broadcast its quarterly  
conference call on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Edd Grigsby, vice president of Investor and Public Relations at  
Phillips Petroleum, said Internet carriage helps ``level the 
playing field'' for individual and institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference calls have been used as a tool for public companies  
to deliver comprehensive insight and timely information to 
analysts, investment bankers and major institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, has continued  
to scrutinize conference calls as a potential area for selective 
disclosure by public companies.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Celtic Lewis' Death Is Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Six years after Boston Celtics captain Reggie  
Lewis dropped dead shooting baskets, his widow is in court fighting 
for his reputation -- and the millions he could have made had he 
lived past 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis' malpractice suit, which began Monday before  
a jury, pits her husband's reputation against those of some of the 
city's most respected physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis contends the doctors misdiagnosed and mistreated  
her husband's fatal heart arrhythmia. The doctors say Lewis used 
cocaine and lied about it, making an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was to continue today.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the proper treatment had been given, Reggie Lewis would be  
here today,'' plaintiff attorney Robert Harley said. ``In all 
likelihood, (he) would be playing for the Celtics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis' suit names Dr. Gilbert Mudge, who led the  
specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, who were 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis is suing to recover money Lewis would have made had  
he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 million to more 
than $100 million. Her attorneys contend Lewis could have continued 
playing by wearing a defibrillator or taking medication, or could 
have held other positions like broadcaster or product pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dailey Jr., Mudge's attorney, said in his opening  
statement that Lewis lied to doctors about cocaine use until two 
weeks before he died, and the lack of full disclosure early in the 
treatment process made a proper diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the same as if I went in with a stomachache and  
never told my doctor I'd eaten a two-week-old meat loaf,'' Dailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has adamantly denied her husband ever used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	But Dailey said there was strong motivation to lie: Lewis'  
three-year, $9 million contract, which would have been nullified by 
illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``A disclosure that cocaine was being used would place that  
money in huge jeopardy,'' Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mudge finally was told of the possible cocaine use, he told  
Lewis he should be checked out further, but Lewis died before that 
was arranged, Dailey said. He added that Lewis also refused to 
follow the doctor's orders to stay away from certain physical 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Harley said claims of drug use, besides being false,  
are immaterial to the case. The doctors, Harley said, were 
responsible for providing the best care, regardless of the cause of 
the heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main participants in the case would comment 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	It began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a playoff  
game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New England 
Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed him 
with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concluded he did not have a normal heart,'' said Dr. Gerald  
Miley, one of the doctors who examined Lewis and the first witness 
to testify in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed there was a strong probability his life was at  
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists -- Mudge, of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis died while shooting hoops in the  
offseason at Brandeis University in Waltham, leaving a pregnant 
wife and thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a virus that could have caused inflammation of the 
heart, scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that had become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no conclusive evidence of cocaine, which could have been an 
alternative explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Miley, who testified Monday, said he did not test Lewis for  
cocaine because he had no reason to doubt the All-Star when he 
denied he used the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd known him for several years,'' said Miley, an internist at  
New England Baptist Hospital who performed preseason physicals for 
the Celtics. ``I had no reason not to believe him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 7-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, has said she tried, unsuccessfully, to 
get evidence of drug use excluded because the charges only 
``sensationalize and hide the true issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie, and how his life could have been saved,'' 
Harris-Lewis said Monday. ``When this is over, I hope and pray 
justice will finally be done.''

</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists -- Mudge, of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis died while shooting hoops in the  
offseason at Brandeis University in Waltham, leaving a pregnant 
wife and thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a virus that could have caused inflammation of the 
heart, scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that had become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no conclusive evidence of cocaine, which could have been an 
alternative explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Miley, who testified Monday, said he did not test Lewis for  
cocaine because he had no reason to doubt the All-Star when he 
denied he used the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd known him for several years,'' said Miley, an internist at  
New England Baptist Hospital who performed preseason physicals for 
the Celtics. ``I had no reason not to believe him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 7-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, has said she tried, unsuccessfully, to 
get evidence of drug use excluded because the charges only 
``sensationalize and hide the true issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie, and how his life could have been saved,'' 
Harris-Lewis said Monday. ``When this is over, I hope and pray 
justice will finally be done.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls Expeditions, Navigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 57,200  
of its 1999 Expeditions and Navigators because of a problem that 
could cause the wheels to fall off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of one accident with two minor injuries,'' Ford  
spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall of the two sport utility vehicles affects models with  
optional 17-inch chrome-finished steel wheels. Ford said some 
wheels might not have enough contact with the hub, which could 
cause vibration or result in the wheel and tire falling off. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers will tighten the wheels and install a label with  
tightening instructions on each wheel at no expense to owners.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Wonder, Worry About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The regular season ends tonight, and for the  
first time in a long while, the Chicago Bulls don't have much to 
show for it. Nothing they'd like to brag about, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no Central Division crown, no home-court advantage, not  
even a spot in the playoffs. Nope, it's lottery time for the 
defending champs. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the Bulls hadn't demolished their team after Michael  
Jordan retired? Say Scottie Pippen and the rest of the gang had 
stuck around for one more year, what then? Could Chicago have won 
the East and, possibly, a seventh title? 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just by looking at what's been going on, it's been kind of a  
neck-and-neck run with all of the other teams trying to position 
themselves. No question if we'd kept the team together we'd be 
defending our title again,'' said Dickey Simpkins, one of the few 
Bulls left over from last year's title team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was such a big part in the locker room. He made  
everyone around him better, and filling that hole would have been 
near impossible,'' general manager Jerry Krause said. ``We thought 
we could win a bunch of games, but winning a championship, we did 
not think we had the ability to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause isn't just defending himself. Remember the first time  
Jordan retired? The Bulls had Pippen, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, B.J. 
Armstrong, Horace Grant, John Paxson and Bill Cartwright, and they 
still got bounced in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now add five years to those legs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would have been probably the oldest team in the league.  
Older teams are more susceptible to injuries than younger teams,'' 
Krause said. ``Not only that, if we had given the contracts it 
would have taken to sign these guys, for the next several years we 
would have then been capped with the oldest team in the league and 
no way to get younger. 
</P>
<P>
	``And one of the worst things I think you can do is come fairly  
close and be old and capped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Jordan, the Bulls were showing signs of wear and tear.  
They barely got by Indiana in last year's Eastern Conference 
finals. Not even ``Judge Judy'' could have reconciled coach Phil 
Jackson and Krause. Dennis Rodman was getting weirder -- and that's 
tough to do. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bulls weren't exactly young, either, with Longley the  
only starter under 30. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Jordan hung up his sneakers in January, the Bulls  
decided it was best to gut the team and start over. The first to go 
was Pippen, who -- feeling underappreciated and underpaid -- was 
looking to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to come out west, so I don't know what would  
have happened,'' said Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
deal with the Rockets. ``I was looking to move on, and that's what 
I did. Whether or not we could have stayed together as a team and 
been successful is difficult to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not as if any team is lighting up the league. Indiana,  
anointed the favorite before the lockout even ended, has struggled. 
Miami lost to the Bulls over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other conference, the Utah Jazz appear vulnerable, the  
Rockets have yet to live up to their hype and the Los Angeles 
Lakers seem to need therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would have brought everyone back, who knows?'' said  
former Bull Jud Buechler, now with the Detroit Pistons. ``If there 
weren't any injuries to our team, I think we could have been in the 
mix for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the what-ifs don't really matter now. What's done is done,  
said Ron Harper, the only starter left in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look around and sit back and say, `I'd hoped we had  
our same team here,' '' he said. ``If we would have kept half our 
team here, I think we would have been there. But it didn't happen, 
so life goes on.''

<HEADLINE>  American Jet Downs Yugoslav Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO downed a Yugoslav MiG-29  
fighter jet in a dogfight over Serbia and struck a hydraulics 
factory, fuel storage depots and armored vehicles today, showing no 
letup in the bombings after President Clinton hinted at a pause in 
air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said a U.S. Air Force F-16 shot down a  
Yugoslav MiG-29 in a high-speed engagement about 2 1/2 miles over 
Serbian airspace. The Russian-designed plane is the best in the 
Yugoslav air force. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz of the German air  
force confirmed that an allied aircraft intercepted and shot down a 
Yugoslav aircraft in ``what pilots call an air-to-air fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also said its planes bombed a MiG-29 parked at an airfield.  
</P>
<P>
	While Yugoslav aircraft have been struck on the ground at  
various Serbian and Montenegrin airports -- even seen hiding under 
the tails of large commercial airplanes -- the Yugoslav air force 
has avoided confrontations with NATO warplanes for much of the air 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of the conflict -- March 26 -- American F-15C  
jets shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29s after they entered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Most traffic lights were still out today and many residents in  
Belgrade spent a second night in darkness, meanwhile, after the 
power grid was crippled by NATO bombings. Power was restored in 
some parts of the capital today, only to go out again. 
</P>
<P>
	Work crews had struggled Monday to restore electricity to much  
of Yugoslavia after NATO targeted two major power grids late 
Sunday. Power rationing was imposed in the central Serbian city of 
Kragujevac. 
</P>
<P>
	British Air Marshal John Day said the main focus of the latest  
operations were the Serb army and police forces in the field in 
Kosovo, including attacks on tanks, artillery and military 
vehicles. Allied firepower also struck fuel storage facilities and 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media reported that a NATO missile hit a bus Monday in  
Kosovo, killing 20 people and injuring 43. NATO spokesman Jamie 
Shea denied the accounts, saying today that allied commanders had 
checked all gun cameras from planes operating in the area and 
interviewed all pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can find no evidence of any NATO involvement in this  
incident,'' Shea said, suggesting the attack on a rural road near 
Pec that has been blamed on NATO may instead have been the result 
of an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's classic ambush country,'' Shea said of the area where  
Serb forces and rebels had had heavy skirmishes, adding that the 
bus did not ``seem to have been hit by a missile or a bomb from an 
aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's attacks came a day after Clinton said there could be ``a  
bombing pause'' in airstrikes if Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic 
accepted NATO demands for a troop pullout from Kosovo, the return 
of all refugees and deployment of an international security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to fly to Brussels, Belgium, today for an update on  
the air war from Secretary-General Javier Solana at NATO 
headquarters. He was then heading to Germany to meet with U.S. 
troops and some Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 after  
Milosevic rejected a Western plan to end the fighting in Kosovo, an 
ethnic Albanian-majority province of 2 million residents in Serbia, 
the main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 675,000 ethnic Albanians have poured out of Kosovo  
since the airstrikes began, leading NATO's top general to say today 
that Milosevic could succeed in his campaign of massive deportation 
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo despite the allied operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Klaus Naumann, a German four-star general and retiring head  
of NATO's military arm, said the air operation ``has slowed down 
the efforts of Milosevic's instruments for ethnic cleansing'' but 
``we cannot stop such a thing entirely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Milosevic's mass deportation campaign appears  
achievable,'' he said, adding that while Milosevic cannot defeat 
NATO, he might be able to completely force ethnic Albanians out. 
``I think if he really wants to get them out ... he may have a 
chance to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees streaming into Albania bore tales today of Serb forces  
demanding money from them and gunning down those who didn't comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees alleged the killings occurred Sunday night on a  
road in Studime, a village 20 miles northwest of Kosovo's capital 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In about a half-mile stretch, ``I saw bodies on the road and  
some others in the river,'' said Selvie Gorguri, crossing the 
border on a wagon. ``In the road there were many men. There were 
bodies in cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee accounts could not be independently confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	Kosova Press, the Kosovo Liberation Army's news agency, said  
about 100 civilians were killed by Serb soldiers in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	At a U.S. military base in Germany, three American servicemen  
were given a clean bit of health today after being freed Sunday by 
Yugoslav authorities following a peace mission by the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Checkups of the soldiers revealed fractured ribs and a broken  
nose, raising questions about how they were treated during their 
March 31 capture. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov called today for an  
immediate halt to the NATO airstrikes. Russia's special envoy to 
the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was in Washington today to 
discuss Russian efforts to broker a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance planes that have been conducting more than 600 bombing  
sorties a day were active today, with the Tanjug news agency 
reporting explosions in Pristina and blasts in Vucitrn, 
northwestern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacks also were reported on a factory in the central Serbian  
town of Valjevo, on Vranje near the border with Macedonia, 
Strazevica hill on the outskirts of Belgrade and the Batajnica 
region northwest of the city, where a military airfield is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities and towns across Yugoslavia were slowly restoring  
electricity and water after NATO jets blasted power plants in 
strikes aimed at disrupting the Yugoslav military. Serbia lost 70 
percent of its electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The power plant bombings targeted the Yugoslav army's command  
and control centers and demonstrated that the alliance can ``shut 
off the power system whenever we want,'' Shea said.

<HEADLINE> White House Welcomes Japan Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In 1963, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi  
-- still a student -- came to the nation's capital for what turned 
out to be a seminal event leading to his political career: a 
meeting with then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six years after that fateful trip, the White House  
welcomed Obuchi as guest of honor at a grand spring dinner, where 
the Japanese leader took a seat alongside his mentor's wife, Ethel 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only wonder at the inexplicable manner in which destiny  
plays out,'' remarked Obuchi Monday night, during his official 
toast before a crowd of 340 guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a pavilion on the South Lawn filled with signs of  
springtime, President Clinton said the graciousness Obuchi saw in 
Kennedy had indeed made a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it today reflected in your own decency and  
generosity,'' Clinton said in his toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Legendary pianist Van Cliburn, who has performed for every  
president since Harry Truman, enchanted the audience with his own 
selections including pieces by Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a national treasure,'' Clinton said of the virtuoso.  
</P>
<P>
	Guests enjoyed cocktails in the East Room before loading up into  
red trolleys that escorted them to the pavilion. An-indoor garden, 
created with the help of the National Park Service, awaited them. 
Azaleas and lugustrums bedecked the sides of the tent, while fresh 
lilacs and white peonies topped the tables. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted guests in a black and  
white sash presented to her by Mrs. Chizuko Obuchi over a 
floor-length black sequin Donna Karan gown. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Arthur Golden, who penned ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' Lynda  
Carter of ``Wonder Woman'' fame and actor Sidney Poitier peppered a 
guest list filled mostly with political officials and business 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the attendees was Saburo Kato, chairman of the Nippon  
Bonsai Association, who earlier in the day gave the two leaders a 
tutorial in horticulture. In the White House Blue Room, adorned for 
the occasion by Bonsai trees brought in from the National 
Arboretum, the pair listened attentively as Kato then explained the 
way the roots grow and the trees curve. Clinton also presented 
Obuchi with a 300-year-old tree as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi, sometimes likened to cold pizza by the Japanese media,  
displayed his warmth and charm to a receptive White House audience. 
Calling his trip a success, Obuchi set forth his major priorities 
for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only and most serious concern of my delegation and myself  
was whether my ceremonial first pitch at the Chicago Cubs game can 
reach the home plate,'' Obuchi said through a translator. ``My ball 
was nailed into Sammy Sosa's mitt without hitting the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador to Japan Tom Foley said that when Obuchi took  
office it was clear he was a ``nice guy,'' yet some questioned 
whether that was what Japan really needed. But the prime minister 
soon proved his political mettle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing very well,'' Foley said. ``He's enjoying the esteem  
of his own citizens as well as of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, as Obuchi himself noted, things have changed quite a bit  
since his 1963 visit to Washington. Back then, the prime minister 
paid out a hefty $1.50 a night for a room at the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, this time no charge,'' quipped the Japanese leader.

<HEADLINE>  'Nightingales' Nominated for Tony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What happens now to the Broadway plays and  
musicals that did -- and did not -- receive Tony Award nominations? 
</P>
<P>
	For some like ``Parade,'' which got nine nominations Monday,  
more than any other show, it won't make any difference. The musical 
about a real-life lynching in Georgia in 1913 closed in February 
after a short run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled, but a little sad,'' said Bernard Gersten,  
executive producer at Lincoln Center Theater, which helped present 
``Parade.'' ``We know it is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some shows gave up without a fight. ``Marlene,'' a look at film  
legend Marlene Dietrich, received two nominations including one for 
its star Sian Phillips. Yet it threw in the towel on Sunday, one 
day before the nominations came out. 
</P>
<P>
	For other shows, such as ``Not About Nightingales,'' ``The  
Lonesome West,'' and ``Side Man,'' still running and struggling at 
the box office, there's hope for a boost in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	All three gained best-play nominations and the impetus to carry  
on until at least June 6, when the winners are announced. 
``Nightingales,'' written by Tennessee Williams in 1938 but never 
done on Broadway until now, received a lift. The prison drama got 
six nominations including actor (Corin Redgrave) and director 
(Trevor Nunn) nods. 
</P>
<P>
	The other best-play nominee ``Closer'' will have to sell its  
status as a candidate for best play and not its actors. None of its 
four performers, including Natasha Richardson, got a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Amy's View,'' the star -- Oscar winner Judi Dench -- is the  
thing, not the play. She received a nomination, but the play 
didn't. Not that it matters. ``Amy's View'' is a hot ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	So are the season's two big revivals -- ``Death of a Salesman''  
and ``The Iceman Cometh.'' They are going head-to-head for the 
revival award and in the actor category where ``Salesman's'' Brian 
Dennehy faces ``Iceman's'' Kevin Spacey. It's a toss-up as to who 
will win -- but that makes for an exciting horse race. And tickets 
even harder to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Question marks hover over shows that didn't get major  
nominations or none at all. ``The Weir,'' Conor McPherson's small 
Irish pub drama was blanked. Now it will have fight for attention 
against plays that have nominations to sell. The same goes for 
``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm,'' which wasn't expecting any 
musical nominations -- and didn't get any. 
</P>
<P>
	``Footloose'' also failed to get a best-musical nod, which means  
no production number on the Tony telecast. The four minutes of 
national television exposure will benefit ``Fosse,'' a celebration 
of choreographer Bob Fosse; ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' 
another revue, and ``The Civil War,'' composer Frank Wildhorn's pop 
history pageant.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Take Control of PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The government is considering a  
temporary takeover of troubled Philippine Airlines to help it look 
for fresh capital and avoid being closed, President Joseph Estrada 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said the step would be a last resort if PAL chairman  
Lucio Tan is unable to raise the $200 million in new capital needed 
for its rehabilitation plan by an early June deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take over PAL if that is necessary,'' Estrada told  
reporters. ``The bottom line is, I want to see to it that PAL will 
continue flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the government would  
take over PAL's management but would not infuse money into the 
troubled carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada's administration has adopted a policy of not undertaking  
costly bailouts of beleaguered private and state-run companies. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL is mired in debts of more than $2.2 billion, of which more  
than two-thirds are owed to the U.S. and European credit agencies 
which helped finance the airline's ambitious but ill-timed fleet 
modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital infusion is a key element of a rehabilitation plan  
that also calls for cutting the airline's fleet to 22 planes from 
54 and slashing the labor force to about 3,000 from 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL submitted additional details of the plan on Tuesday, meeting  
a deadline set by Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission. The 
SEC had earlier rejected the plan for being too vague and failing 
to identify potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, PAL's new document did not identify any interested  
investors other than Tan and did not divulge the basis for its 
future income projections as sought by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC will review the filing and decide later whether it is  
sufficient. PAL's management must also meet a June 4 SEC deadline 
for it to come up with the $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay has said he will order the  
liquidation of PAL if the capital is not raised by the deadline and 
other key requirements of the rehabilitation plan are not met. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's major creditors, including the U.S. Export-Import  
bank and European export credit agencies, initially backed the plan 
but threatened to scuttle it after Tan reassumed direct management 
control of the airline last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The creditors have said they want PAL run by professional  
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, one of the country's richest men, owns 70 percent of the  
airline and has interests in banking, beer and tobacco. He was a 
major contributor to Estrada's campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan has said he is willing to organize a group of investors to  
raise the $200 million and pledged to provide half of the total 
himself, but the government is uncertain whether he can do so by 
the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan was set to fly to Germany to try to woo Deutsche Lufthansa  
AG to help recapitalize PAL, Trade and Industry Secretary Jose 
Pardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fallback for Tan's efforts, the government has begun talks  
with two other potential investors, Pardo said, but declined to 
give details.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Damage Worries Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The spiraling storms that ripped through  
Oklahoma and Kansas this week were large and ferocious enough to 
cause the worst-ever property losses from tornadoes, insurance 
experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	While the monetary cost of the tornadoes won't be known for  
several days, insurance companies anticipating drastic losses made 
their first overtures to the battered region Tuesday, sending in 
extra workers and setting up mobile offices to begin collecting 
damage reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major insurers were all preparing special  
catastrophe teams to travel to the area. Some claims adjusters have 
already arrived and are beginning to evaluate the damage, but many 
others stayed away for another day, awaiting a lull in the 
wrenching weather. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,000 houses in the Oklahoma City area were destroyed  
by the tornadoes, which ripped through the area Monday. Wichita, 
Kan., also sustained heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Property Claim Services unit of the New York-based Insurance  
Services Office Inc. said the damage could exceed the $1.3 billion, 
inflation-adjusted toll of a tornado that struck Xenia, Ohio in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The costliest storm on record was Hurricane Andrew, which caused  
about $16 billion in property losses in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In size and intensity, Monday's storm was stunning.  
</P>
<P>
	``We studied 37 mid-sized to large catastrophes last year,''  
said John Eager, director of claims services for the National 
Association of Independent Insurers. ``I don't remember any that 
were as devastating as this one seems to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many areas remained off-limits to insurance workers Tuesday  
afternoon as rescue workers searched for survivors. Travelers 
Property and Casualty, which plans to have a dozen workers in the 
damaged regions by this morning, said another 40 would arrive later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first step is to assess the whole area, and then we'll see  
what else we need to do,'' said Ray Stone, catastrophe manager for 
the insurance giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford, a Connecticut-based insurer, had some adjusters at  
work in Oklahoma on Tuesday, but also anticipated more arriving 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Erwin, a spokesman for the Insurance Information  
Institute, said insurance companies typically wait a bit before 
they fully mobilize after a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are initially in shock,'' he said. ``It's OK to let  
them be in shock for a while, then go in and help them rebuild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance professionals Tuesday offered a number of suggestions  
for people struggling with damaged homes and properties. First off, 
they said, local media can provide information on special hot lines 
or toll-free numbers set up by insurance providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said people should generally make only repairs that  
are absolutely necessary, and should photograph or videotape 
damaged property before fixing anything. Adjusters will want to see 
the full extent of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAII, the independent insurers' group, said people should  
keep detailed list of everything that is damaged or destroyed, and 
should keep receipts for any emergency repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates encouraged homeowners to check references  
before hiring any contractors, anticipating that natural disasters 
could bring out unscrupulous behavior from people hoping to prey on 
frayed emotions.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 39 in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes tore through Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday night, wiping out whole neighborhoods, killing at least 
39 people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,000 homes were destroyed in Oklahoma City alone,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it, the house started shaking and then the big  
rumble,'' said 74-year-old Katherine Burch, who hid in the bathroom 
of her southwest Oklahoma City home during the storm. ``Glass and 
everything flew in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped, debris flew and sirens blared as the twister  
moved from Chickasha to the heavily populated suburbs of Oklahoma 
City, 50 miles to the northeast. The tornado was part of a storm 
system that moved north into neighboring Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and emergency workers combed through the debris as  
darkness fell, searching for survivors while tornado warnings 
remained in effect. Crumpled cars littered two highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real chaotic,'' said Sharla Findley, director of  
community relations at Hillcrest Health Center in Oklahoma City. 
``We've gotten so many patients in I don't know who we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 39 deaths, 29 were in Oklahoma, 10 in Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were killed in Bridge Creek, about 30 miles  
southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the 
state Office of Emergency Management. He said four others died in 
Midwest City, a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City police said at least eight died there. Three  
deaths were reported in Moore, just south of Oklahoma City. Another 
death was reported at Norman Regional Hospital, and two more in 
suburban Del City. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Kansas, 10 were reported dead in Haysville and  
Wichita, about 150 miles due north. Nearly 100 people were reported 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see tonight,'' Battalion Chief  
Bob Thompson of the Sedgwick County Fire Department said. ``We'll 
probably find more deaths. I don't think we've seen the end of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the Midwest Regional Medical Center said it was  
treating at least 100 injured, as did the Hillcrest Health Center. 
Other hospitals were reporting injured as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear there are many more,'' Frizzell said of possible  
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado hit a hospital in Stroud, southwest of Tulsa. There  
were no immediate reports of injury from that storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got lost in a neighborhood I've driven around for 10 years  
because there's no landmarks anymore,'' said Sgt. Jody Suit of Del 
City. ``Out of one square mile, I'd say about one fourth of it is 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suit estimated 750 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in  
Del City. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed over a five-hour  
period beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. 
The National Severe Storms Lab in Norman said the tornado may have 
been a mile wide at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just the perfect type of atmosphere, very unstable and  
with wind shear, to create supercells,'' said National Weather 
Service forecaster David Andra. 
</P>
<P>
	He said forecasters expected the Oklahoma City twister to be  
categorized as at least F-4, the second-strongest tornado 
classification with winds between 207 mph and 260 mph. There were 
at least three tornado warnings still in effect at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and  
several other homes were damaged, said Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick 
County Emergency Preparedness Office. Irvin said multiple injuries 
were reported in both Wichita and Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris' mobile home was demolished with eight people  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris, 19, said. ``We all rolled in it.  
It was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the trailer were in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Karr, 13, said she saw the bay windows in her house  
cave in and the tornado swirling inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out at that point. I was scared for my life,''  
Courtney said. ``I've seen it on TV, but seeing it with my own 
eyes, tearing up my own home ... it is hard to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in Oklahoma City showed hundreds of destroyed  
homes. Heavy damage was reported in Moore, where rows of houses 
were destroyed and scores of trucks overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst storm devastation I have ever heard of,''  
Gov. Frank Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating declared a state of emergency and activated two elements  
of the National Guard to assist in Moore and Chickasha. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, natural gas leaked from several locations and power  
lines and piles of carpet were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson of Moore said as she looked  
toward where her home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson said she and others were watching the weather on  
television when they decided to run into the storm cellar after 
clouds rolled in and rain poured down. Sixteen people and four pets 
were in there with her. 
</P>
<P>
	All survived without injury, but: ``We opened up and everything  
was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Seymore sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck being used as  
a treatment center by a Red Cross volunteer in Moore. Injured 
people waited for ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything fell in on me,'' Ms. Seymore said of her home,  
where she hid in a closet. ``They couldn't hardly get me out of 
there. I couldn't get anybody to find me. I kept hollering `Help!' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Del City, Mary Pat Faris wore a nightgown at the high school  
where she waited for word about missing family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. I heard the popping and then I heard the trees  
crunching and then my house was gone,'' said Ms. Faris, who 
weathered the storm in her bathtub.

<HEADLINE> Racists Convicted of Murderous Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A jury that convicted two white  
supremacists of murder in a plot to overthrow the government and 
create a whites-only nation now must decide whether to recommend 
the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of nine blacks and three whites convicted Chevie Kehoe  
and Daniel Lee on Tuesday of racketeering, conspiracy and murder. 
The sentencing phase begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., and Lee, of Yukon, Okla., both 26,  
sat expressionless as they listened to the guilty verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said the men pursued their dream of an  
all-white republic by stockpiling military-style weapons, robbing 
several people and suffocating gun dealer William Mueller, his wife 
and her 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie and brother Cheyne Kehoe first entered the public eye in  
1997, following a videotaped shootout with police in Ohio. Cheyne 
Kehoe later helped authorities find his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated about 13 hours before returning the verdicts.  
They reviewed transcripts of two key prosecution witnesses -- 
Kehoe's mother, Gloria Kehoe, and brother Cheyne -- and they watched 
a videotape of the 1997 shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and brother both testified that Kehoe had described  
how he and Lee suffocated the three victims in the northwest 
Arkansas town of Tilly in January 1996 and threw their bodies into 
a river. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kehoe was the leader of the enterprise and  
recruited Lee to carry out his orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argued that, while Kehoe and Lee may have had  
offensive beliefs, they didn't act criminally on them or have the 
means to do what prosecutors claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlene Branch, the mother of murder victim Nancy Mueller, said  
she would testify during the sentencing phase. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to be a Christian and think of killing somebody,''  
she said. ``But I don't see any other answer. I don't want them out 
influencing anyone else.''

<HEADLINE> ESPN Sues Baseball Over Termination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN's 10th season of baseball could be its last  
because of a conflict with NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN sued major league baseball in federal court Tuesday to try  
to prevent termination of the network's regular-season contract, 
which has three years to run. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight season, baseball is refusing to allow  
the network to switch three September Sunday night games to ESPN2 
and run NFL games on the bigger-audience ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball has attempted to extort hundreds of million of  
dollars of economic concessions as the `price' for its consent,'' 
ESPN said in a 30-page complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Beeston, the chief aide to commissioner Bud Selig, sent  
ESPN a letter April 21 saying the sport was terminating its $88 
million-a-year deal with the network after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN asked for an injunction preventing baseball from ending the  
deal, an unspecified amount of money and a declaratory judgment 
forcing baseball to grant permission to switch the three telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Shira A.  
Scheindlin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, Beeston said baseball ``regrets  
that it was forced to terminate its contract with ESPN at the end 
of the season. We have had a good relationship with ESPN throughout 
this decade, and we still cling to hopes that it will continue into 
the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to make the switch to accommodate its $4.8 billion  
deal with the NFL. ESPN is available to about 76.2 million homes, 
while ESPN2 is available in 64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, baseball officials blocked the switch and, amidst  
threats of legal action by both sides, the broadcast rights were 
turned back to the teams involved. ESPN said baseball demanded 
about $30 million in financial concessions as a condition for 
giving its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers wound up missing Cal Ripken end his record  
consecutive-games streak and one of Mark McGwire's contests as he 
chased and passed Roger Maris' home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	When ESPN and baseball turned their attention to the matter in  
January, the network said the sport asked for an additional $350 
million for 1999-2002 plus a two-year extension at an annual 
threefold increase over the rights fee agreed to in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about nine hours of programming in the course  
of the almost 500 hours of dedicated MLB coverage we provide each 
year,'' said ESPN president George Bodenheimer. ``It's outrageous 
for baseball to attempt to terminate its agreement with ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to ESPN, the contract states that up to 10 baseball  
games each season can be pre-empted for ``events of significant 
interest''. 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball claims that ESPN is prohibited from  
pre-empting a game without its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	That condition cannot be ``unreasonably withheld,'' but baseball  
officials were unwilling to grant permission last year because they 
refused to take a back seat the NFL during pennant races. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said baseball agreed to move games to ESPN2 in the past --  
it did so last May in order to accommodate the NHL playoffs and 
will do it again for the NHL playoffs on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network also said the sport also has allowed games to  
be moved for World Cup soccer, U.S. Open and U.S. Senior Open golf, 
the College World Series and a Busch auto race. 
</P>
<P>
	But baseball wouldn't allow it last September -- ESPN's first  
year with the entire NFL Sunday night package. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they are willing to put the entire relationship at risk  
over three games that are the lowest-rated every single year,'' 
said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice president of programming. 
</P>
<P>
	September baseball games on ESPN averaged a 1.7 rating in 1997,  
about a quarter of the NFL's average in the same time slots last 
year. A cable rating point equals 994,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's deal, worth about $88 million a year, was originally for  
1996-2000. The regular-season contract was extended through 2002. 
Glover said that baseball has offered to renegotiate the deal for 
about $250 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute doesn't effect a separate four-year, postseason  
contract, which runs through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's conflicting games are scheduled for Sept. 12, 19,  
and 26, and two involve the team owned by Selig's family -- the 
Milwaukee Brewers. The games are Milwaukee at Colorado, San 
Francisco at San Diego and Houston at Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Reviews May Free INS Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Release may be near for some of the 3,500  
criminal immigrants caught in detention limbo: They've been held 
behind bars, in some cases for years, but they're not deportable 
because their homelands won't take them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris  
Meissner has ordered INS district offices to institute regular case 
reviews for all long-term detainees who cannot be repatriated 
because the United States lacks deportation agreements with their 
homelands. Most of these detainees, known in some circles as 
``lifers,'' are from Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
	The reviews will prompt releases, although the INS says it  
cannot estimate how many. 
</P>
<P>
	``INS' priority is keeping our communities safe, and no one will  
be released if he or she is deemed to pose a threat to public 
safety,'' Meissner said in a statement. ``Release decisions will 
consider criminal and immigration violations, history of violence 
while incarcerated, evidence of rehabilitation and ties to the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner's directive, announced late Friday, came as INS was  
contending with a high-profile protest in Miami. The parents of 
four Cuban ex-convicts in INS custody agreed Monday to end their 
47-day hunger strike protesting the indefinite detention of their 
sons and other long-term detainees after wrangling additional 
concessions from INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates welcomed the mandatory reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long overdue and important policy change,'' said  
Allyson Collins, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, which 
has strongly criticized INS' detention policies. ``The INS has been 
violating international human rights standards prohibiting 
arbitrary detention by holding these detainees indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration  
panel denounced the new policy, unfurled against the backdrop of 
continuing INS difficulties in housing an increasing detention 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is the INS' response to a shortage of detention beds  
always to release convicted criminals into our communities?'' said 
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``Is this the best the Clinton 
administration can do for the public it is supposed to serve?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration ``should be held accountable for every  
released deportable criminal who hurts another innocent victim,'' 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday: ``We  
will under no circumstances release anybody who we believe is a 
threat to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of a sweeping immigration law in 1996 placed new  
pressures on INS' detention network, which now houses 16,400 
people, triple the number of five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress mandated that INS detain virtually all noncitizens  
whose criminal convictions have made them deportable, ending the 
agency's discretion to release criminal immigrants believed to pose 
no risk. Lawmakers also broadened the definition of crimes 
triggering deportation and included provisions to cover convictions 
prior to the 1996 law's passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who visited the Miami protesters over  
the weekend, has pledged to seek reform of the 1996 law. So has 
Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who has particularly deplored the 
retroactivity rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent INS critic said the administration had little choice  
but to confront the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who is a shoplifter and can't go back to Vietnam -- I  
don't know, is it really sensible to keep that guy locked up 
forever?'' asked Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center 
for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration rates. 
``It is perfectly appropriate, I think, for us to answer that 
question, `Yes,' only for those people who pose threats to the 
community.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Eyes Web Smut Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telecommunications regulator  
said Tuesday that schools and libraries should have policies 
protecting children from smut and other inappropriate material on 
the Internet in order to receive federal money to subsidize access. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is pushing the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This idea makes a lot of sense,'' said Federal Communications  
Commission Chairman Bill Kennard, a Clinton appointee. ``As schools 
around the country think about how they are going to use technology 
in the classroom, they should also think about how to use it 
responsibly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Commerce Department urged the FCC, which  
oversees the Internet subsidies program, to require public schools 
and libraries to have such policies in place if they want to 
receive the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation pending in the Senate, however, would be tougher and  
require schools and libraries to install such computer software in 
return for receiving the subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Privacy Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contending many privacy laws have been  
overtaken by the information age, President Clinton urged Congress 
on Tuesday to bolster the rights of consumers when banks and other 
financial companies seek to share or sell information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said too many consumers ``have fallen victim to abusive  
practices'' and the rule changes would give them ``the tools and 
the confidence they need to fully participate in a thriving but 
highly complex 21st century economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal comes at a time when mergers and  
consolidations have melded financial institutions of all kinds and 
given banks unprecedented access to their customers' financial and 
medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should not have to worry that the results of your latest  
physical will be used to deny your application for a mortgage or a 
credit card,'' Clinton said in a ceremony in the old Executive 
Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic principle of his proposal would give Americans the  
right to decide whether information about them held by banks, 
insurance firms or securities companies is shared or sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that technology and competition have  
revolutionized the financial services industry,'' the president 
said. ``But many people ... don't have the knowledge to properly 
evaluate what is truly a dizzying array of options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also defended the Community Reinvestment Act  
against efforts of Senate Republicans to weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
	The act, which gives banks incentives to lend money in poor  
communities, has been in effect for 20 years. But Clinton said he 
is proud that more than 90 percent of the funds provided under the 
act have come in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not done anything to hurt bank profits, and we ought to  
stay with it,'' the president said of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan, which follows the outlines of legislation  
introduced in January by Sen. Paul Sarbanes D-Md., has these main 
components: 
</P>
<P>
	--Require banks and other financial institutions to tell  
consumers when they plan to share or sell their personal financial 
information, and give consumers the power to stop such a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restrict any sharing of medical information within a financial  
conglomerate. ``As banks and insurance firms merge, for example, 
consumers should not fear that the results of a physical exam could 
be used to make a credit decision,'' a White House statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require credit-card offers of low ``teaser rates'' to  
prominently disclose when those rates expire and how costly 
repayment can be if only minimum monthly payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the Securities and Exchange Commission budget by $16.5  
million in the coming fiscal year to boost the surveillance and 
prosecution of fraud in stock market and other financial 
transactions over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals were hailed by a number of consumer groups.  
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposals, if enacted, would go a long  
way to help inject honest and fair dealing into a marketplace that 
increasingly fails to meet the needs of modest and lower income 
consumers,'' said a joint statement by the Consumer Federation of 
America and the Consumers Union.

<HEADLINE> 5 Dead, Up to 100 Injured in Kansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The howling storm ripped the roof off the  
Karr home as the family huddled in terror and disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out at that point. I was scared for my life,''  
said 13-year-old Courtney Karr, who cowered with her 15-year-old 
sister, Jessie, and their parents as a killer tornado ripped their 
house apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were killed and up to 100 people were injured by  
Monday night's twister in Wichita and its southern suburb of 
Haysville. Tornadoes spawned by the same storm killed more people 
in the Oklahoma City area 150 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials surveyed the damage today and rescue workers  
went door-to-door looking for people who might be trapped or 
injured. Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County 
Fire Department, said there was a chance the death toll could rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've seen the end of it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Courtney watched in horror as the wind blew in the bay windows  
of her family's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen it on TV, but seeing it with my own eyes, tearing up  
my own home ... it is hard to explain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was trapped in the basement for about half an hour  
until the storm subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister cut a path 3 1/4 miles wide and 10 miles long through  
Haysville and southern Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the destruction was in Haysville, where parts of the  
older business district were demolished, including a bank, real 
estate company, chiropractor's office, a 10-unit apartment complex 
and several homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad tracks were uprooted and sheet metal was wrapped around  
trees near the ruins of the two-block long Norland Plastics plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Graves declared Sedgwick County a disaster area early  
today and ordered out the National Guard, which set up a temporary 
morgue and an aid station. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wichita, two trailer parks were devastated. Insulation and  
fragments of metal and lumber littered the ground. At one park, a 
yellow toddler's slide and a red Schwinn bicycle lay amid the 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Haysville resident Duane Moore and his wife, Vicky, hid with  
their three dogs in a neighbor's storm shelter, but the wind yanked 
the door off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen anything yet; I just noticed I don't have a  
house,'' Ms. Moore said as she, her husband and the dogs walked out 
of their shattered neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Launches Asthma Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton kicked off a national  
asthma screening program Tuesday at an inner-city elementary 
school, hoping to draw attention to a dramatic rise in children 
with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 schools, shopping malls, community centers and  
health fairs offered free screenings as part of the program to 
increase detection of asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 14 million and 15 million people have the disease but  
many don't realize that their wheezing, coughing and breathing 
problems are caused by it. And asthma is the leading cause of 
hospitalization for children and one of the leading reasons why 
children miss school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to pay particular attention to poor families, because  
it is the children of the poor who suffer disproportionately from 
this disease,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and  
Immunology, black children suffer the most from asthma. Although 
their risk of contracting it is only slightly higher than for other 
children, black children are more than four times more likely to 
die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton called on Congress to enact a White House proposal  
to help fight asthma. The Department of Health and Human Services 
wants to spend $50 million for state grants that would identify and 
treat poor children served by Medicaid who have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of children with asthma has doubled to about six  
million in the last 15 years, said Dr. Talal Nsouli, Washington 
chairman of the ACAAI's screening program. The rate for children 
under age five increased 160 percent within the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Asthma can be controlled with medication but early detection and  
constant, appropriate treatment are the best ways to prevent asthma 
statistics from increasing further, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also unveiled a public service campaign to promote  
a study released by the Environmental Protection Agency that says 
exposure to second-hand smoke considerably worsens asthma for up to 
a million children. It also increases the chance among young 
children to contract pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis and 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton encouraged parents who smoke to avoid doing so  
around their children or in their homes. She said she has 
implemented a non-smoking policy at the White House, which has led 
to some ``tickly'' situations involving visiting kings, prime 
ministers and other heads of state who tried to light up a 
cigarette inside but were shooed outdoors instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that you'll think of your house, the White House, as an  
example perhaps for your own house,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Tornado Leaves Areas in Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The sun was shining and the wind was  
picking up Tuesday over Lake Shore Trailer Park, where a small, 
manmade lake was brimming with the remnants of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	A mobile home floated upside down in the nameless lake. Wreckage  
drifted past. Clothing hung on trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Rohlman picked up clothing near his trailer, which had  
been squashed by the roof of his neighbor's trailer home. He had 
gone to a bookstore a few minutes before the tornado hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gone there I might not be around,'' he said.  
``Boy, a lot of that stuff is buried. What a mess. I'm going to 
have to dig it out piece by piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado did serious damage in Kansas, killing five people  
and injuring 100 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Spawned by the same storm system Monday that produced even  
deadlier tornadoes across the state line in Oklahoma, the Kansas 
tornado cut a path 12 miles long and 3 miles wide in southern 
Wichita and suburban Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' Eric Peterson, a recent transplant from  
Seattle, said of the ruin that included a tree thrown into his 
bedroom in Haysville, just south of Wichita. ``I have been in 
typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, but this tops 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard troops joined about 200 state and local police in  
the area and dogs were used to search the wreckage for possible 
additional victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and his wife, Julie, grabbed their 5-year-old son  
before the twister struck and ran to a shelter. Their one-story, 
rented home was still standing, despite a damaged roof. Their boy's 
wooden swing set had been picked up and hurled into a yard four 
houses away. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 150 houses, 27 businesses and three churches were  
damaged or destroyed in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the lake, Misty and David Seeber walked along a shore  
with trees stripped bare, picking through the pile of broken wood 
and twisted metal that used to be their home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her 22nd birthday on Tuesday. The couple found some  
wedding pictures and her wedding dress and were looking for David's 
wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find his wedding ring, we'll be happy,'' she said.  
``We're very lucky somebody's watching over us.''

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw Is Top Pick in WNBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Chamique Holdsclaw, the WNBA just might have  
its version of Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a four-time All-American who led Tennessee to three  
consecutive national titles, was the No. 1 pick by the Washington 
Mystics in Tuesday's WNBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the player of the present and the player of the future  
for our league,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said. ``Her eventual 
appeal could rival what Michael Jordan was able to do over his long 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll have an appeal that players in our league haven't quite  
had yet in terms of reaching a new groups of fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a two-time national player of the year, was selected  
first even though pro players were from the defunct American 
Basketball League were also included in the draft. Holdsclaw was 
the only college player drafted in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 6-foot-2 star goes to a team that won just three of 30  
games last season, she is expected to immediately turn around the 
Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw averaged 21.3 points and 8.1 rebounds last season for  
the Lady Vols, who were upset by Duke in the NCAA regional finals 
in March. She is Tennessee's career scoring leader, surpassing 
Allan Houston, with 3,025 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Former ABL player Yolanda Griffith was the No. 2 pick, going to  
the Sacramento Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah then chose center Natalie Williams, the ABL's player of the  
year in '98 who averaged 21 points and 11.6 rebounds per game. Los 
Angeles picked forward Delisha Milton of Portland, a member of the 
1998 World Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Former San Jose Laser guard Jennifer Azzi went to Detroit with  
the fifth picks and forward Crystal Robinson was chosen by the New 
York Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA drafted 50 players in the four-round draft -- 35 from  
the ABL, 12 from college and three from international teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With the influx of the ABL players, many of them Olympians or  
All-Americans, Ackerman called it the ``deepest draft in modern-day 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft was postponed a week because of a labor dispute  
between the players and league. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and players union agreed to allow three ABL players  
on each of the 10 established teams and five each on the expansion 
teams in Minnesota and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA begins its third 10-week season on June 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw will join a Washington team that finished at the  
bottom of the league last season and be paired with former Lady Vol 
Nikki McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the women's side, people most compare her to Cheryl Miller,  
who had an all-around game as Chamique does,'' Ackerman said. ``On 
the men's game, I hear her compared to Scottie Pippen. She's very 
agile, a good defensive player who can score, pass, has great court 
sense and is incredibly competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw will be coached by Nancy Darsch, a former Tennessee  
assistant in the mid-1980s. Darsch was fired after two seasons with 
the New York Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach (Pat) Summitt really wanted me to play for Nancy,'' said  
Holdsclaw, a New Yorker. ``Washington is where my grandmother 
wanted me to play. I'm kind of glad I didn't go to New York because 
I don't know if I could handle all the pressure and friends and 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, the 1998 ABL defensive player of the year, averaged  
17.2 points and 12.3 rebounds for the Chicago Condors. She's 
looking forward to playing with Sacramento's Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruthie is a great defender and a great player,'' Griffith  
said. ``Once we learn to play with each other, we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expansion teams picked seventh and eighth: The  
Minnesota Lynx took guard Tonya Edwards of the two-time champion 
Columbus Quest, and the Orlando Miracle selected forward Tari 
Phillips of the Colorado Xplosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte followed with guard Dawn Staley, formerly of the  
Philadelphia Rage; Phoenix went for guard Edna Campbell of the 
Colorado Xplosion; Cleveland picked center Chasity Melvin of the 
Rage; and Houston selected the only international player in the 
first round, Natalia Zassoulskaia, a two-time MVP of the 
Euroleague, from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Workers Get No Respect on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are the Rodney Dangerfields of broadcast  
television: politicians, postal workers and government employees. 
They get no respect. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a new report, postal workers tend to be portrayed  
as lazy and inept -- like Cliff Clavin, the blowhard mail carrier 
perched on a barstool at ``Cheers.'' Politicians like Boss Hogg on 
``The Dukes of Hazzard'' are stereotyped as greedy and out for No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers and teachers, however, are depicted more  
positively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan research  
organization here, came up with these findings after examining how 
prime-time entertainment shows on broadcast television over the 
last four decades have depicted elected officials, law enforcers, 
teachers and people who work for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected officials had the worst image of any government-related  
occupation shown on television for the entire time period examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on 1,234 prime-time series episodes from  
1955 through 1998 on ABC, CBS and NBC, and the years during that 
period after Fox was launched. 
</P>
<P>
	In analyzing shows airing from 1955 through 1986, 51 percent of  
the politicians played negative roles compared with 40 percent who 
played positive ones, while 9 percent of the portrayals were 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians' roles have become more neutral in the past few  
years. For shows airing between 1992 and 1998, only 31 percent were 
depicted negatively, 22 percent positively and 47 percent 
neutrally. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with other TV occupations, elected officials -- taken as  
a group -- contained a majority of bad guys, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some TV politicians were depicted as honorable, such as actor  
Fess Parker in the TV version of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' 
a comedy show that ran from 1962 to 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the mid-1970s, the report said, TV focused on either  
the dark side of political life -- evil politicians allied with 
business or criminal interests -- or as foolish bumblers in humorous 
roles, such as Boss Hogg, a corrupt and blustery county 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Spin City,'' fictional New York Mayor Randall Winston is  
portrayed as a scatterbrained bungler, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil servants, particularly postal workers like Clavin or the  
abrasive Newman on ``Seinfeld,'' are rarely portrayed in a positive 
light, the report said. Instead, they are depicted as ``robotic 
paper shufflers or abrasive malcontents'' too lazy to serve the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ``Seinfeld'' episode, Newman uses a government mail truck  
to haul recyclables from New York to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service isn't insulted by the Clavin or Newman  
characters, said spokesman Mark Saunders. ``We take it in stride. 
It's meant to be humorous. We're not offended.'' A 1998 AP poll 
found that almost three-fourths of Americans believe the service is 
doing an excellent or good job. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alvin Poussaint, professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard  
Medical School, said there is a serious side to these unflattering 
images. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad thing if you consider that most people,  
particularly children, get their impressions about the world and 
jobs and role models from television,'' he said. ``If they see 
mostly negative images of public officials or politicians that may 
turn them off from those kinds of jobs.'' Or, it could discourage 
them from voting, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In an episode of ``The X-Files,'' FBI agent Fox Mulder -- often  
portrayed as a hero -- discovers a secret government conspiracy to 
implant a deadly biotoxin in stolen money to test its effects on 
the public. That, the report said, depicts government as a corrupt 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public officials and public employees are the Rodney  
Dangerfields of TV entertainment,'' said S. Robert Lichter, the 
center's president. ``They don't get no respect. Basically, 
bureaucrats are there to pester you and politicians are there to 
steal your money and generally corrupt the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Partnership for Trust in Government, an advocacy group  
devoted to restoring the public's confidence in government, paid 
for the study.

Basketball League were also included in the draft. Holdsclaw was 
the only college player drafted in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 6-foot-2 star goes to a team that won just three of 30  
games last season, she is expected to immediately turn around the 
Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw averaged 21.3 points and 8.1 rebounds last season for  
the Lady Vols, who were upset by Duke in the NCAA regional finals 
in March. She is Tennessee's career scoring leader, surpassing 
Allan Houston, with 3,025 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Former ABL player Yolanda Griffith was the No. 2 pick, going to  
the Sacramento Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah then chose center Natalie Williams, the ABL's player of the  
year in '98 who averaged 21 points and 11.6 rebounds per game. Los 
Angeles picked forward Delisha Milton of Portland, a member of the 
1998 World Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Former San Jose Laser guard Jennifer Azzi went to Detroit with  
the fifth picks and forward Crystal Robinson was chosen by the New 
York Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA drafted 50 players in the four-round draft -- 35 from  
the ABL, 12 from college and three from international teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With the influx of the ABL players, many of them Olympians or  
All-Americans, Ackerman called it the ``deepest draft in modern-day 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft was postponed a week because of a labor dispute  
between the players and league. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and players union agreed to allow three ABL players  
on each of the 10 established teams and five each on the expansion 
teams in Minnesota and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA begins its third 10-week season on June 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw will join a Washington team that finished at the  
bottom of the league last season and be paired with former Lady Vol 
Nikki McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the women's side, people most compare her to Cheryl Miller,  
who had an all-around game as Chamique does,'' Ackerman said. ``On 
the men's game, I hear her compared to Scottie Pippen. She's very 
agile, a good defensive player who can score, pass, has great court 
sense and is incredibly competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw will be coached by Nancy Darsch, a former Tennessee  
assistant in the mid-1980s. Darsch was fired after two seasons with 
the New York Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach (Pat) Summitt really wanted me to play for Nancy,'' said  
Holdsclaw, a New Yorker. ``Washington is where my grandmother 
wanted me to play. I'm kind of glad I didn't go to New York because 
I don't know if I could handle all the pressure and friends and 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, the 1998 ABL defensive player of the year, averaged  
17.2 points and 12.3 rebounds for the Chicago Condors. She's 
looking forward to playing with Sacramento's Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruthie is a great defender and a great player,'' Griffith  
said. ``Once we learn to play with each other, we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expansion teams picked seventh and eighth: The  
Minnesota Lynx took guard Tonya Edwards of the two-time champion 
Columbus Quest, and the Orlando Miracle selected forward Tari 
Phillips of the Colorado Xplosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte followed with guard Dawn Staley, formerly of the  
Philadelphia Rage; Phoenix went for guard Edna Campbell of the 
Colorado Xplosion; Cleveland picked center Chasity Melvin of the 
Rage; and Houston selected the only international player in the 
first round, Natalia Zassoulskaia, a two-time MVP of the 
Euroleague, from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Chicago's Treasurer Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Over and over, the jurors heard the tape: an  
angry Miriam Santos, Chicago's city treasurer, blurting to a 
securities firm that it was ``time to belly up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outburst proved Santos' undoing in her extortion and fraud  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most damaging,'' said Clayton Quinn, a member of  
the federal jury that convicted Santos on Monday of attempting to 
extort campaign funds and five counts of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos,43, faces up to 33 months in prison when sentenced in  
July. Her felony conviction mandates her removal from office, 
according to state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors accused Santos, a Democrat, of pressuring  
seven brokers who oversee the investment of $2.5 billion in city 
funds to donate thousands of dollars to her failed attorney general 
campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers said she threatened to stop doing business with them  
unless they paid up, and ordered them cut off when none donated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors found her guilty of attempted extortion of only Fuji  
Securities, which had a tape recording of an angry conversation 
with Santos. The tape was played repeatedly over the course of the 
two-week trial, and Quinn said it took center stage in the jury's 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tape, Santos demands the company donate $10,000 to her  
campaign for attorney general, telling a broker it was ``time to 
belly up'' and that ``this is no choice.'' Fuji routinely taped its 
phone calls as a precaution in case questions arose concerning the 
way a securities trade was handled. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos and her attorneys said her words on the tape may have had  
a rough edge, but were not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos was also convicted of illegally directing employees to  
perform campaign work, but acquitted of four other attempted 
extortion counts for allegedly trying to shake down other 
companies.

<HEADLINE> No Kosovo Peace Breakthrough So Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia's diplomatic offensive to bring peace  
to Kosovo is getting an unexpected boost from President Clinton, 
whose top foreign policy advisers met for a second day today with 
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is offering both a pause in the deadly NATO  
bombing of Yugoslavia and negotiations on a peacekeeping force for 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the offer Monday with softer rhetoric than he has  
used since NATO began its air campaign March 24. The message is one 
that Chernomyrdin can take to Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, with 
a little more leverage than he had on his two previous rounds of 
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. officials said no breakthrough is expected,  
Chernomyrdin met for an hour today with Vice President Al Gore, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, national security adviser 
Sandy Berger and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott following 
a 2 1/2-hour meeting Clinton held with Chernomyrdin on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Ambassador Yury Ishakov telephoned Gore's office at 8:45  
a.m. to request the meeting, a spokesman for the vice president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Chernomyrdin was due to meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said  
after today''s meeting that ``we continue to have constructive 
discussions'' but no breakthrough appeared imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, the Senate today set aside Sen. John McCain's  
effort to give President Clinton unsought authority to use ``all 
necessary force'' to win in Yugoslavia. McCain bitterly accused the 
president of being ``prepared to lose a war'' rather than consider 
ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in the Republican-led chamber was 78-22, approving a  
leadership motion to table -- or set aside -- McCain's measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, was flying to NATO headquarters in Brussels,  
Belgium, tonight for an update on the air war from NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana and then to Germany to meet with 
U.S. troops involved in humanitarian efforts and with some Kosovo 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is accompanying Clinton and may meet in Bonn with the  
foreign ministers of the G-8 nations, those from Britain, Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said it is ``fundamentally  
wrong'' to conclude that what Clinton is now saying is ``somehow 
new or a softening of the position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader who ran against  
Clinton in 1996, urged Clinton in a letter not to end the conflict 
without a NATO victory. Dole said that meant ``a defeated and 
deposed Milosevic, the withdrawal or destruction of all Serbian 
force in Kosovo and a settlement providing for the safe return of 
all Kosovar Albanians to their former homes under the protection of 
a NATO force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from the 90-minute Oval Office meeting Monday night,  
Chernomyrdin said, ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution.'' He 
did not elaborate, except to say that he and the president 
discussed ``the circumstances and the conditions'' under which NATO 
would pause in its air assault on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not trying to drag this out,'' Clinton said before  
meeting first with Chernomyrdin and then with the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, who secured the weekend release of three U.S. soldiers who 
had been held captive in Yugoslavia for 32 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday held fast to the four key U.S. requirements  
for ending the conflict in Yugoslavia: 
</P>
<P>
	--That Milosevic withdraw more than 40,000 Serb troops currently  
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Safe return of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian  
refugees uprooted from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Acceptance by Belgrade of an international security force to  
protect the refugees and Serb and other minorities in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restoration of the self-rule for the Albanians who, until a  
year ago, made up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, though, gestures of compromise surfaced in the  
president's remarks at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi, who on a visit here pledged $200 million in 
assistance for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	On the one hand, Clinton rejected Jackson's demand that NATO  
should end its bombing and that continuing the attacks after the 
soldiers were freed showed ``an arrogance of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Release of the three Americans is not reason enough, Clinton  
argued. Milosevic must reverse what he has done to the ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president did offer a pause in the bombing, provided  
Milosevic accepts his demands and begins to pull out the Serbs 
troops in a way that shows he means to withdraw virtually all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	That reinforces a similar offer made by the United States and  
the NATO allies at their summit meeting here last month to suspend 
the bombing if Milosevic presented a verifiable scheme to both 
withdraw Serb troops and paramilitary units and reversed what the 
administration and much of the world has denounced as ``ethnic 
cleansing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a clear commitment to let the Kosovars come  
home,'' Clinton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort, meanwhile, to at least win Russia's support,  
Clinton said the peacekeeping force that would move into Kosovo 
should be endorsed by the United Nations and be broad enough to 
include Russians, Ukrainians and troops from other countries the 
Serbs were inclined to trust. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO ``has to be part of it,'' but otherwise ``there is  
room for discussion within limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic so far has insisted he would accept a force from  
Russia and other friendly or neutral countries that also is very 
lightly armed. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration leaders said Clinton had not softened U.S.  
conditions for ending the airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which in 
41 days have failed to break Milosevic's will. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly what we've said all along,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Reviews May Free INS Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Release may be near for some of the 3,500  
criminal immigrants caught in detention limbo: They've been held 
behind bars, in some cases for years, but they're not deportable 
because their homelands won't take them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris  
Meissner has ordered INS district offices to institute regular case 
reviews for all long-term detainees who cannot be repatriated 
because the United States lacks deportation agreements with their 
homelands. Most of these detainees, known in some circles as 
``lifers,'' are from Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
	The reviews will prompt releases, although the INS says it  
cannot estimate how many. 
</P>
<P>
	``INS' priority is keeping our communities safe, and no one will  
be released if he or she is deemed to pose a threat to public 
safety,'' Meissner said in a statement. ``Release decisions will 
consider criminal and immigration violations, history of violence 
while incarcerated, evidence of rehabilitation and ties to the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner's directive, announced late Friday, came as INS was  
contending with a high-profile protest in Miami. The parents of 
four Cuban ex-convicts in INS custody agreed Monday to end their 
47-day hunger strike protesting the indefinite detention of their 
sons and other long-term detainees after wrangling additional 
concessions from INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates welcomed the mandatory reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long overdue and important policy change,'' said  
Allyson Collins, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, which 
has strongly criticized INS' detention policies. ``The INS has been 
violating international human rights standards prohibiting 
arbitrary detention by holding these detainees indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration  
panel denounced the new policy, unfurled against the backdrop of 
continuing INS difficulties in housing an increasing detention 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is the INS' response to a shortage of detention beds  
always to release convicted criminals into our communities?'' said 
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``Is this the best the Clinton 
administration can do for the public it is supposed to serve?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration ``should be held accountable for every  
released deportable criminal who hurts another innocent victim,'' 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday: ``We  
will under no circumstances release anybody who we believe is a 
threat to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of a sweeping immigration law in 1996 placed new  
pressures on INS' detention network, which now houses 16,400 
people, triple the number of five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress mandated that INS detain virtually all noncitizens  
whose criminal convictions have made them deportable, ending the 
agency's discretion to release criminal immigrants believed to pose 
no risk. Lawmakers also broadened the definition of crimes 
triggering deportation and included provisions to cover convictions 
prior to the 1996 law's passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who visited the Miami protesters over  
the weekend, has pledged to seek reform of the 1996 law. So has 
Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who has particularly deplored the 
retroactivity rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent INS critic said the administration had little choice  
but to confront the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who is a shoplifter and can't go back to Vietnam -- I  
don't know, is it really sensible to keep that guy locked up 
forever?'' asked Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center 
for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration rates. 
``It is perfectly appropriate, I think, for us to answer that 
question, `Yes,' only for those people who pose threats to the 
community.''

<HEADLINE> GM's April U.S. Sales Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. was the only big automaker  
whose U.S. sales dropped in April, with purchases of its cars and 
light trucks off 4 percent compared with a robust performance in 
the same month of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker reported Tuesday its car sales  
fell nearly 5 percent while sales of its pickups, sport utility 
vehicles, vans and minivans dropped 4 percent. GM's biggest foreign 
and domestic competitors reported sales increases Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's performance was slightly worse than analysts expected. Yet  
despite the year-to-year decline, GM managed to edge its U.S. 
market share just over the 30 percent barrier for the first time in 
seven months -- to 30.4 percent from 29.5 percent in March. For the 
year through April, GM's share is at 29.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is fighting to get back above 30 percent for all of  
1999 because its North American production empire is geared to 
operate profitably at that level. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales chief, said the  
year-to-year sales comparison was skewed by GM's successful 
``loyalty coupon'' discount campaign that boosted sales in April 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It meant that this past April we were playing catch-up,''  
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year GM played down the coupons' effect, saying they were  
used in only 2.5 percent of its April retail sales. Ford and the 
then-Chrysler Corp. quickly matched GM's discounts and generated 
sales gains a year ago and again last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's biggest problem is a product portfolio that remains far  
heavier in cars than trucks as the U.S. market continues its 
decade-long shift toward pickups, SUVs and minivans. Trucks also 
are far more profitable than cars, which are selling at the levels 
they are only because of deep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a margin standpoint it's obvious: GM continues to lag  
DaimlerChrysler and Ford in profitability,'' said analyst Richard 
Hilgert of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``It also hampers their ability to gain 
market share while DaimlerChrysler and Ford are able to manufacture 
more trucks as a percentage of their output.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire industry, sales were up 4 percent last month. For  
the first time in many months, car sales increased at a 
fractionally higher rate than truck sales -- both were up about 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was foreign automakers that made the biggest percentage  
gains last month -- at the expense of the domestics. European 
automakers improved 15 percent, while Asian automakers posted a 13 
percent gain. GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit together 
were up only 1 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts told reporters he was optimistic about GM's progress. He  
noted that the redesigned version of GM's best-selling vehicle, its 
full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup, remained in high demand and was 
putting the company on pace for a record-setting year in truck 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're building momentum,'' he said. ``We are putting more  
capacity into place. Our sales lead over our domestic competition 
is the biggest it's been since before the work stoppage last year, 
which had a crippling effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's market share plummeted last summer when the United Auto  
Workers virtually shut down its North American production with two 
parts plant strikes. For months afterward, the automaker cited the 
strikes' effect on its inventories for its lagging market share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take a position from here forward of no  
excuses,'' Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Privacy Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contending many privacy laws have been  
overtaken by the information age, President Clinton urged Congress 
on Tuesday to bolster the rights of consumers when banks and other 
financial companies seek to share or sell information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said too many consumers ``have fallen victim to abusive  
practices'' and the rule changes would give them ``the tools and 
the confidence they need to fully participate in a thriving but 
highly complex 21st century economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal comes at a time when mergers and  
consolidations have melded financial institutions of all kinds and 
given banks unprecedented access to their customers' financial and 
medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should not have to worry that the results of your latest  
physical will be used to deny your application for a mortgage or a 
credit card,'' Clinton said in a ceremony in the old Executive 
Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic principle of his proposal would give Americans the  
right to decide whether information about them held by banks, 
insurance firms or securities companies is shared or sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that technology and competition have  
revolutionized the financial services industry,'' the president 
said. ``But many people ... don't have the knowledge to properly 
evaluate what is truly a dizzying array of options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also defended the Community Reinvestment Act  
against efforts of Senate Republicans to weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
	The act, which gives banks incentives to lend money in poor  
communities, has been in effect for 20 years. But Clinton said he 
is proud that more than 90 percent of the funds provided under the 
act have come in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not done anything to hurt bank profits, and we ought to  
stay with it,'' the president said of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking  
Committee, maintained his opposition to the reinvestment law 
Tuesday as the Senate began debate on sweeping legislation to let 
banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies get deeper into each 
other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty serious about'' opposing the law, Gramm told  
reporters. ``I killed the bill (over) it last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has threatened to veto the legislation in its  
current form because it would not require banks to have 
satisfactory community reinvestment ratings from the government in 
order to merge with other financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan, which follows the outlines of legislation  
introduced in January by Sen. Paul Sarbanes D-Md., has these main 
components: 
</P>
<P>
	--Require banks and other financial institutions to tell  
consumers when they plan to share or sell their personal financial 
information, and give consumers the power to stop such a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restrict any sharing of medical information within a financial  
conglomerate. ``As banks and insurance firms merge, for example, 
consumers should not fear that the results of a physical exam could 
be used to make a credit decision,'' a White House statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require credit-card offers of low ``teaser rates'' to  
prominently disclose when those rates expire and how costly 
repayment can be if only minimum monthly payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the Securities and Exchange Commission budget by $16.5  
million in the coming fiscal year to boost the surveillance and 
prosecution of fraud in stock market and other financial 
transactions over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals were hailed by a number of consumer groups.  
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposals, if enacted, would go a long  
way to help inject honest and fair dealing into a marketplace that 
increasingly fails to meet the needs of modest and lower income 
consumers,'' said a joint statement by the Consumer Federation of 
America and the Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee adopted a proposal in March that  
would restrict the sharing of certain information among affiliated 
banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Under the 
provision, customers' transaction data, such as checking account 
history, still would be allowed to be shared among affiliated 
financial companies.

<HEADLINE> Ump Danley Leaves Hospital for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Umpire Kerwin Danley was released from a  
hospital Tuesday evening and returned to his home in Phoenix to see 
his family doctor and get more tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Danley left the Cincinnati Reds' 4-3 victory over the Arizona  
Diamondbacks on Monday night after he became light-headed. He 
walked off the field after the second inning and was sent to Good 
Samaritan Hospital after a test found he had high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew chief Ed Montague said Danley hadn't felt well for about a  
week. He said the medical tests found nothing seriously wrong with 
Danley and that the problem could be an inner-ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt better today,'' Montague said, shortly after  
Danley was released. 
</P>

	Montague took over behind home plate on Monday night, when the  
last seven innings were played with three umpires. C.B. Bucknor 
flew to Cincinnati to take Danley's place for the last two games of 
the series. 
</P>

	Danley, 37, worked his first National League game in 1992. He

<HEADLINE> GAO Says Y2K Costs Not Being Tracked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some federal agencies receiving emergency  
funding to help them fix Year 2000 computer problems are not 
keeping accurate track of how they spend the money, according to 
congressional auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, in a report issued this week,  
said that of 24 major federal agencies surveyed, only seven 
reported separately tracking Y2K costs for the fiscal years 1996 
through 1998. Five tracked only some costs, while nine did not keep 
specific Y2K spending records and three did not respond to the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and  
Budget, said Y2K spending was one of the most closely monitored 
processes in the federal government and ``we are absolutely 
confident that agencies are keeping track of their spending and 
their progress and reporting it appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in the 1996-98 period, the agencies  
apparently spent less than half the $7.5 billion that the 
administration has said will be needed to fix the millennium bug. 
But it said that because of the lack of separate tracking, these 
costs can only be regarded as estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who requested the  
report, said he was startled by the accounting methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last fall the administration was adamant that federal agencies  
would not be ready for 2000 without an emergency cash infusion for 
Y2K readiness,'' he said. ``But their spending patterns don't match 
their rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Congress approved an emergency spending bill that  
provided $2.25 billion for civilian agencies and $1.1 billion for 
the Defense Department to ensure there will be no disruptions from 
the glitch that may prompt some computers to mistake the year 2000 
for 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, the 24 agencies reported that their estimated Y2K  
costs for fiscal 1999 would be $2.8 billion, and $1.1 billion in 
fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the spending will go toward renovating and testing  
equipment, while agencies said they also planned to use funds for 
outreach activities, contingency planning and replacing computer 
hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report said Treasury -- with Agriculture and State one of  
the three agencies not providing information -- told the OMB that 
$92 million of its $253 million in Y2K funding was for non-Y2K 
information technology investments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the OMB's Ricci said that was money for IRS modernization  
that Congress took out of a fiscal 1999 spending package with 
directions to Treasury to use money from emergency funding. 
``Treasury was doing exactly what Congress was telling it to do.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban May Have Defected in Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Six Cubans missed the flight home today after  
the game with the Baltimore Orioles, and a U.S. law enforcement 
official said at least one person was being processed for possible 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington  
denied any Cubans had defected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defectors,'' spokesman Luis Fernandez told The  
Associated Press. ``I have no information that there are any 
defectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said six Cubans, who are former baseball players,  
overslept and missed their plane, which left at 6 a.m. without 
them. He said they were planning to catch another flight home today 
or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they overslept and missed their plane,'' he  
said, adding they ``were very upset when they found out they missed 
their flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six men, whom he would not name, had attended the  
game and then went to an early morning reception before returning 
to their hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a U.S. law enforcement official, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said at least one Cuban was being processed for 
possible asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 Cubans were part of the delegation that attended  
Monday night's game, which the Cubans won 12-6. Besides players, 
the delegation included journalists, retired baseball players, 
ordinary citizens, members of youth groups and outstanding 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service would not comment on  
possible defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asylum is a very confidential process and I cannot confirm or  
deny that we are processing any members of the Cuban group,'' said 
Ben Ferro, regional director for the INS in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore police initially said they were not involved. But  
spokesman Rob Weinhold said later that six members of the 
delegation overslept in their hotel rooms because they thought the 
plane was leaving later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	During a long speech welcoming the players at Havana University,  
Cuban President Fidel Castro mentioned and criticized defections in 
general, but there was no indication that anyone had stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, a rematch after the Orioles defeated the Cuban players  
in Havana 3-2 on March 28, was surrounded by controversy. Hundreds 
of protesters gathered outside Camden Yards to speak out against 
Castro, while a smaller group supporting the lifting of sanctions 
against Cuba protested nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men from Miami who ran onto the field in the fourth inning  
were given citations for misdemeanor trespassing. A 13-year-old boy 
also was detained but not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, one of three Cubans umpiring, Cesar Valdez, struck  
and body-slammed a demonstrator who had run onto the field carrying 
a sign that said ``Freedom -- Strike Out Against Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, I am Cuban,'' Valdez explained. ``I just thought it  
was the right way to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Seek Clinton Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers want President Clinton to  
pay at least $300,000 as a penalty for contempt of court, a figure 
his attorney calls ``outrageous and greedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said that attorneys  
who assisted the former Arkansas state employee were not adequately 
paid for their work when they received portions of a settlement 
Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being greedy, everyone took far less than what they  
put in,'' said Whitehead. A final figure, which Jones' lawyers will 
finalize on Thursday, could exceed $300,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers have until Friday to submit a reimbursement figure  
to a court in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	They recently approached Clinton's attorneys to inquire if the  
president would agree to pay the $300,000 to settle a judge's 
historic contempt ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry comes less than a month after U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright concluded that Clinton intentionally gave false 
testimony during Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. The judge 
ordered him to repay her lawyers any ``reasonable expenses'' they 
incurred as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers made the approach to Clinton's attorneys in  
the past week, first in a phone call and then in a letter. They had 
hoped to present to the judge a sum to which both sides had agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Wright probably will have to decide if Mrs. Jones'  
reimbursement request is reasonable and amounts to an adequate 
penalty for the first president ever to be found in contempt of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer signaled that the president would contest any  
amount that approached $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what they suggested and it is outrageous and greedy  
and, I think, a gross misunderstanding of the court's order,'' 
attorney Robert Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money Clinton is ordered to reimburse Mrs. Jones for legal  
bills is above and beyond the $850,000 he paid her earlier this 
year to settle her charges that he made an unwanted sexual advance 
at a Little Rock hotel in 1991. At the time, Clinton was Arkansas 
governor and Mrs. Jones was a state worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies any wrongdoing and said he settled the sexual  
harassment case, which prompted the disclosure of his affair with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent 
impeachment proceedings, simply to bring an end to a public crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Wright issued her contempt ruling, Mrs. Jones'  
lawyers estimated they would seek reimbursement for ``tens of 
thousands'' of dollars in legal expenses, which included efforts to 
try to disprove Clinton's sworn denial of an affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there's a possibility that a lawsuit that Americans have  
long since tired of will be stretched out by more legal 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ruled April 12 that Clinton gave ``false, misleading and  
evasive answers'' in a January 1998 deposition in which he denied 
having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of the 
false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to reimburse the 
court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside over the 
taking of the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	And she referred the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court's  
Professional Conduct Committee, which has the power to revoke 
Clinton's law license or to impose other sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Leaves Areas in Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The sun was shining and the wind was  
picking up Tuesday over Lake Shore Trailer Park, where a small, 
manmade lake was brimming with the remnants of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	A mobile home floated upside down in the nameless lake. Wreckage  
drifted past. Clothing hung on trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Rohlman picked up clothing near his trailer, which had  
been squashed by the roof of his neighbor's trailer home. He had 
gone to a bookstore a few minutes before the tornado hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gone there I might not be around,'' he said.  
``Boy, a lot of that stuff is buried. What a mess. I'm going to 
have to dig it out piece by piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado did serious damage in Kansas, killing five people  
and injuring 100 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Spawned by the same storm system Monday that produced even  
deadlier tornadoes across the state line in Oklahoma, the Kansas 
tornado cut a path 12 miles long and 3 miles wide in southern 
Wichita and suburban Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' Eric Peterson, a recent transplant from  
Seattle, said of the ruin that included a tree thrown into his 
bedroom in Haysville, just south of Wichita. ``I have been in 
typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, but this tops 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard troops joined about 200 state and local police in  
the area and dogs were used to search the wreckage for possible 
additional victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and his wife, Julie, grabbed their 5-year-old son  
before the twister struck and ran to a shelter. Their one-story, 
rented home was still standing, despite a damaged roof. Their boy's 
wooden swing set had been picked up and hurled into a yard four 
houses away. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 150 houses, 27 businesses and three churches were  
damaged or destroyed in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the lake, Misty and David Seeber walked along a shore  
with trees stripped bare, picking through the pile of broken wood 
and twisted metal that used to be their home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her 22nd birthday on Tuesday. The couple found some  
wedding pictures and her wedding dress and were looking for David's 
wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find his wedding ring, we'll be happy,'' she said.  
``We're very lucky somebody's watching over us.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seeking Senate Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are still searching for a few good  
candidates for the Senate for 2000, and not above looking to the 
occasional Republican or independent as part of their assault 
against a 55-45 GOP majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials are talking of the possibility that Minnesota's  
state auditor, Judy Dutcher, a Republican, might switch parties and 
challenge GOP Sen. Rod Grams. Dutcher has been elected twice to her 
statewide post, and Grams is viewed as the most vulnerable 
Republican on next year's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., chairman of the Democratic campaign  
committee, said he would be interested in ``progressive people 
despite their previous affiliation'' taking a look at challenging 
Grams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutcher, in a telephone interview, said a ``number of  
(Democratic) senators have contacted me and given me 
encouragement'' about a possible challenge to Grams. She's also 
talked with officials from Emily's List, a Washington-based 
organization with strong Democratic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	She described herself as ``pro-choice, pro-gay rights,  
pro-public education'' and a fiscal conservative, and someone who 
has won union backing in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not made a decision one way or another,'' and won't for  
a while, Dutcher said, adding that she is also being courted to run 
as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among more conventional Democratic contenders, Rep. David Minge  
has announced creation of an exploratory committee and has begun 
raising money for a possible race against Grams. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	The independent who's attracted attention from Democratic  
recruiters is Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, being urged to run 
against veteran Republican Sen. James Jeffords. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have offered to protect Sanders' seniority rights and  
committee assignments in the Senate, as they have done in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sanders is in line for a House subcommittee chairmanship  
should Democrats regain control, and seems tugged by the prospect 
of other liberal-minded lawmakers gaining House chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
	He has told Senate Democratic recruiters he'll make up his mind  
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are looking for candidates elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, where Sen. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term, three  
Democratic lawmakers have taken themselves out of the running -- 
Reps. Ted Strickland; Sherrod Brown and Marcy Kaptur. Among the 
names that have surfaced is Joel Hyatt, son-in-in-law of former 
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum. Hyatt lost to DeWine in 1994. Former Rep. 
Dennis Eckart, now with a law firm with offices in Ohio and 
Washington, is also exploring a candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have a different problem in New Jersey, where former  
Democratic Gov. James Florio is running for a seat being vacated by 
retiring Democrat Sen. Frank Lautenberg. When last on the ballot, 
Florio lost his bid for a second term as governor in a voters' 
revolt over higher taxes. Democratic officials are notably 
unenthusiastic about his running for the Senate. Rep. Frank Pallone 
is considering a primary challenge, and party officials have 
courted Jon Corzine, a wealthy businessman. Republican Gov. 
Christie Whitman, who ousted Florio from the statehouse, is 
expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	In California, it's the Republicans who are scratching for a  
well-established candidate. Rep. James Rogan, who played a role in 
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, announced 
recently he wouldn't challenge Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
Bill Horn, a wealthy San Diego County supervisor, has filed papers 
for an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must defend 19 of the 34 seats on the ballot next  
year. Democratic hopes for a takeover faded early this year when 
Lautenberg, New York's Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Nevada Sen. 
Richard Bryan decided to retire. In addition, House Democratic 
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri has been urging House members to 
stay where they are, on the theory that the party has a strong 
chance to take control of the House, and little if any prospects in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is expected to meet  
Wednesday with about two dozen rank-and-file Republicans eager for 
a floor debate on legislation to overhaul campaign finance laws. 
The Republicans, led by Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., have thus far 
withheld support from a Democratic-led petition drive to force the 
measure to the floor. But they're expected to tell Hastert they 
want him to let the bill get to the floor, or risk their defection 
on the Democratic initiative.

<HEADLINE> Video Explores Auto Racing Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- A fan's videotape shows a wheel flying into  
the stands where three people were killed in last week's Pep Boys 
Indy Racing League event, but the footage isn't as revealing as 
investigators had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't show it from start to finish, but it's still better  
than anything we've gotten up to this point,'' Lowe's Motor 
Speedway spokesman Jerry Gappens said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gappens said the camcorder videotape was shot by a spectator  
sitting in the terrace boxes atop the fourth-turn grandstands when 
a three-car wreck sent a wheel and suspension debris into the 
seats. In addition to the fatalities, eight spectators were injured 
in Saturday night's accident, including a 9-year-old girl who 
remained in critical condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are hoping someone has videotape showing how the  
wheel snapped off one of the cars in the wreck. They also want to 
determine how much clearance there was between the wheel and the 
top of a safety fence that reaches 15 feet above the track surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The information would help them determine if any safety changes  
could be made to the cars and how much the height of the fence 
should be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The spectator's videotape that was turned over to speedway  
officials Monday night shows neither the wreck itself nor the wheel 
going over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see it after it clears the fence and before it hit. It was  
already on its way down and it was coming in high,'' Gappens said. 
``But at least we see the object coming into the stands. It's the 
first time we've seen that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was carried by Speedvision, a cable network that was  
broadcasting an IRL race for the first time. Speedvision's cameras 
did not capture the start of the wreck or any debris flying into 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television video usually helps quite a bit,'' Gappens said,  
``but that's not the case this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without conclusive evidence of how much clearance there was  
between the wheel and the top of the catch fence, speedway 
officials are still considering raising the height. The track's 
engineers and architects have been studying the matter since the 
accident, and a decision is likely soon, Gappens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully in the next day or two we'll have something more to  
share in that regard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, a funeral was held for the first of the victims. A  
service for Jeffrey Patton, 32, was conducted in his hometown of 
Hickory. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled today for Randy Pyatte, 21, of Connelly  
Springs. The parents of the third victim, Barry Mobley, 41, of 
Statesville, planned to take his body back to their home in Georgia 
for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, remains in Carolinas Medical Center in 
Charlotte with brain and lung injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials held the first of several counseling sessions  
for any of the nearly 50,000 spectators who want to discuss the 
accident. Three 90-minute sessions were offered Tuesday in 
Charlotte and two more were scheduled for tonight and Thursday 
nights in Hildebran.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Awards Honor to Rosa Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton authorized giving civil  
rights heroine Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed a bill Tuesday bestowing Congress' highest  
recognition on the 86-year-old Parks, whose refusal more than four 
decades ago to give up her seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., 
inspired civil rights advocates across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her act that December day was, in itself, a simple one; but it  
required uncommon courage,'' the president said in a statement. 
``It was a ringing rebuke to those who denied the dignity and 
restricted the rights of African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest in December 1955 of Parks set off a lengthy bus  
boycott led by Martin Luther King Jr. and provoked a Supreme Court 
challenge to Montgomery's segregation law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rosa Parks' short bus trip, and all the distances she has  
traveled in the years since, have brought the American people ever 
closer to the promised land that we know it can truly be,'' Clinton 
said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Spot Possible Moon Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It might not sound like the most promising  
real estate: Temperature -64 degrees, rocky, no atmosphere. But 
researchers say nearly constant sunlight makes the Moon's south 
pole an ideal spot for a future base. 
</P>
<P>
	Three sites near the Moon's south pole provide nearly constant  
light, researchers report in the May 1 edition of Geophysical 
Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the bases could use solar energy, reducing or  
eliminating the need for other energy sources, according to the 
team lead by D. Ben J. Bussey of the European Space Agency in 
Noordwijk, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	And, besides the energy potential of the sunny sites, there are  
nearby locations in constant darkness, the researchers added. There 
is the possibility that water ice could be hidden in such 
locations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the location of any Moon base would depend to a great  
extent on the purpose of the base, the researchers focused on three 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Site A is on the rim of Shackleton crater and B is about six  
miles away on a ridge originating from that rim. Site C is on the 
rim of another nearby crater. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Moon's 708-hour day, A is in sunlight 80 percent of  
the time, B is lighted 70 percent and C about 65 percent of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only a period of 10 hours when neither A nor B are in  
sunlight,'' the researchers added. ``Therefore if solar arrays were 
placed in both areas and connected by a link (either microwave or 
cable) then a base at either site would receive near constant solar 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature at the suggested sites is relatively constant  
because of the steady light and was estimated at about -64 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Engineers say it is easier to deal with a constant 
extreme temperature than one that is changing, as would happen 
elsewhere on the moon with the regular shifts from daylight to 
darkness.

<HEADLINE> New Serb Terror Campaign Is Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- Terrified Kosovo refugees, some with  
gunshot wounds or bruises, on Tuesday accused masked Serb fighters 
of gunning down people who refused to hand over their money in the 
latest campaign to expel ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings took place Sunday night northwest of Pristina, the  
Kosovo capital, according to accounts from refugees who crossed 
Tuesday into northern Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Some put the death toll at about 100 or higher, while others  
said they saw dozens of bodies on the roadside, in cars and in a 
stream. It was impossible to independently verify the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Izet Krasniqi, his left shoulder heavily bandaged due to a  
bullet wound, said he saw 20 to 30 people shot to death in Studime, 
about 18 miles from Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police shot me,'' he said from the front seat of a relief  
agency vehicle taking him for medical treatment. He described the 
encounter tersely -- masked Serb fighters demanded his money, and 
when he said he had none, the Serbs opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they shot me, I ran,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a wagon hauled by a tractor, Zylfie Gerxhali and her  
12-year-old daughter wept as they told how four men -- including 
Zylfie's husband -- were killed before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Zylfie Gerxhali said the masked Serb fighters stopped the wagon  
Sunday night in Studime and demanded money from her husband, Avdyl. 
When he said he had none, the Serbs took him and three others, 
including his brother, and shot them to death on the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard him shout when they shot him,'' she said. When the  
soldiers returned to the wagon, she gave them money and a necklace 
because ``they said they would kill everyone if I didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in a different wagon, Selvie Goguri, said she saw bodies  
lying on the roadside, in cars and in a river in Studime. She and 
others said at least 100 people died along a half-mile stretch of 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovapress, the Kosovo Liberation Army's news agency, said  
about 100 civilians were killed by Serb soldiers in the offensive. 
The bodies were reportedly hauled away by soldiers driving tractors 
and dumped in a mass grave, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 refugees crossed into northern Albania by early  
evening, most of them crammed on wagons hauled by tractor, or on 
foot. They came from various regions of Kosovo, and many said they 
had been on the move for weeks, staying in the mountains or in 
different villages until forced to move on by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people said Serb forces also separated men from other  
refugees in Vranica, in southern Kosovo, and in the Djakovica area, 
in the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other recent arrivals from the nearby city of Prizren,  
the refugees crossing Tuesday looked exhausted from their travels. 
At least two men had gunshot wounds and several had bruised or cut 
faces from what they said were beatings by Serb police. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the U.N. refugee agency and local officials worked  
to persuade Kosovo refugees to leave the border region of northern 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said officials were becoming increasingly frustrated with 
the estimated 30,000 Kosovo Albanians refusing to leave several 
camps in and around Kukes, the regional center nearest to the 
Morini border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many refugees worry they will be sent off to new, unknown camps  
without finding out about relatives still in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Kukes authorities could eventually force people out,  
perhaps by declaring the area a security zone and implementing a 
kind of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
	On at least one previous occasion, police forced a few thousand  
refugees to leave one Kukes camp at dawn -- a move the UNHCR 
protested as excessive for people already driven out of their homes 
by Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Internet Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The nation's major Internet companies  
have agreed to offer parents faster access to technology allowing 
them to control and monitor children's on-line habits, Vice 
President Al Gore said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called the agreement ``a positive step forward'' that could  
keep youngsters away from ``inappropriate content'' like violent 
game sites or hate group sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord comes in the wake of the deadly school shooting spree  
in Colorado, which has raised questions about youngsters being 
exposed to violent and hate-filled sites on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving parents and teachers this ability will help ensure that  
our children can get the most from the vast educational potential 
of the Internet while keeping them safe,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, officials have developed an Internet site  
containing a series of resources, including a ``guide to good 
content,'' and safety tips for youngsters and parents interested in 
surfing the Internet. The Internet companies agreed to provide a 
link to the new site from their home pages or a popular spot on 
their sites, meaning ``parents and kids will be just one click away 
from a comprehensive resource guide,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also include a guide to the latest technologies to allow  
parents to take charge of the home computer, including ways to 
block children's access to such places as hate group sites or 
violent video games. Other technologies allow parents to monitor 
the Internet sites visited by children and limit the time 
youngsters spend on line.	   Gore aides said the agreement will cover ``sites that account 
for 95 percent of all Internet traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the bargaining that led to the agreement, to  
be announced on Wednesday in Washington, said the plan also 
includes a campaign to market the new guide. It will be financed 
largely by Internet companies, a Gore aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of sites on the Internet are designed to offer guides  
for parents, including some created by the federal government. 
Backers of the proposal say it will get more attention than other 
sites and be more widely used because it will be promoted by major 
Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of violence and hate sites on the Internet has been  
hotly discussed since the deadly school shootings in Littleton, 
Colo., and reports that the killers there often played violent 
video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have pushed for restrictions on content allowed on the  
Internet, but they face critics who raise free speech issues that 
generally have been backed by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Davidson, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and  
Technology, said the plan is a workable balance between the needs 
to protect speech and children at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a group that cares about civil liberties and cares about  
kids, this is the right answer,'' said Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	At another stop Tuesday, Milano Bakery in Detroit, Gore  
applauded Dragoslav Janevski, the owner, for building his business 
in downtown Detroit's empowerment zone rather than in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Detroit for its use of federal empowerment zone  
dollars, saying the city had received $4 billion in new 
investments. The zone in Detroit targets investment and offers tax 
breaks for businesses locating in an 18.2-square-mile section of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president and 2000 presidential hopeful called on  
Congress to fund a second round of empowerment zones. They have the 
potential to create 90,000 jobs and stimulate more than $20 billion 
in public and private investments, he said.

<HEADLINE> La. Police Say Man Shot Accuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONCHATOULA, La. (AP) -- A man who was about to go on trial on  
sexual assault charges Tuesday shot his accuser and killed her aunt 
as the women left for court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that Aubrey LeBlanc Jr., 41, opened fire  
outside his accuser's home, killing her aunt, Donna Crenshaw, 37. 
The alleged victim of LeBlanc's sexual assault, who is 18, was in 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police hunted for LeBlanc. His car was found at his home in  
nearby Metairie. 
</P>
<P>
	LeBlanc was arrested in June on charges of sexually assaulting  
the young woman, then 16, while he lived with her and her mother. 
The accuser was scheduled to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was allowed to remain free on bail during his trial. Jury  
selection was completed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ponchatoula is 40 miles northwest of New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> `Noah's Ark' Leads NBC To Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's an old story, but that didn't drive viewers  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night of the biblical mini-series ``Noah's Ark'' on  
Sunday had higher ratings than any other TV movie this year, 
leading NBC to an easy victory during the first week of the 
important May ratings ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie performed better than anything NBC has televised since  
George Clooney's exit from ``ER'' in February. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than a month to go in the season, CBS leads NBC for  
the year's household ratings crown by one-tenth of a percentage 
point. NBC has a slightly wider lead over Fox in the ratings among 
adults aged 18-49, which advertisers covet. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.5 rating and 16 share, easily  
eclipsing CBS's 8.1 rating and 14 share. ABC had a 7.1 rating and 
12 share, while Fox was at 6.3 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.0 rating and 5 share  
and UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share. Nielsen said its ratings for 
Pax TV would not be ready until later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``100 Years of Great Women'' special performed well for  
the network, finishing 23rd for the week. CBS's reunion movie, 
``The Patty Duke Show'' finished a lackluster 49th place. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN had some rare good news with the performance of its ``WWF  
Smackdown'' special, the highest rated show on the network last 
week. UPN executives are already talking about making wrestling a 
regular part of the network special next year. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's two-part ``Mr. Murder'' movie had a dismal showing. Its  
second part last Tuesday finished tied for 82nd for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news race with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was second at 7.6 
and 17, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 26-May 2, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Noah's Ark, Part One,'' 
NBC, 20.9; ``ER,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.1; ``Friends,'' 
NBC, 13.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 
12.5; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 12.3; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 11.1; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
11.0.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Shares Jump 43 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly minted shares of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.  
soared 33 percent in their first day of trading Tuesday as 
investors welcomed Wall Street's elite investment bank into the 
public arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's shares, which trade under the symbol GS, rose to  
$70.37 1/2, a gain of $17.37 1/2 from the $53 price set in Monday's 
initial public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump gave Goldman a market value of $38.6 billion, instantly  
making the company worth more than Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 22 million shares changed hands, making Goldman the  
second-most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Goldman ended its 130-year run as a private  
partnership, selling 69 million shares in an IPO that raised $3.66 
billion. It was the second-largest IPO in U.S. history after last 
year's $4 billion stock sale by Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the company went public to gain ``the flexibility to 
use publicly traded securities to finance strategic acquisitions 
that we may elect to make in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Akron Paper Was Silent About Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Akron Beacon Journal reported Tuesday  
that its publisher and a reporter knew of an allegation of 
wife-beating against the city's police chief, but the newspaper 
published nothing about it for almost two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher John L. Dotson Jr. said Chief Edward Irvine phoned him  
Oct. 15 to say that his wife, Geneva, ``had been drinking, fell on 
the steps carrying a vacuum cleaner and that she was in the 
hospital.'' He quoted Irvine as saying his wife said he had pushed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotson said he told Irvine he was ``not the conduit to the  
newsroom'' but that he would watch out for the story and, if one 
were in preparation, make certain Irvine got the opportunity to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	When the incident did not appear on the newspaper's budget of  
planned stories for several days, Dotson said, ``I figured there 
wasn't a story and stopped checking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 16, Irvine summoned members of his department's Internal  
Affairs Unit, which investigates misconduct by police officers, to 
his office and ordered them to investigate his wife's complaint, 
the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At about the same time, the newspaper reported, the chief also  
talked to Beacon Journal police reporter Robert Hoiles, telling 
him, ``I want to tell you something in confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles recognized that he was torn between obligations to his  
employer and his promise to a news source but decided to remain 
silent and not betray a confidence, the Beacon Journal said. He has 
refused to say anything other than he was informed of the statement 
Mrs. Irvine made at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles has since been moved from the police beat and given  
another reporting assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, police investigators interviewed Mrs. Irvine,  
who denied that her husband had harmed her. She told officers the 
reason she had said originally that he had attacked her was that 
she was embarrassed that she lost track of her dosages of her 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't hit me,'' officers quoted her as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation quickly wound down, with police interviewing  
no neighbors, friends or relatives, the newspaper reported. The 
final police report concluded there was no substantiation of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on Dec. 10 someone phoned another Beacon Journal  
reporter, Bob Dyer, urging him to go the police department and ask 
to see incident report No. 98034694, which police later said had 
been inadvertently misfiled and was not discovered and filed 
properly until Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	After obtaining the report, Dyer wrote a story about the  
investigation, which the paper published Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's followup story about the investigation was accompanied  
by a column by Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, in hindsight, I was misled and may not have been as  
alert as I should have been to a significant possible news story 
involving a major department of our city government,'' the 
publisher wrote. ``I may have erred. If so, I can assure you, our 
readers, that I won't make the same mistake again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine denies asking either Dotson or Hoiles to withhold  
coverage of the incident, the Beacon Journal reported.

<HEADLINE> $5.4M Radiation Case Settlement Ok'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday approved a $5.4  
million settlement of lawsuits by families of cancer patients who 
were the subjects of Cold War radiation experiments by University 
of Cincinnati researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case puts researchers on notice that people who are  
experimented on must be told what is being done to them and why, 
said Robert Newman, a lawyer for about 50 plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government can't trick people into being part of a drug trial  
or a psychological experiment or radiation experiment,'' Newman 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the plaintiffs has died. The defendants never  
conceded that the experiments contributed to the deaths of the 
patients, who already had advanced cases of cancer when they 
underwent experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit charged that the approximately 90 cancer patients  
who received radiation treatments from 1960 to 1972 in Cincinnati 
were not fully informed of the risks, or told that the Defense 
Department was getting the results to learn what might happen to 
troops exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Eugene L. Saenger, one of the chief researchers, has said  
his main objective was to study experimental treatments for 
patients with inoperable cancer to see if he could stop the growth 
of tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The university administration believes the research was  
appropriate and there was no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement approved Tuesday gives each of the families about  
$50,000, plus the right to have the patient from their family 
listed on a plaque in a courtyard at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Foster, a Cincinnati woman whose grandmother Parthenia  
Marshall, 82, died in 1982 after receiving the radiation 
bombardments, said Tuesday she is pleased with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad it's over,'' Ms. Foster said.

</P>
<P>
	RONAN, Mont. (AP) -- Art Aylesworth, ``the bluebird man'' of  
Montana, whose devotion to the colorful mountain bluebird led to 
the placing of more than 35,000 nest boxes in Montana, died 
Saturday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Aylesworth was an early participant in state conservation  
organizations, pioneering efforts in goose nesting sites throughout 
the Mission Valley and other habitat restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
	He became widely known among conservationists as ``the bluebird  
man'' because of his quarter-century of passion for the spectacular 
mountain bird. 
</P>
<P>
	It began with a few nest boxes he built from scrap lumber at his  
ranch in 1974. He began giving away his boxes to anyone willing to 
put them out and to monitor their success in fledging baby 
bluebirds, a species whose natural habitat in the cavities of old 
trees had been dramatically reduced by logging. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mountain Bluebird Trails group that he founded 20 years ago,  
and headed until his death, estimated he and his volunteers had 
built and given away more than 35,000 bluebird nest boxes.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired police Lt. Daniel N. Cooke, a Police  
Department spokesman for 22 years and technical adviser to movies 
and television programs such as ``Dragnet'' and ``Adam 12,'' died 
April 30 of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke was the department's most prominent spokesman for many  
years before his retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	As the department's technical adviser to the entertainment  
industry he reviewed television and movie scripts. He became a 
friend of ``Dragnet'' star and producer Jack Webb, who created the 
``just the facts, ma'am'' image of Los Angeles police detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	In syndicated reruns, ``Dragnet'' was called ``Badge 714'' --  
Cooke's badge number. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1953, walking  
a downtown beat before becoming press relations officer in 1964.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Edward Davis, a one-time mechanic who became the  
first black American to own a new car dealership, died Monday of 
congestive heart failure. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis worked at a Dodge plant before selling cars at a  
ChryslerPlymouth dealership. Although he wasn't allowed to sell on 
the showroom floor with the white salespeople, he successfully 
promoted himself in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, he opened Davis Motors Sales, a used car lot in  
downtown Detroit. In 1940, it became a Studebaker dealership. He 
kept the franchise until the manufacturer closed in 1956. In 
November 1963, he was awarded a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis retired in 1971 and became the manager for Detroit's  
Department of Street Railway Systems. He continued to work as a 
consultant to minority auto dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the National Association of Minority Automobile Dealers  
created the annual Edward Davis Pioneer Award. A scholarship fund 
has been established in his honor to help blacks pursue careers in 
the automobile industry. In January, Davis became the first black 
man to be inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame Museum in 
Dearborn.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ernest Gross, a former State Department legal  
adviser and delegate to the United Nations, died Sunday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross, an international lawyer, was legal counsel to U.N.  
Assistant Secretary General Ralph Bunche and to U.N. Secretary 
General Dag Hammarskjold. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Gross helped introduce a convention against genocide to  
the United Nations. In the 1960s, while in private practice, he

</P>
<P>
	He had Alzheimer's disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Hendrix played left defensive end for LSU. He was a senior in  
1958, when the Tigers went 10-0 to win the national championship, 
then defeated Clemson 7-0 in the Sugar Bowl.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. chief financial officer  
Harry L. Kavetas, who helped engineer nearly 20,000 job cuts at the 
photography company to counter Japanese gains in the U.S. market, 
died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime executive at IBM, Kavetas was hired as Kodak's chief  
financial officer in 1994. He took over with much of a new strategy 
in place, to slash overhead and lay off 10,000 workers. It was 
aimed at defending Kodak's mainstay photographic businesses from 
assault by Japanese nemesis Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, Kavetas and his boss, CEO George Fisher, resorted  
to even deeper cutbacks when Fuji slashed film prices in the United 
States and grabbed market share on Kodak's dominant home turf. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, Kodak expects to trim more than $1  
billion in costs by eliminating almost one-fifth of its worldwide 
payroll of 100,500. The company has seen a sharp rebound in sales 
and profits in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kodak, Kavetas was appointed executive vice president in  
September 1994 and elected to the board of directors in May 1997.

	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Meredith Morgan, who helped guide the  
University of California, Berkeley, optometry school through 67 of 
its 75 years, died Saturday of lung cancer. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his research into basic mechanisms of eye focus and  
alignment, Morgan was a professor for 33 years and dean of the 
School of Optometry from 1960 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	His research into the elements of binocular vision resulted in  
two dozen papers laying out a basic understanding of how the two 
eyes work together to focus and converge on objects at close range. 
He also contributed to textbooks on the vision of children and the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan continued to be active with the university after his  
tenure and wrote the lead chapter in the recent book, ``Cal 
Optometry -- The First 75 Years.''

<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Robert R. Scherer, the vice president and  
market manager for Clear Channel Broadcasting, died Tuesday of 
cancer. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Scherer was hired by WHAS Inc. in 1963. He was an account  
executive, sales manager and general manager for WHAS/WAMZ until 
September 1996, when WHAS Inc. was sold to Clear Channel 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clear Channel, Scherer was named vice president and added  
market manager to his responsibilities in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also a past president and director of the Kentucky  
Broadcasters Association and a chairman and executive committee 
member of the Kentucky Derby Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Scherer received the Al Temple Award for outstanding  
contributions to the Kentucky Broadcasters Association and the 
National Association of Broadcasters. The following year, he was 
honored by the Society of Professional Journalists for a lifetime 
of distinguished service.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- J. John Sepkoski Jr., a University of Chicago  
paleontologist known for his research of fossil records and the 
history of marine animal life, died Saturday of heart failure 
related to high blood pressure. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sepkoski's major accomplishments was analyzing data  
dating as far back as 600 million years and using it to study the 
history of oceanic life, said Douglas Erwin, a research 
paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution and editor of the 
journal Paleobiology. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Sepkoski and a colleague developed a theory that  
catastrophic extinctions of marine animals may have occurred about 
every 26 million years during the past 250 million years. These 
periodic events included the extinction of dinosaurs -- events that 
had been previously considered random occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial theory helped shape the view that mass  
extinctions of land and marine animals may have been caused by an 
external force, such as the impact of a comet or asteroid.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management To Pay Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Waste Management Inc. has agreed to pay $756,680  
and extend job offers to 15 job applicants who alleged race and sex 
discrimination in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	An arm of the U.S. Labor Department brought the allegations  
after finding in routine reviews that the garbage hauler had denied 
female and minority applicants equal opportunity for hiring. The 
agency said their qualifications were equal to or greater than the 
white men who were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the company denied truck-driving jobs to five  
women and 10 black or Hispanic men in Cicero and Morris, Ill., and 
in Portage, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were unfortunate and regrettable occurrences involving  
just a few of our operations,'' said company spokesman Bill 
Plunkett. ``Waste Management recognizes its obligations as a 
federal contractor to comply with both the letter and the spirit of 
the law, and we try to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plunkett said Waste Management chose to resolve the issue  
through the settlement but did not admit any violation in doing so. 
``We have taken steps to reinforce our policies in this area,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Waste Services last year unveiled a plan to buy  
Waste Management and move its Oak Brook headquarters to Houston but 
retain the Waste Management name. The deal has since been 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Online Broker Accountability Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's top securities regulator,  
noting that ads for online trading often resemble lottery 
commercials, is urging Internet brokerages to better warn their 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Explaining clearly to customers ... would go a long way toward  
reducing the complaints pouring into the SEC, Congress and firms,'' 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To every online firm, I challenge you to meaningfully  
communicate with your customers,'' Levitt said in a speech at the 
National Press Club. ``Talk in realistic terms; let them know their 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an SEC review of online brokerage account agreements  
found that ``almost none'' of them discuss trading risks or what 
customers should do if there is a computer system outage. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC chief also said online firms need to ensure they have  
adequate computer system capacity to handle the swarms of new 
customers, asserting that the brokers have a legal obligation to 
provide efficient execution of trading orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he's not convinced the market watchdog agency needs  
a new set of regulations for online investing, but he did not rule 
out that possibility in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized advertisements by some Internet brokers which  
he said more closely resemble commercials for the playing the 
lottery by promising quick riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's bull market there may be an increasing population  
of tow-truck drivers who now own their own islands as a result of 
online investing. ... (But) I'm worried these commercials step over 
the line and border on irresponsibility,'' he said, referring to 
one widely aired ad campaign on television, Levitt said, 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's remarks come as the SEC and the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, a self-policing brokers' group, have been 
investigating online brokerages nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to looking for violations of securities laws, the  
investigators are examining how well firms execute orders and warn 
customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said SEC auditors already have inspected online firms  
representing 80 percent of the electronic-trading market. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say that by year's end, 10 million amateur investors  
will be trading at least occasionally over the Internet, and online 
customers will account for about a quarter of all retail stock 
trades. The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab, 
E-Trade Group, Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect and Discover 
Brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also expressed concern about that rising popularity of  
day trading, a practice in which investors scope out fast-moving 
stocks, buying and selling them quickly to profit from the sudden 
price swings. Many day-trading companies sell training courses and 
special software to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing day-trading opportunities is not itself against the  
law, but these firms should be on notice that they ... must operate 
within the existing rules,'' Levitt said. He added that firms 
should ensure that their day-trading strategies are suitable for 
customers' financial circumstances and trading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galvin, Massachusetts' secretary of state, announced  
Monday a settlement with All-Tech Investment Group in which the big 
day-trading firm agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse 
customers $228,000. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the  
settlement, but agreed not to sign up any new customers in the 
state for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of day-trading firms acknowledge that the strategy is  
not right for everyone, but contend state regulators are unfairly 
tarnishing the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have 
misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Sales Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers can't seem to get enough new cars and  
trucks, pushing the auto industry's sales boom into its second 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major automakers that reported April sales results  
Monday, total sales were up 7.5 percent. Ford Motor Co., 
DaimlerChrysler AG and Japan's three biggest automakers each 
reported gains over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly year-to-year sales comparisons have been up through the  
past 13 months except in July and August, when total sales were 
artificially depressed as two strikes against General Motors Corp. 
restricted its supply. 
</P>
<P>
	GM remained the only major automaker to report its sales today.  
Analysts expected it to report flat to slightly lower sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring any surprises from GM ... it looks like another  
gangbuster month,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for April's improvement were familiar: a robust  
economy and consumers confident enough about the future to take on 
the increased debt of a new car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has the legs of a marathon runner,'' said Yale  
Gieszl, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``Consumers 
look at interest rates, inflation, Wall Street and the job market 
and have every reason to be confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its April sales were up 7 percent last month, compared  
with April 1998. Sales of light trucks set an April record -- the 
company's 12th straight monthly record for pickups, vans, minivans 
and sport utility vehicles combined. Car sales were up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include Ford's Volvo AB or Jaguar Cars units,  
each of which reported its U.S. sales rose 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said demand is so strong that it is again increasing its  
second-quarter production schedule, this time by 20,000 additional 
vehicles. With last month's 30,000 increase, Ford now plans to 
build just over 1.26 million cars and trucks during the April-June 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat unusual month at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler  
unit, in that its biggest improvement came in car sales. Total 
sales improved 2 percent; cars were up 6 percent while truck sales 
were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler unit sells more than twice as many light trucks as  
cars. But its minivan sales fell 19 percent just as the spring 
buying season was heating up, and pickup sales were flat. Healy 
said April's minivan performance was the ``hangover'' of 
incentive-driven sales in March that depleted inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said truck  
sales also suffered from a tough comparison to April 1998 when 
sales were boosted by a coupon war launched by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker posted an 18 percent gain in sales  
of highly profitable SUVs. In fact, SUV sales at the former 
Chrysler Corp. have set monthly records in 17 of the last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. posted its best April ever in the United  
States, with sales up nearly 10 percent. Its 7 percent rise in car 
sales was led once again by the Camry, the nation's bestseller, 
with sales up 21 percent for its best April ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Japanese automaker also was boosted by a 13.5  
percent rise in truck sales: the hot-selling Lexus RX300 SUV was up 
78 percent, while; the Sienna minivan had its best month ever with 
a 25 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. also benefited from improved truck sales, up 53  
percent. Overall sales improved 4 percent, dragged down by a 3 
percent decline in car sales. Honda's new Odyssey minivan posted a 
211 percent gain, while sales of the CR-V compact SUV improved 41 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Honda's top-seller, the Accord sedan, were flat while  
sales of the Civic subcompact were off 7 percent. But buyers 
flocked to the Acura TL luxury sedan, whose sales nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. had its biggest improvement in months: total  
sales were up 21 percent, led by a 26 percent gain in trucks. Its 
redesigned Quest minivan, for example, nearly doubled sales over 
April 1998. Car sales were up nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG said it has its best April in the United States in  
19 years, with sales up 29.5 percent on the strength of a new 
product lineup. Its redesigned Jetta sedan led the sales drive, 
with its best single month since the original version was 
introduced in 1980.

<HEADLINE>  PGA Appeals Cart Ruling in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- PGA Tour lawyers tried to overturn Casey  
Martin's golf cart ruling Tuesday, saying the decision allowing the 
disabled pro to ride is as fundamental a change to the game as 
taking the dribble out of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walking rule is a substantial rule, expressly designed to  
inject stress and fatigue, and impact the outcome of the game,'' 
PGA Tour attorney Andrew Hurwitz told a three-judge panel of the 
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ``In an elite athletic 
competition, certain rules must apply equally to everyone,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurwitz added that walking in golfing ``determines how players  
must go from shot to shot, just as the dribbling rule determines 
how basketball players must go down the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that  
makes it painful for him to walk long distances, won the right last 
year to ride on tour under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
which bars discrimination against the disabled in the workplace, 
public accommodations and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's attorney contended that the PGA, whether it likes it or  
not, is subject to the ADA and he scoffed at the suggestion that 
walking is a necessary part of playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Casey Martin doesn't want to be judged by a lesser skill level  
than anyone else in competition, but just don't come up with this 
walking rule, which was born out of tradition,'' attorney Roy 
Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reardon maintained that riding over the course gives Martin no  
advantage over his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stress is what causes golfers to wear down, not walking up and  
down hills,'' he told the panel. ``They're not doing that at any 
speed. Stress is the mental stress, the same kind of mental stress 
Casey Martin suffers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin limped into court early sporting a suntan and a navy  
blazer and sat quietly, flanked by his brother and his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based appeals court was not expected to rule  
for months. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA's appeal is based on the argument that the cart  
threatens the essence of the centuries-old sport by giving an 
unfair advantage to one golfer, reasoning which Martin rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it easier for them so they don't have to go through  
this every time someone with a physical problem needs an 
accommodation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin has had an advantage, it hasn't been reflected on the  
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ruling, Martin's game has waned. After a top-10 finish  
four weeks ago, he has missed the cut in his last three 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Martin missed the cut at the Nike Lakeland Classic,  
an event he won in 1998, and finished 14th in his next tournament. 
After missing yet another cut, he took a month off and returned in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest success was a seventh-place tie good for $11,250 at  
the Nike Louisiana Open, but he followed that up with three missed 
cuts, culminating in last week's at the Nike Upstate Classic in 
Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the 26-year-old pro said he's got a lot of golf left to  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm playing well,'' he said as he left court. ``My leg  
hasn't been great, but I'm still able to play.''

<HEADLINE> Economic Indicators Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and signs of a backlog in  
the delivery of orders by vendors pushed a key gauge of future 
economic activity higher for the sixth straight month in March, 
signaling continued strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 
107.3 in March, up from a revised level of 107.2 in February. The 
results were in line with economist expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a normal-size increase for a single month,'' said  
Michael Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the 
Conference Board. ``But because the leading index is up 1.6 percent 
since September of last year, there is a lot of confidence that 
this expansion will continue at a robust pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The index of leading indicators is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	A backlog in delivery of goods indicates increased demand,  
helping to drive the index higher, Boldin said. A decline in 
building permits and consumer expectations limited the gain, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 43.81 at 10970.88 in  
early afternoon trading, one day after charging ahead 225 points to 
its first close above 11,000. Broader stock indicators were mixed. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 7.92 at 1,346.71, but the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 10.19 at 2,545.77. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board also reported that its coincident  
indicators, which measure current activity, rose 0.2 percent and 
the lagging index, which measures the economy's past performance, 
rose 0.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the board said the three index components show a  
healthy economy that will continue to expand through at least late 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned, with figures from past years revised.

threatens the essence of the centuries-old sport by giving an 
unfair advantage to one golfer, reasoning which Martin rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it easier for them so they don't have to go through  
this every time someone with a physical problem needs an 
accommodation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin has had an advantage, it hasn't been reflected on the  
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ruling, Martin's game has waned. After a top-10 finish  
four weeks ago, he has missed the cut in his last three 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Martin missed the cut at the Nike Lakeland Classic,  
an event he won in 1998, and finished 14th in his next tournament. 
After missing yet another cut, he took a month off and returned in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest success was a seventh-place tie good for $11,250 at  
the Nike Louisiana Open, but he followed that up with three missed 
cuts, culminating in last week's at the Nike Upstate Classic in 
Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the 26-year-old pro said he's got a lot of golf left to  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm playing well,'' he said as he left court. ``My leg  
hasn't been great, but I'm still able to play.''

<HEADLINE> 'Cabaret' Honored at Hayes Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The composer and lyricists of such popular  
musicals as ``Cabaret'' ``Chicago'' and ``Kiss of the Spider 
Woman'' were singled out for a special award at the annual Helen 
Hayes Awards at the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kander and Fred Ebb were presented the annual American  
Express Tribute by actress Liza Minnelli, who said: ``If anyone 
asked me what I'm proudest of in my career, it's the music written 
for me by Kander and Ebb.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Sidetracking Ground War Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain concedes most of his  
colleagues don't back his move to give President Clinton unsought 
authority to use ``all necessary force'' to win in Yugoslavia -- 
including ground troops if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Top administration officials joined with Senate leaders in  
urging senators to brush aside the attempt by McCain and a few 
other senators in a showdown vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican and GOP presidential hopeful,  
accused Clinton and his top national security advisers of working 
against their own interests in actively opposing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``But his irresponsibility does not excuse Congress,'' McCain  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., asked the Senate to ``table,'' or set 
aside, McCain's proposal -- a move that would end all Kosovo floor 
debate for now. Senators on both side of the aisle said the 
leadership motion would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the measure would nominally strengthen Clinton's  
hand, the White House, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
Defense Secretary William Cohen worked hard throughout Monday for 
its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its congressional allies feared that  
keeping the measure alive would open the way to a more contentious 
debate and more efforts to restrict presidential authority -- as the 
House had done last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted to require Clinton to seek advance congressional  
approval before injecting ``ground elements.'' And, on a 213-213 
tie, it even failed to support the ongoing NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation by McCain, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and five  
others would authorize the president to use ``all necessary force 
and other means'' to win in Kosovo. Ground troops weren't spelled 
out, but sponsors said that's what was intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making a horrible mistake here'' in not supporting a  
ground-troops option for Clinton, Biden told the Senate Monday 
night. ``We're not demanding that he use ground troops. We're 
saying to him, we want to make sure that you understand that you've 
got to win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a senior and influential  
Democratic member, called the McCain-Biden legislation ``a bold and 
possibly risky stroke,'' particularly since Clinton did not ask for 
authority to expand the military campaign with ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In filing his legislation, McCain unwittingly triggered a  
provision of the 1973 War Powers Act that required the resolution 
to be brought to the floor on Monday -- and to be acted on by no 
later than today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll showed that most Americans believe  
Congress should have the final authority to decide whether the 
United States should continue the current airstrikes in Kosovo or 
send in ground troops. However, the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll 
showed that 54 percent approve of the way Clinton has handled the 
situation in Kosovo, while only 41 percent say they approve of the 
way Congress has handled it. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for U.S. participation in the NATO airstrikes remains  
steady at 58 percent, with 41 percent saying they strongly favor 
the strikes and only 27 percent saying they strongly oppose them. 
Most Americans oppose sending U.S. ground troops into a combat 
situation in the region -- unchanged since April -- with 42 percent 
saying they strongly oppose that move. Two-thirds, however, favor 
sending U.S. ground troops to serve as peacekeepers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,014 adult Americans was conducted April 30-May  
2. Questions have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Take Control of PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The government is considering a  
temporary takeover of troubled Philippine Airlines to help it look 
for fresh capital and avoid being closed, President Joseph Estrada 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said the step would be a last resort if PAL chairman  
Lucio Tan is unable to raise the $200 million in new capital needed 
for its rehabilitation plan by an early June deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take over PAL if that is necessary,'' Estrada told  
reporters. ``The bottom line is, I want to see to it that PAL will 
continue flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the government would  
take over PAL's management but would not infuse money into the 
troubled carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada's administration has adopted a policy of not undertaking  
costly bailouts of beleaguered private and state-run companies. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL is mired in debts of more than $2.2 billion, of which more  
than two-thirds are owed to the U.S. and European credit agencies 
which helped finance the airline's ambitious but ill-timed fleet 
modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital infusion is a key element of a rehabilitation plan  
that also calls for cutting the airline's fleet to 22 planes from 
54 and slashing the labor force to about 3,000 from 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL submitted additional details of the plan on Tuesday, meeting  
a deadline set by Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission. The 
SEC had earlier rejected the plan for being too vague and failing 
to identify potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, PAL's new document did not identify any interested  
investors other than Tan and did not divulge the basis for its 
future income projections as sought by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC will review the filing and decide later whether it is  
sufficient. PAL's management must also meet a June 4 SEC deadline 
for it to come up with the $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay has said he will order the  
liquidation of PAL if the capital is not raised by the deadline and 
other key requirements of the rehabilitation plan are not met. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's major creditors, including the U.S. Export-Import  
bank and European export credit agencies, initially backed the plan 
but threatened to scuttle it after Tan reassumed direct management 
control of the airline last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The creditors have said they want PAL run by professional  
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, one of the country's richest men, owns 70 percent of the  
airline and has interests in banking, beer and tobacco. He was a 
major contributor to Estrada's campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan has said he is willing to organize a group of investors to  
raise the $200 million and pledged to provide half of the total 
himself, but the government is uncertain whether he can do so by 
the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan was set to fly to Germany to try to woo Deutsche Lufthansa  
AG to help recapitalize PAL, Trade and Industry Secretary Jose 
Pardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fallback for Tan's efforts, the government has begun talks  
with two other potential investors, Pardo said, but declined to 
give details.

<HEADLINE> At Least 43 Die in Plains Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Rescue crews looking for signs of life  
picked through shattered homes, twisted trees and mangled cars 
Tuesday after a swarm of astonishingly powerful tornadoes chewed up 
entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and Kansas and killed at least 43 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an area accustomed to twisters and strong thunderstorms  
-- this is, after all, the region known as Tornado Alley, and spring 
is an especially dangerous time of year -- the twisters' wrath was 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	One monstrous funnel cloud skipped across the ground for four  
hours and was classified F-5, the most powerful tornado there is, 
with winds of more than 260 mph. It cut a path one mile wide, and 
along with the other twisters tore up 60 miles of the flat 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is crazy,'' said Eric Peterson of Haysville, Kan., a  
suburb of Wichita, after a twister pushed a tree into his bedroom. 
``I have been in typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricanes, 
but this tops it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes were spawned by a string of extreme thunderstorms  
that unleashed 76 twisters in 5 states on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll was 38 in Oklahoma and five in Kansas, including  
a month-old baby in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	The same system produced a tornado in northeast Texas on  
Tuesday, leaving one person dead. In southern Arkansas, 
thunderstorms spawned tornadoes, large hail and heavy rain, leaving 
thousands of people without electricity. Several houses and a 
church were damaged. There were no immediate reports of any 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's tornado outbreak was the nation's deadliest since 42  
people were killed last year in Florida. It was also the deadliest 
such tragedy to hit Oklahoma since 1947, when a twister killed 113 
people in Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were injured, including 500 in Oklahoma City and more  
than 100 in Wichita. At least 1,500 businesses and homes were 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars were tossed across highways and crushed like soda cans.  
Houses were smashed into piles of splintered timbers and brick. The 
ground was scoured bare in places, stripped of trees. The air 
smelled like sawdust. Baby pictures floated down the streets in 
storm water. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City, likened  
the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing in 1995: ``It looks like 
the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories tall, it's spread 
out over a large area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the death toll could have been worse if people  
had not heeded warnings to take cover underground. Local TV 
stations went live with coverage of the developing storm at least 
two hours before it hit the heavily populated Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating estimated that hundreds of millions  
of dollars of damage was done. He mobilized the National Guard to 
help with the rescue, and tanks joined police and fire vehicles in 
blocking streets where the heaviest destruction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers conducted two preliminary searches for victims, then  
brought in bulldozers to clear away heavy debris in a third search 
during the afternoon. At least one woman was found alive in a 
trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be someone, somewhere, still out there, under the  
clutter,'' said John Vears, one of the hundreds of volunteer 
searchers and emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most homes in Oklahoma are built on concrete slabs and don't  
have cellars where people can take shelter. When a tornado draws 
near, people are urged to take shelter in a structurally sound, 
centrally located space in the house, such as a bathroom, a closet 
or under a staircase. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dennis McCarthy, chief meteorologist for the National  
Weather Service in Norman, said some deaths may have been 
unavoidable. ``With a storm of this intensity and this magnitude, 
sometimes even if you do the right things, sometime you just don't 
have enough shelter,'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Knapp, a Red Cross volunteer at an evacuation shelter in  
Newcastle, said she was taking her son to T-ball practice but 
turned around when a funnel cloud came into view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in several of them in my lifetime. But this was a  
big one,'' she said. ``This did more damage than I've ever seen in 
my life. There are dead cattle in people's yard, trees, debris. 
Grass was ripped up. At some homes, the foundations were ripped 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Smith was visiting her grandparents when a tornado tore  
through her neighborhood in Midwest City, just outside Oklahoma 
City. She spent Tuesday rummaging through the remains of what once 
was her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got here, I could only tell it was our house because  
of the bushes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Poahty was still in shock as she looked at her neighbor's  
car, which had been hurled into her living room. Her son's mattress 
was in a tree and the family car was 100 yards away in a neighbor's 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
	She was able to salvage something, however: She found a small  
black bag on the floor, opened it and pulled out a glass bottle. 
``My perfume survived,'' she said. ``It was my favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated the tornadoes traveled as much as 80 miles  
after forming 45 miles south of Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon. 
Over the next 20 hours, as many as four dozen tornadoes developed. 
The same system spawned the Kansas tornado, which struck about 8:30 
p.m. Monday. It cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Wichita, about 270 homes and businesses were  
damaged, including about 100 homes in two lakeside trailer parks. 
At least 150 houses and 27 businesses were damaged or destroyed in 
Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Zehr, 44, figured he would be safe inside the  
cinderblock warehouse where he was working when the tornado struck 
Haysville. Then he was lifted 4 feet in the air and dropped back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I couldn't breathe,'' he said. ``The wind was  
knocked out of me. The roof fell on me. The wall fell on me.'' He 
marveled at how he survived with merely a bruised finger. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared disaster areas in 11 Oklahoma  
counties and one Kansas county and plans to tour the devastation 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the surreal images in the aftermath of the storm:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In a high school parking lot next to a row of flattened  
houses, a dead gray horse lay between cars after being been blown 
in from the surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Officials reported that part of a wing apparently snapped off  
a small plane parked at a rural airport and drifted for 40 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Knerr, 73, sat in the Midwest City Senior Center,  
mud-stained and slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the war in Germany. I've had bombs fall all  
around me. Now I've been in a tornado,'' she said. ``It's a feeling 
I can't describe. Everything was falling on me, two-by-fours and 
insulation.''

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma, Kansas in Tornado Alley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death and devastation inflicted on  
Oklahoma and Kansas illustrates once again why the region is called 
Tornado Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual to have tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas at  
this time of year. It is unusual to have 76 (reports of) tornadoes 
over multiple states in a seven-hour period,'' said John Jones, 
deputy director of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The vicious twisting winds that can destroy anything in their  
path occur more often in this region than anywhere else, the result 
of a unique combination of geography and climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, dry air from America's West meets warm, moist air flowing  
north from the Gulf of Mexico. As happened Monday, this encounter 
can turn violent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what conditions were there to bring about the  
thunderstorms and tornadoes, but to say why there was such a large 
outbreak, no we don't know. ... There was no way for us, or anyone, 
to know there would be'' so many tornadoes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes aren't exclusive to Tornado Alley. They have struck in  
every state and can occur at any time of the year, though they 
prefer the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In concentration of tornadoes, Oklahoma tops the nation. Between  
1880 and 1989, it had 19.7 tornadoes per 10,000 square miles, the 
most in the nation, according to calculations done by researcher 
Thomas P. Grazulis in his massive study, ``Significant Tornadoes 
1880-1989.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to the most violent storms -- F5 on the Fujita  
scale -- Kansas has recorded the most with 12 over that period, 
Grazulis reported. The Fujita scale ranks the damage done by 
twisters on a scale of F0-F5, with F5 the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Jones explained, there was a dry line on the ground,  
a north-south line with dry air to the west, moist air to the east. 
Overhead there were strong winds blowing from the south and 
southwest between 5,000 feet and 10,000 feet, while above that, up 
to 20,000 feet, the winds were from the west. Warm, moist air 
originating in the Gulf of Mexico was pulled upward by the strong 
overhead winds. 
</P>
<P>
	As moist air rises, the water condenses into clouds. When they  
encounter the area of shear -- where winds are moving in different 
directions -- the clouds can begin to spin into a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not rare to have one or two of these ingredients, it's  
not rare to have all three of them at the same time, to have them 
produce thunderstorms and a few tornadoes,'' Jones said, ``But to 
get this type of outbreak is rare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By most definitions, Tornado Alley extends from north-central  
Texas through central Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska into the 
Dakotas, the north-south line where moist and dry air collide time 
after time. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is another focus for heavy tornado activity, both early  
in the spring as warming conditions bring battling air masses 
there, and later in the year when hurricanes can spawn twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	A third tornado focus is the so-called Dixie Alley, which runs  
from northeast Texas to northern Alabama, then skips over the 
southern Appalachians and reforms in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	While Oklahoma has the greatest concentration of tornadoes and  
Kansas is struck by the most violent ones, Texas is far and away 
the most twister-prone state. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1950 and 1994, federal records show 5,490 tornadoes  
reported in the Lone Star State. Oklahoma came second at 2,300, 
followed by Kansas with 2,110 and Florida with 2,009. 
</P>
<P>
	Others with 1,000 tornadoes or more during that period were  
Nebraska, 1,673; Iowa, 1,374; Missouri, 1,166; South Dakota, 1,139; 
Illinois, 1,137; Colorado, 1,113; Louisiana, 1,086, and 
Mississippi, 1,039.

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man who has admitted  
selling a semiautomatic handgun to the two Columbine student gunmen 
had gone shooting in the woods with the two before the school 
massacre, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, a computer programmer, fired weapons with Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold three times within the month prior to the 
rampage that left 15 dead, said attorney Robert Ransome. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes thought he was just spending time with fellows who just  
enjoyed shooting, and ``did not know this was going to happen,'' 
Ransome said. ``Mark's family is extremely devastated about what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they do not know if Manes was aware of what the  
gun would be used for. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a handgun to  
a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in prison. Ransome 
said his client was talking to prosecutors and hoped to avoid a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said his client bought the pistol at a gun show last  
fall. He later met Harris and Klebold through a mutual 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the attorney said. ``Mark was not friends with Eric and Dylan. He 
did not hang out with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not give specifics on where they went out shooting,  
whether Manes sold ammunition to the pair, the sale price of the 
gun, what his client may have known about the law involving sales 
to minor, or who else might have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, detectives kept up their search for those who may  
have known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an  
eager but uneasy return to class Monday at nearby Chatfield High 
School. Chatfield students had class in the morning, Columbine 
students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend  
Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest 
of the year. The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was  
released from jail after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance next  
Monday, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on 
charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and 
a shotgun -- and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado 
law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with 
rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still trying to find others who may have known the  
killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a 
third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good  
possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the 
school that day,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and 
the TEC DC-9 pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the  
anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. 
Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application 
for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly 
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to 
treat depression.

<HEADLINE> Man Held In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The man who sold a semiautomatic handgun  
to the two Columbine High killers went shooting with them in the 
woods three times in the month before the bloodbath, the man's 
lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, admitted selling the semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to  
one of the teen-agers but did not know it would be used in the 
April 20 attack that left 15 dead, including the gunmen, said 
attorney Robert Ransome. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're up shooting in the woods with a bunch of kids who  
love to shoot at things, the obvious assumption is, `Hey, they like 
guns and they like to shoot,''' Ransome said. ``He never got to 
that point, thinking what they might do with it. It just never 
crossed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a computer programmer and former Columbine student, was  
booked on suspicion of providing a handgun to a minor, punishable 
by up to six years in prison. His lawyer is trying to work out a 
deal with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome would not say whether Manes sold the two teen-agers  
ammunition, how much he charged for the gun, where they went 
shooting, who else accompanied them or what Manes may have known 
about the law involving gun sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine on  
April 20, hurling explosives and blasting away with four guns. They 
killed 13 people and wounding 23 students before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	They used the TEC DC-9 purchased from Manes in late February and  
three guns -- two shotguns and a rifle -- that had been legally 
purchased by Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Colorado law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can  
furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. Investigators have 
characterized Miss Anderson as a witness, not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Harris and Klebold were the only two  
gunmen but are looking at the possibility that others may have been 
involved in the conspiracy. They are also performing ballistics 
tests to determine which weapons fired the fatal shots; Manes could 
face more serious charges if the TEC DC-9 was used to kill someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is the first person arrested and connected to the school  
attack. He bought the pistol at a gun show last fall, Ransome said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the lawyer said. ``Mark was not friends with Eric and Dylan. He did 
not hang out with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the middleman was a pizza shop employee who  
worked with Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times in the month prior to April 20, the three, joined by  
an unspecified number of other people, went into the woods, 
``shooting automatic weapons,'' Ransome said. He would not if the 
weapons were fully automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Automatic weapons, which fire continuously as long the trigger  
is down, are illegal. Semiautomatic weapons fire once with every 
pull of the trigger. But semiautomatic pistols are sometimes 
loosely referred to as ``automatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A homemade video obtained by investigators shows Harris and  
Klebold practicing with weapons in a mountain setting, supposedly 
with two men and a woman, the Denver Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said Manes has cooperated with authorities but does not  
know of any other person who may have been involved in the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes attended Columbine for 1 1/2 years before transferring to an  
alternative high school. He later attended Arapahoe Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Michael and Diane, are longtime gun opponents who  
have never kept a weapon in the home, Ransome said. Mrs. Manes 
belongs to a coalition that lobbies for gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	As Columbine students attended classes a second day at Chatfield  
Senior High School, workers began dismantling a huge makeshift 
memorial of flowers, stuffed animals, balloons, cards and letters 
honoring the shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the flowers left at small memorials throughout the  
240-acre park next to the school will be donated to the Littleton 
Fire Department, where they will be turned into potpourri for 
Columbine students. 
</P>
<P>
	Teddy bears, notes, posters, silk flowers and other mementos  
will be stored in boxes and catalogued for a permanent memorial 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Pomering, a neighborhood resident, said it's time for the  
temporary memorial to come down: ``The longer it stays, the harder 
it is for the families.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Steel Efforts Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's efforts to combat unfair  
steel shipments from Japan and other countries are showing dramatic 
results and will take the steam out of a congressional drive to 
limit steel imports, the administration's top trade official 
predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said steel was a  
key discussion item when Clinton met Monday with Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton repeated earlier warnings that if Japan's steel  
shipments, which surged over the past two years, do not return to 
levels in effect before 1997, the administration will pursue its 
own trade sanction cases against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to jawboning Japan, the administration negotiated an  
agreement with Russia to restrict steel shipments voluntarily and 
is expediting a number of cases filed by the domestic industry that 
will impose high tariffs on steel determined to be sold in the 
United States at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we have undertaken actions that have brought steel  
import volumes way down, back to pre-crisis levels in many 
instances,'' Barshefsky told the Society of American Business 
Writers and Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports into the United States rose by 25 percent in  
March, but that increase followed four consecutive months of steep 
declines. Even with the March increase, steel imports remained 30 
percent below what they were in November. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the House voted 289-141 for legislation that would  
impose global quotas on steel shipments into the United States. The 
proposal is pending in the Senate. The U.S. industry is lobbying 
for the passage of the measure to combat a flood of imports it 
blames for the loss of thousands of American jobs in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky on Tuesday repeated the administration's view that  
the quota bill is clearly in violation of global trade rules 
administered by the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she would continue to urge a presidential veto on the  
grounds that the United States as the world's largest exporter ran 
a great risk of retaliation from other countries if it sought to 
erect protectionist barriers in violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be a quota bill ultimately presented  
to the president,'' Barshefsky told the business writers' group. 
``I think the president's program has been working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that assessment was disputed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., who said at a separate appearance Tuesday that he believed 
the Senate was ``very close to being able to do what the House 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, a key supporter of restricting foreign steel, said  
he believed the Senate could vote in ``another week or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries have become worried about growing protectionist  
pressure in Congress because of the soaring U.S. trade deficit. The 
deficit hit a record $169 billion last year and is headed higher in 
1999 as American manufacturers and farmers continue to suffer from 
a global financial crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe 
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi wrapped up his visit to Washington on Tuesday with  
meetings on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters the  
discussions covered trade and other economic issues as well as 
Japan's support for U.S. efforts in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with House members, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman  
of the House International Relations Committee, gave Obuchi a 
report recommending that the United States, Japan and South Korea 
jointly establish an early warning system to guard against 
ballistic missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All three nations face a common threat from North Korea, which  
has developed dangerous medium- and long-range missile systems 
despite international sanctions,'' Gilman said in a statement. 
``The time has come for us to coordinate the defense of all three 
countries against this threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Clinton-Obuchi summit meetings Monday, the two  
countries announced a package of agreements aimed at boosting sales 
prospects in Japan for American telecommunications, drug, financial 
service and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of those agreements, which would boost cooperation on  
antitrust issues, was attacked at a Senate Judiciary Committee 
hearing Tuesday by senators who warned that Japan has not lived up 
to previous agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the Japanese say all the right things and sign all  
the right agreements, their keiretsu (linkage of businesses) of 
manufacturers and distributors has made it impossible for hard 
working companies to bring competitive products to Japan,'' said 
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said that as an alternative, the U.S.  
Justice Department should consider bringing enforcement cases 
against Japanese firms judged to be violating American antitrust 
laws.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Falling; Dow Down 110.25 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were tumbling lower in late afternoon, as  
a runup in interest rates prompted investors to reverse a buying 
spree on Monday that sent the Dow industrials above 11,000 for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 110.25, just more than 1 percent, at 10,904.44. That was still 
less than half of Monday's 225-point gain to 11,014.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were still catching their breath after the leap from  
10,000 past 11,000. Taking just 24 trading days, it represented the 
fastest rise ever between 1,000-point milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of the two steps forward, one step back that the  
market has been engaged in lately,'' said Charles White, portfolio 
manager at Avatar Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower after a mixed morning. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 19.38 at 1,335.25, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was off 30.06 at 2,505.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Hogan, market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston,  
agreed that today's losses were ``not a scary hit; I'll take that 
any day of the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason was that, despite the drop in the Dow, advancing  
issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
volume came to 754.89 million shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, blue-chip shares fell with bond prices, after two more  
reports today reinforcing a strong economic outlook. The 30-year 
Treasury bond was down sharply, pushing its yield up to 5.72 
percent from 5.65 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported that a key gauge of future  
economic activity rose for the sixth straight month in March. The 
research group's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 
percent in March, in line with economists' predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a confirmation that the housing market remains robust,  
the Commerce Department reported that completion of privately owned 
housing units rose 12.6 percent in March, the fasted pace since 
April 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures fed fears that the Federal Reserve might be  
inclined to raise interest rates in a bid to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial shares were big losers among blue-chip Dow  
components. General Motors skidded 3 5/8 to 90 1/8. And financial stocks 
fell with bond prices. American Express was down 4 13/16 at 128 
9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldman Sachs shares soared to 72 1/4 in leading volume on the  
Big Board, after the investment firm sold 69 million shares at $53 
apiece in an initial public offering on Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man who has admitted  
selling a semiautomatic handgun to the two Columbine student gunmen 
had gone shooting in the woods with the two before the school 
massacre, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, a computer programmer, fired weapons with Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold three times within the month prior to the 
rampage that left 15 dead, said attorney Robert Ransome. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes thought he was just spending time with fellows who just  
enjoyed shooting, and ``did not know this was going to happen,'' 
Ransome said. ``Mark's family is extremely devastated about what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they do not know if Manes was aware of what the  
gun would be used for. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a handgun to  
a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in prison. Ransome 
said his client was talking to prosecutors and hoped to avoid a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said his client bought the pistol at a gun show last  
fall. He later met Harris and Klebold through a mutual 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the attorney said. ``Mark was not friends with Eric and Dylan. He 
did not hang out with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not give specifics on where they went out shooting,  
whether Manes sold ammunition to the pair, the sale price of the 
gun, what his client may have known about the law involving sales 
to minor, or who else might have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, detectives kept up their search for those who may  
have known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an  
eager but uneasy return to class Monday at nearby Chatfield High 
School. Chatfield students had class in the morning, Columbine 
students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend  
Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest 
of the year. The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was  
released from jail after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance next  
Monday, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on 
charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and 
a shotgun -- and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado 
law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with 
rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still trying to find others who may have known the  
killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a 
third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good  
possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the 
school that day,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and 
the TEC DC-9 pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the  
anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. 
Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application 
for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly 
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to 
treat depression.

<HEADLINE> Online Broker Accountability Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's top securities regulator,  
noting that ads for online trading often resemble lottery 
commercials, is urging Internet brokerages to better warn their 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Explaining clearly to customers ... would go a long way toward  
reducing the complaints pouring into the SEC, Congress and firms,'' 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To every online firm, I challenge you to meaningfully  
communicate with your customers,'' Levitt said in a speech at the 
National Press Club. ``Talk in realistic terms; let them know their 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an SEC review of online brokerage account agreements  
found that ``almost none'' of them discuss trading risks or what 
customers should do if there is a computer system outage. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC chief also said online firms need to ensure they have  
adequate computer system capacity to handle the swarms of new 
customers, asserting that the brokers have a legal obligation to 
provide efficient execution of trading orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he's not convinced the market watchdog agency needs  
a new set of regulations for online investing, but he did not rule 
out that possibility in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized advertisements by some Internet brokers which  
he said more closely resemble commercials for the playing the 
lottery by promising quick riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's bull market there may be an increasing population  
of tow-truck drivers who now own their own islands as a result of 
online investing. ... (But) I'm worried these commercials step over 
the line and border on irresponsibility,'' he said, referring to 
one widely aired ad campaign on television, Levitt said, 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's remarks come as the SEC and the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, a self-policing brokers' group, have been 
investigating online brokerages nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to looking for violations of securities laws, the  
investigators are examining how well firms execute orders and warn 
customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said SEC auditors already have inspected online firms  
representing 80 percent of the electronic-trading market. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say that by year's end, 10 million amateur investors  
will be trading at least occasionally over the Internet, and online 
customers will account for about a quarter of all retail stock 
trades. The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab, 
E-Trade Group, Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect and Discover 
Brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also expressed concern about that rising popularity of  
day trading, a practice in which investors scope out fast-moving 
stocks, buying and selling them quickly to profit from the sudden 
price swings. Many day-trading companies sell training courses and 
special software to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing day-trading opportunities is not itself against the  
law, but these firms should be on notice that they ... must operate 
within the existing rules,'' Levitt said. He added that firms 
should ensure that their day-trading strategies are suitable for 
customers' financial circumstances and trading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galvin, Massachusetts' secretary of state, announced  
Monday a settlement with All-Tech Investment Group in which the big 
day-trading firm agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse 
customers $228,000. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the  
settlement, but agreed not to sign up any new customers in the 
state for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of day-trading firms acknowledge that the strategy is  
not right for everyone, but contend state regulators are unfairly 
tarnishing the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have 
misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Moehler Suspended 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Moehler would rather pitch  
than fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit right-hander said Monday that he won't appeal his  
10-day suspension for doctoring baseballs, adding that it would be 
in the best interests of him and the team to try to put last 
weekend's incident to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we appeal or don't appeal, people have their own  
opinions,'' Moehler said after being notified of the penalty by AL 
president Gene Budig on Monday. ``It comes down to me wanting to 
pitch and soon. I think that's the best thing to do and just move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension came two days after Moehler was ejected from a  
game against Tampa Bay by umpire Larry Barnett, who said the 
pitcher was doctoring baseballs with sandpaper during a 4-3 loss to 
the Devil Rays on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, 27, said it wasn't sandpaper, merely dirt, but said he  
didn't protest his ejection because it's not his nature to ``argue 
until I'm blue in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True to his nature, he notified the players association not to  
appeal Budig's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tough for me because I'm a competitor and I want to  
pitch,'' Moehler said. ``I want to be out there pitching. The 
toughest part is, you don't feel like you're contributing to the 
team. I just have to keep my head up and go out there and get my 
work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, the plate umpire, said he found a small piece of  
sandpaper attached to the pitcher's left thumb after the Devil Rays 
complained he appeared to be scuffing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler allowed three runs on four hits in the first two  
innings, but Tampa Bay managed just hit the next four innings. The 
Devil Rays said the speed and movement of Moehler's pitches changed 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was darting and breaking all over the place,'' slugger Jose  
Canseco said, ``and it was breaking late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said he didn't derive any  
satisfaction out of getting Moehler thrown out of the game and 
later suspended, but added ``the rules are clearly stated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Section 3.02 of the Official Baseball Rules calls for the 10-day  
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was suspended  
for 10 days by NL president A. Bartlett Giamatti after Gross was 
caught with sandpaper in his glove. That same year, AL president 
Bobby Brown suspended Minnesota pitcher Joe Niekro for 10 days for 
carrying an emery board and sandpaper in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, 3-3 with a 4.23 ERA, said he's prepared for the  
attention he will likely receive from fans around the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city I go into this year, I'm going to hear something  
from somebody,'' the pitcher said. ``It's going to happen. I'm 
prepared for it. You have leather skin and you keep moving on.''

<HEADLINE> Griffey Gets Dad's Help With Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. knew his swing needed help and  
he knew exactly where to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	He went home and saw his dad.  
</P>
<P>
	Junior spent a half-hour of his day off at Cinergy Field on  
Tuesday, letting his father, Ken, toss him balls and give him 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows my swing better than anybody,'' Junior said. ``I just  
wanted him to tell me what I was doing wrong. I've been fighting 
myself for the last two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junior has nine homers, 24 RBIs and a .287 average, but has  
struggled in his few opportunities against left-handed pitchers. 
He's only 5-for-28 (.179) with one homer against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle off Tuesday before a two-game series in Cleveland,  
Junior had planned to get together with his family in his hometown 
before heading north. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, a coach with the Reds, got a hint that it would be more  
than just a social visit when Junior called and asked about his 
plans -- other than seeing his two grandchildren, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	``His excuse was he's bringing the kids in,'' Griffey said,  
smiling. ``But I knew what it was when he wanted to come in early. 
I knew he probably wanted me to throw to him, to try to correct 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey got his son started on baseball at the age of 5 and  
often gets a call when Junior's swing is out of whack. He asked for 
his dad's help Tuesday because he's been slow getting the bat 
around against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, who throws left-handed, tossed him balls for about a  
half-hour in a batting cage under the stands before the Reds' game 
against Arizona. Griffey asked some questions and gave a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Mainly, they talked.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much the swing, it's how he thinks,'' Griffey  
said. ``When I played, my thinking was how quick can I get out of 
it when I'm having problems at the plate so instead of going 
0-for-25, I may go 0-for-10 and then get a hit and start hitting 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are off Thursday, so Griffey plans to join his son in  
Cleveland and throw him another round of batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 49, was part of the Big Red Machine that won  
consecutive World Series in 1975-76. He hit .296 during his major 
league career, which ended after he teamed up with his son in 
Seattle in 1990-91. They became the first father-son tandem to hit 
consecutive homers in a game on Sept. 14, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While his father was an All-Star outfielder for the Reds, Junior  
became a prep star in Cincinnati and was the Mariners' top draft 
pick. Junior kept in close touch with his family, and his father 
knew whenever his son was in a slump because the phone would ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been doing it ever since he's been in the game,'' Griffey  
said. ``We'll talk about something he's doing wrong and I'll kind 
of give him a question that he already knows the answer to. It's 
just a mental thing where it clicks and he says, ``Dad says this, 
so I'm doing this, so I'm OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a dad first before anything,'' Junior said. ``If I'm  
swinging bad, he'll call me.''

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Buys New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Heard the buzz about Rosie O'Donnell's  
dream house? 
</P>
<P>
	With her deal to buy Madonna's South Florida mansion now  
collapsed, the talk show host has settled for other digs that 
authorities say once housed a commune for a 70-ton marijuana 
smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell spent $6.75 million for the five-bedroom home on Star  
Island, which is also home to Gloria and Emilio Estefan and German 
developer Thomas Kramer. Built in 1923, it has a guest cottage, 
maid's quarters and pool. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same house from which the now defunct Zion Coptic  
Church ran a massive marijuana trafficking ring in the 1970s. In a 
1979 trial, church members showed up in crimson robes and 
green-and-gold uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended the colorful church was a cover for a huge  
smuggling operation and members smoked marijuana as a sacrament.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Owner, Coach Fined by NHL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL fined Philadelphia Flyers chairman Ed  
Snider $50,000 and coach Roger Neilson $25,000 for criticism of 
league officials and officiating following the team's playoff loss 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs by  
Toronto on Sunday, losing the final game 1-0 when the Maple Leafs 
scored on a power play in the final minute of regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider unleashed a furious postgame tirade against referee Terry  
Gregson for calling the late penalty on Philadelphia's John 
LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the official decides a game, it's a disgrace,'' Snider  
screamed. ``Everybody in the stands knows what that guy did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand I'm going to get fined, and I don't care how much  
I get fined. The truth is there. Everybody in the stands knows it. 
Everybody in the city knows it. It's a disgrace to the game. If 
Gregson can sleep tonight, God bless him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fines were levied Tuesday in accordance with the league's  
constitution and by-laws, which specifically prohibit public 
statements critical of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson didn't seem particularly upset by the fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lunch definitely isn't on us,'' he said. ``I don't know, I  
think we're probably going to have to raise our registration (fees) 
at our hockey camps to try to cover this. I mean, 25-grand, wow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our say -- and we probably shouldn't have -- and so you  
have to pay the penalty for it,'' he said. ``That's the way it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on the fines, Snider said Tuesday, ``I've said  
enough already. For right now, I have no comment.''

<HEADLINE> Smith-De Bruin Drug Ban Hearing Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An international arbitration panel  
ended its appeal hearing Tuesday of a four-year drug ban imposed on 
triple Olympic gold medalist Michelle Smith-De Bruin, with a plea 
from her lawyer to overturn the punishment and award the swimmer 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her entire life has been turned upside down,'' said lawyer  
Peter Lennon. ``Before these charges she was an athlete held in 
high repute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon renewed accusations that there were major flaws in the  
testing procedures which led to Smith-De Bruin being expelled from 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in this  
particular case,'' he told the three-man International Court of 
Arbitration for Sport, as his client listened nervously. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribunal chairman Yves Fortier refused to say when the verdict  
of the two-day hearing would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the fullness of time, the parties will be informed  
of our award. The ball is now in our court,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimming world governing body, FINA, imposed the ban last  
August after accusing Smith-De Bruin of tampering with an 
out-of-competition urine test taken at her Irish home, 
contaminating it with large amounts of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish swimmer denied the charge and appealed the ban which  
would disqualify her from the 2000 Olympics and 2001 World 
Championships and effectively end her career. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA lawyer Jean-Pierre Morand dismissed claims by Smith-de  
Bruin that someone else had manipulated the sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a single element of concrete evidence,'' he said  
in his closing argument. He maintained that the culprit ``could 
only be the appellant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the evidence at Tuesday's hearing focused on whether it  
was possible to tamper with the urine sample container without 
leaving signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Bonfanti, who works for the Lausanne Forensic Institute  
which conducted the tests, said her experiments to open three 
sample containers all left marks. But the proof wasn't conclusive, 
she told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible there is another method which enables the  
canister to be opened without leaving a trace','' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a test conducted in Britain showed it was  
possible to open and close containers used to transport urine 
samples without leaving any marks simply by immersing them in 
boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had a mediocre record before capturing three gold medals  
and a bronze at the Atlanta Games, three years after Erik de Bruin 
became her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Her marriage to de Bruin, the Dutch discus and shot put champion  
banned for four years after testing positive to excessive 
testosterone, stirred speculation that her rise had been aided by 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she had been tested more often than her rivals and  
each time the result was negative. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing summary, Lennon said Smith-De Bruin had no need  
to take performance-enhancing drugs because at the time of the 
fateful test she was recovering from a road traffic injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug testers weren't qualified and the procedures  
were wrong. In addition to overturning the ban, FINA should pay 
court costs and award undisclosed damages, Lennon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``FINA has been looking to get Michelle de Bruin for a very  
considerable period of time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- All American guard Richard Hamilton  
apparently is leaving national champion Connecticut for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton called a news conference for today and was expected to  
announce he is passing up his final year of eligibility and would 
make himself available for next month's draft.

<HEADLINE> Colorado, Detroit Ready for Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After a one-year hiatus, the Western Conference's  
fiercest playoff rivalry is ready to resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche earned a second-round date with the  
Detroit Red Wings by eliminating the San Jose Sharks with a 3-2 
overtime victory in Game 6 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for the focus to shift from the Sharks to  
the Red Wings, who have won back-to-back Stanley Cup titles 
following Colorado's championship in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to relax, but I guess you're not going to let  
me,'' Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy said when he was asked about 
Detroit. ``We're going to have to sit down all together and talk 
about it and get ready for Game 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit-Colorado series opens Friday night in Denver, and if  
past encounters are any indication, it should be filled with 
controversy, cross-checks and contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche eliminated the Red Wings en route to the Stanley  
Cup in 1996 as the series hit one of its many emotional peaks. 
Colorado's Claude Lemieux became the centerpiece of the rivalry in 
Game 6 when he checked Kris Draper into the boards along the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Draper needed reconstructive facial surgery, and Red Wings coach  
Scotty Bowman later confronted Lemieux and his family in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit got on-ice revenge by eliminating Colorado in 1997. The  
playoff series followed a late-season brawl between the two teams, 
and they repeated the full-scale slugfest in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News already has a survey asking readers to name  
their least-favorite Avalanche player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen their games on TV, and I'm looking forward to  
playing in that,'' said Ulf Samuelsson, who was traded to Detroit 
in March. ``That's a great team and I think it's going to be a 
great series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks nearly spoiled the anticipated clash, erasing a 2-0  
deficit to tie the opening series with back-to-back victories in 
Denver. Colorado regrouped and avoided a repeat of last year's 
first-round collapse against Edmonton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had adversity in this one,'' Lemieux said. ``You win four  
straight in the first round, you face adversity against a club like 
Detroit, maybe you can't rebound. But we had adversity, and we're 
going to have more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Avalanche fought to get past San Jose, the Red Wings  
have had a long layoff after sweeping Anaheim. Their last game was 
April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too long,'' Detroit's Larry Murphy said. ``Three or four  
days is nice, but anything longer than that is too long. Time 
really ticks by slowly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It shouldn't take more than a blind-side body check to help the  
Red Wings return to reality. Lemieux and Draper remain on opposite 
ends, and Roy and Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood will continue a 
personal rivalry that intensified when they met at center ice and 
exchanged punches last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Samuelsson, Colorado center Theo Fleury can't wait to join  
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't gotten to play Detroit as an Av. I'm excited,'' said  
Fleury, who had three goals and two assists in the final two games 
of the San Jose series. ``I have to hear about it every day.''

<HEADLINE> Caldera Answers Microsoft Motions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Caldera Inc., a small Utah company suing  
Microsoft for alleged antitrust violations, says the software 
giant's internal documents show it used misleading statements to 
discourage customers from buying Caldera's product. 
</P>
<P>
	In filings with U.S. District Court here on Monday, Caldera said  
the documents demonstrate that Microsoft used misleading product 
announcements, known in the industry as ``vaporware,'' to dampen 
sales and reduce interest in DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	DR-DOS is a program that enables computers to perform basic  
functions, and Caldera contends Microsoft deliberately destroyed 
public demand for the program. One of Caldera's expert witnesses 
has calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's filings were in response to Microsoft's request in  
January for the judge to make a summary judgment to throw out nine 
separate issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Dee Benson has scheduled five hearings  
on the motions starting May 25. The case began nearly three years 
ago and is scheduled for a jury trial in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, which is based in Orem, Utah, also claims Microsoft  
used misleading statements about DR-DOS to create fear, uncertainty 
and doubt; used licensing terms to block out DR-DOS; intentionally 
created incompatibilities and the perception of incompatibilities 
to hurt DR-DOS in the marketplace, and ``black listed'' Novell, 
which previously owned DR-DOS, from access to a Windows test to 
hinder compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
	It also claims that Windows 95 is just MS-DOS and Windows  
packaged together to eliminate the possibility of the customer 
buying a competing DOS to run the new Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft claims that internal memos show DR-DOS's developers  
knew they had a flawed product and poor technical support for 
frustrated consumers.

<HEADLINE> Parents Eager About Kids on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet may hold extraordinary promise  
for children, but their parents also carry deep fears about its 
possible influence, says a new survey released today about kids and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found this incredible conflict,'' said Joseph Turow, who  
wrote the report for the Annenberg Public Policy Center. ``People 
trust their kids with the Internet, but they don't trust the 
Internet with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, being released today in Washington, suggest  
a Jekyll-and-Hyde view by parents of the Internet, where graphic 
sexual photos are merely mouse-clicks away from children's Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is there,'' agreed Darlene Maloney, president of  
the Indiana Parent Teachers Association. ``You read about all the 
garbage that happened to this one and that one, and they're 
fearful. They're learning it can be your friend as well as your 
enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Mrs. Maloney's six children still live at home and use  
the Internet regularly, in part to send e-mail to their grown 
siblings who live in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study divides parents into three groups based on their  
reactions to specific statements about the Internet, such as, ``My 
children's exposure to the Internet might interfere with the values 
and beliefs I want to teach them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow said 39 percent of parents can be described as ``online  
worriers,'' who are convinced of both the happy and scary elements 
of the Internet and most concerned about the impact of the Web on 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The same percentage of parents are ``gung ho'' about the  
Internet, enthusiastic about the Web and rejecting nearly all 
statements about its alleged negative effects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turow described other parents as ``disenchanted,'' not at all  
convinced about the Internet's value for children. Just over half 
these parents agree that the Internet can help kids with their 
homework, and only 28 percent agreed with the statement, ``The 
Internet can help my children learn about diversity and 
tolerance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Montgomery, who heads the Center for Media Education in  
Washington, said some parents believe their children are more 
expert than they are at using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often they're more familiar than parents are. We're struggling  
as parents to keep up with them,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``We're dealing with a very new medium in its  
earliest, formative stages, and we have an opportunity to help 
shape it. We don't have to be frightened, passive grownups worried 
about what it's going to do to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow said the study -- and others like it -- are important in  
gauging the future of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the threshold of a whole new cultural experience,''  
he said. ``This is not going to go away. This is going to become 
the fabric of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on a telephone poll of 1,102 parents in  
homes with at least one working computer and at least one child 
between the ages of 8 and 17. The interviews were conducted between 
Nov. 12 and Dec. 20 and carried a margin of error of plus or minus 
3 percentage points.

                            *Joe Adcock    	
</P>
<P>
	COUSHATTA, La. (AP) -- Joe Adcock, who broke up baseball's  
longest no-hitter and who shares the major league record of four 
homers in one game, died Monday at age 71. 
</P>
<P>
	The first baseman came to the majors in 1950 with Cincinnati,  
and was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 31, 1954, Adcock had the most productive game in  
history, hitting four homers and a double as the Braves beat the 
Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. At the time, he was the fifth 
player in the modern era to homer four times in a game. Five 
players have done so since. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock played on the Braves' World Series championship team in  
1957 and National League pennant winner in 1958. His best season 
was 1956, when he hit 38 of his 336 career homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock was perhaps best known for turning a perfect game into a  
loss for Pittsburgh's Harvey Haddix on May 26, 1959, at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix retired the first 36 batters he faced -- 12 perfect  
innings. In the 13th, Adcock homered with two players on base to 
end the no-hitter and win the game. The score was listed as 1-0 
because Adcock inadvertently passed Hank Aaron on the base paths. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Adcock moved to the Cleveland Indians and finished his  
playing career with the California Angels. He managed the Indians 
in 1967.

<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Steve Chiasson, a hockey player for the  
Carolina Hurricanes, died Monday when his truck flipped over, hours 
after his team was eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs. He was 
32. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who was not wearing a  
seat belt and had been driving alone, investigators said. The State 
Highway Patrol said he might have been speeding after drinking 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes' season  
with a 2-0 victory in Game 6. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the 
first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was traded to  
the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was the 
Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ernest Gross, a former State Department legal  
adviser and delegate to the United Nations, died Sunday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross, an international lawyer, was legal counsel to U.N.  
Assistant Secretary General Ralph Bunche and to U.N. Secretary 
General Dag Hammarskjold. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Gross helped introduce a convention against genocide to  
the United Nations. In the 1960s, while in private practice, he 
sued the South African government in the World Court because of its 
apartheid policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, Gross was instrumental in efforts to stymie the Soviet  
bid to transfer China's U.N. seat to the Communists, who had just 
won a civil war, from the Nationalists, who had just fled to 
Taiwan.

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Claudette Henry, who was state treasurer  
when a multimillion-dollar scandal rocked her office in the early 
1990s, died Sunday of scleroderma. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involved $6.7 million in overcharges and kickbacks  
on the trading of nearly $1.7 billion in U.S. securities. No 
charges were filed against Ms. Henry, who was defeated in the 1994 
Republican primary in a bid for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henry, a Republican from Oklahoma City, was elected to the  
Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1986. She was elected 
treasurer in 1990.

	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Meredith Morgan, who helped guide the  
University of California, Berkeley, optometry school through 67 of 
its 75 years, died of lung cancer Saturday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his research into basic mechanisms of eye focus and  
alignment, Morgan was a professor for 33 years and dean of the 
School of Optometry from 1960 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	His research into the elements of binocular vision resulted in  
two dozen papers laying out a basic understanding of how the two 
eyes work together to focus and converge on objects at close range. 
He also contributed to textbooks on the vision of children and the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan continued to be active with the university after his  
tenure and wrote the lead chapter in the recent book, ``Cal 
Optometry -- The First 75 Years.''

44-year career at The Tampa Tribune began as a $50-a-week assistant 
controller and ended as publisher in 1990, died Saturday at age 76. 
</P>
<P>
	As publisher, Pittman made it a point to know the full names of  
everyone who worked for him -- from the pressroom to the newsroom to 
the boardroom. His recognizable Southern greeting was: ``How you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman once said that the toughest call of his career was  
closing The Tampa Times, the city's afternoon newspaper owned by 
the Tribune Co. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- James H. Whittam, president and chief  
executive of Shaklee Companies, died of cancer April 15. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	A scientist and businessman, Whittam established Yamanouchi  
Shaklee Pharma, the pharmaceutical division of Shaklee Corp., to 
develop drug delivery systems. He has served as CEO of Shaklee for 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittam joined Shaklee in 1978, serving as manager of several  
research divisions and director of research until he left the 
company in 1984. He then worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble, overseeing the 
transition of Vidal Sassoon products into a separate division. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittam returned to San Francisco-based Shaklee in 1987 as  
senior vice president for research and development of new products. 
When the Japanese firm Yamanouchi acquired Shaklee, he was named 
president and CEO of the Shaklee Companies in 1989.

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After arresting a man accused of  
supplying a handgun to student killers Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, detectives kept up their search for those who may have 
known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a  
handgun to a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He admits giving the weapon. He was horrified,'' Manes'  
attorney, Robert Ransome, told The Denver Post in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be  
used for, but Ransome said his client knew nothing of the impending 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an eager  
but uneasy return to class at nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was  
released from jail after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance May  
10, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on 
charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and a shotgun -- 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still trying to find others who may have known the  
killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a 
third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good  
possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the 
school that day,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and 
the TEC DC-9 pistol. It was not immediately clear which gunman 
obtained the weapon or when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, 
traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes could face stiffer charges if authorities conclude he knew  
of the gunmen's plans at the time he allegedly supplied the gun, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the  
anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. 
Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application 
for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly 
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to 
treat depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Students from both high schools shared Chatfield's building in  
shifts Monday, with Chatfield students attending classes in the 
morning and Columbine students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend  
Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest 
of the year. The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis put the number of students affected at eight to 10, but  
said he did not know whether they were associated with the gunmen's 
clique known as the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators banned trench coats at every school in Jefferson  
County, which has 89,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Sales Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers can't seem to get enough new cars and  
trucks, pushing the auto industry's sales boom into its second 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major automakers that reported April sales results  
Monday, total sales were up 7.5 percent. Ford Motor Co., 
DaimlerChrysler AG and Japan's three biggest automakers each 
reported gains over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly year-to-year sales comparisons have been up through the  
past 13 months except in July and August, when total sales were 
artificially depressed as two strikes against General Motors Corp. 
restricted its supply. 
</P>
<P>
	GM remained the only major automaker to report its sales today.  
Analysts expected it to report flat to slightly lower sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring any surprises from GM ... it looks like another  
gangbuster month,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for April's improvement were familiar: a robust  
economy and consumers confident enough about the future to take on 
the increased debt of a new car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has the legs of a marathon runner,'' said Yale  
Gieszl, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``Consumers 
look at interest rates, inflation, Wall Street and the job market 
and have every reason to be confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its April sales were up 7 percent last month, compared  
with April 1998. Sales of light trucks set an April record -- the 
company's 12th straight monthly record for pickups, vans, minivans 
and sport utility vehicles combined. Car sales were up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include Ford's Volvo AB or Jaguar Cars units,  
each of which reported its U.S. sales rose 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said demand is so strong that it is again increasing its  
second-quarter production schedule, this time by 20,000 additional 
vehicles. With last month's 30,000 increase, Ford now plans to 
build just over 1.26 million cars and trucks during the April-June 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat unusual month at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler  
unit, in that its biggest improvement came in car sales. Total 
sales improved 2 percent; cars were up 6 percent while truck sales 
were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler unit sells more than twice as many light trucks as  
cars. But its minivan sales fell 19 percent just as the spring 
buying season was heating up, and pickup sales were flat. Healy 
said April's minivan performance was the ``hangover'' of 
incentive-driven sales in March that depleted inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said truck  
sales also suffered from a tough comparison to April 1998 when 
sales were boosted by a coupon war launched by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker posted an 18 percent gain in sales  
of highly profitable SUVs. In fact, SUV sales at the former 
Chrysler Corp. have set monthly records in 17 of the last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. posted its best April ever in the United  
States, with sales up nearly 10 percent. Its 7 percent rise in car 
sales was led once again by the Camry, the nation's bestseller, 
with sales up 21 percent for its best April ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Japanese automaker also was boosted by a 13.5  
percent rise in truck sales: the hot-selling Lexus RX300 SUV was up 
78 percent, while; the Sienna minivan had its best month ever with 
a 25 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. also benefited from improved truck sales, up 53  
percent. Overall sales improved 4 percent, dragged down by a 3 
percent decline in car sales. Honda's new Odyssey minivan posted a 
211 percent gain, while sales of the CR-V compact SUV improved 41 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Honda's top-seller, the Accord sedan, were flat while  
sales of the Civic subcompact were off 7 percent. But buyers 
flocked to the Acura TL luxury sedan, whose sales nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. had its biggest improvement in months: total  
sales were up 21 percent, led by a 26 percent gain in trucks. Its 
redesigned Quest minivan, for example, nearly doubled sales over 
April 1998. Car sales were up nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG said it has its best April in the United States in  
19 years, with sales up 29.5 percent on the strength of a new 
product lineup. Its redesigned Jetta sedan led the sales drive, 
with its best single month since the original version was 
introduced in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Belle Says It'll Take a Team To Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Don't blame Albert Belle for the Baltimore  
Orioles' woes. 
</P>
<P>
	His bat may not be living up to the $65 million contract he  
signed in the offseason, but it's early. And he's only one guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy is not able to turn an organization around. It takes  
all 25 players, the coaching staff, the management and the 
organization,'' said Belle, who is hitting .253. ``You can't just 
depend on one guy to do it. That's what I learned from '97. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``In that situation, I tried to do it all myself,'' he said.  
``It's just not going to work that way. ... April wasn't very good 
for a lot of us here. We've kind of dug ourselves a hole, and now 
we're trying to get out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle still isn't talking to Baltimore reporters because they  
wrote about a clubhouse temper tantrum in spring training. He spoke 
with the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune before 
Baltimore's first series with the Chicago White Sox, his old team. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's contract with the White Sox allowed him to ask for a  
raise or become a free agent if his average salary didn't remain 
among the top three in baseball. When the White Sox refused to give 
him a raise, Belle signed with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike when he left Cleveland in 1996, there's no animosity  
toward his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're entirely different situations,'' Belle said. ``I left  
Cleveland on bad terms, real bad. A lot of things happened and a 
lot of things were said that told me I could never go back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was different with the White Sox. When you only draw 1.3  
million fans and finish below .500, you know things have to change. 
That's just business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Belle would like to see his old team win the AL  
Central. Of course, that's partly because it would mean Cleveland 
wouldn't win it. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's biggest concern right now, however, is his own team.  
With the highest payroll in baseball ($84 million), the Orioles had 
high expectations at the beginning of the season. Instead, their 
7-17 record through Monday was the worst in the AL. They're already 
nine games behind New York in the AL East and have won just once on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	And Belle isn't doing much to help. Traditionally a slow  
starter, he was in an 8-for-46 slump through Monday with five 
homers. He's batting .200 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Belle usually heats up late -- he hit .387 with 31  
homers in the second half last year -- it might not be in time for 
the Orioles. Owner Peter Angelos is not likely to put up with the 
losing for long, and manager Ray Miller is already on shaky ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray's OK,'' Belle said. ``He's under tremendous pressure to  
win, especially with the high payroll, but we should be all right 
once we get over injuries and start to play like a team. There are 
a lot of new players here, like myself, but we're mostly veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we played a lot of Eastern Division teams  
first. It's the toughest division, but I think we can catch up to 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Co. To Purchase Wang Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Wang Global, the pioneering computer maker whose  
fortunes swung from industry powerhouse to bankruptcy, is being 
acquired by a Dutch computer services company Getronics NV for $2 
billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The union with Getronics will form the largest provider of  
networked technology services and business solutions in Europe, and 
one of the five largest in the world, company officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company is expected to have annual revenues of  
about $5 billion, with 33,000 employees and operations in more than 
44 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Getronics will purchase Wang for  
$29.25 a share, as well as warrants, options and other securities. 
Shares of Wang surged to $28.62 1/2, up $3.12 1/2 in early afternoon 
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang peaked in the mid 1980s when it manufactured word  
processors and closet-sized ``minicomputers,'' but it stumbled 
badly later in the decade when it failed to negotiate the computing 
world's transition to modern networked and desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1951 by An Wang, a Chinese immigrant  
who came to the United States to earn a Ph.D. at Harvard 
University. Then known as Wang Laboratories, the firm began with 
Wang's $600 in savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company went public in 1967 to finance its expansion in the  
calculator market, but sold that business in the mid-1970s to begin 
making word processors and minicomputers. Wang sales rose from $543 
million in 1980 to $2.4 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	But as personal computers became the workplace standard and the  
company began to slide, An Wang announced a host of new products -- 
many of which did not exist -- in an effort to stem the tide of 
customers switching to other technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost credibility with customers, and it lost $1.9  
billion from 1989 to 1992, when it declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	An Wang died from cancer of the esophagus in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	Wang emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993  
with chairman and CEO Joseph Tucci at the helm, and reinvented 
itself as a computer services provider, setting up, maintaining and 
helping companies run computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Billerica-based company, about 17 miles north of Boston, now  
has annualized revenues of $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics, based in Amsterdam, currently has no presence in the  
United States. It has about 11,000 employees and provides 
information and computer services in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics had $1.65 billion in revenue in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	News of the merger with Getronics came as Wang announced a net  
loss for the first quarter. The company posted a net loss of $57.7 
million, or $1.25 per share, on revenues of $789 million for the 
three months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Whitney, an analyst with Boston-based Advest Inc.,  
called the combination a good match. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice mix of services and there is not a lot of  
overlap,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney said he thought Getronics made a wise investment by  
acquiring Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Wang) reinvented themselves with a very good strategy  
focused on providing those services,'' Whitney said. ``I have them 
scheduled to turn a profit next quarter. I think they've turned the 
corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal is subject to regulatory and Wang shareholder  
approval.

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After arresting a man accused of  
supplying a handgun to student killers Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, detectives kept up their search for those who may have 
known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a  
handgun to a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He admits giving the weapon. He was horrified,'' Manes'  
attorney, Robert Ransome, told The Denver Post in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be  
used for, but Ransome said his client knew nothing of the impending 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an eager  
but uneasy return to class at nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cops Say Cuban Asks for Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Cuban sought asylum in the United States  
today, skipping the flight that returned baseball players home to 
Havana after their victory over the Baltimore Orioles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberto Herrera, a member of the Cuban delegation that was in  
Baltimore for Monday night's game, walked into a police station 
this morning and requested asylum, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police contacted the Immigration Naturalization Service, and the  
agency took custody of Herrera late this morning, police spokesman 
Robert Weinhold said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	What role Herrera played in the delegation and whether he was a  
player was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Cubans also may have asked for political asylum, said  
Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for Cuba's diplomatic  
mission in Washington, said six Cubans missed their flight because 
they overslept. He said he had no information on any defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said the six former baseball players were planning to  
catch another flight home either today or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they, overslept and missed their plane,'' he  
said, adding that they ``were very upset when they found out they 
missed their flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six men, whom he would not name, had attended the  
game and then went to an early morning reception before returning 
to their hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 Cubans were part of the delegation that attended  
Monday night's game, which the Cubans won 12-6. Besides players, 
the delegation included journalists, retired baseball players, 
ordinary citizens, members of youth groups and outstanding 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service would not comment on  
possible defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asylum is a very confidential process and I cannot confirm or  
deny that we are processing any members of the Cuban group,'' said 
Ben Ferro, regional director for the INS in Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Questions To Ask About Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some time when you want to challenge friends or  
a financial adviser to see how savvy they are about mutual-fund 
investing, try asking them these three simple questions: 
</P>
<P>
	Which types of long-term funds, investing in stocks or bonds or  
both, work best in ordinary taxable accounts? Which are better in 
tax-deferred retirement accounts? And why? 
</P>
<P>
	If the person you are questioning is truly knowledgeable, don't  
expect a fast, facile reply. These are very tough questions to 
answer correctly -- much tougher than anybody who follows the 
standard rules of thumb may realize. 
</P>
<P>
	``When planning for retirement, investors often face the dilemma  
of deciding which funds to hold in their taxable and tax-deferred 
accounts,'' notes Samuel Beardsley, a tax specialist at the fund 
management firm of T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom of putting stock funds in taxable  
accounts and bond funds in tax-deferred accounts may not be the 
best strategy for all investors,'' Beardsley says in a report just 
published at Price's site on the World Wide Web 
(www.troweprice.com). 
</P>
<P>
	The whole issue matters because the two basic types of  
investment accounts operate under entirely different tax systems. 
As Beardsley observes, ``Making the best choice can significantly 
affect long-term returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a standard taxable account, distributions based on dividends  
and interest, and short-term capital gains on investments held a 
year or less, are taxed by Uncle Sam at ordinary income rates which 
range as high as 39.6 percent, depending on your total income. But 
long-term capital gains, including the gains distributions many 
funds make each year, have a top rate of 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, investors in tax-deferred plans such as individual  
retirement accounts and employer-sponsored 401(k) plans pay no tax 
until they take money from the account, when all withdrawals are 
taxed as ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a greater percentage of the return from bond funds than  
from stock funds typically comes from dividends, it is often 
suggested that bond funds make more sense in tax-deferred accounts, 
and stock funds in taxable accounts. That is what Beardsley calls 
``the conventional method.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However,'' Beardsley says, ``in many cases, the taxes paid on  
the average stock fund's annual distributions exceed the taxes paid 
on the bond fund's distributions ... . Basically, because the stock 
fund earns so much more each year, and because that excess 
compounds, its tax bite is greater than the bond fund's and it pays 
to shelter the stock fund from tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Be advised, that general principle may not hold in every case.  
For instance, if we're talking about an index fund that makes few 
capital gains distributions, you are likely to be better off using 
the conventional method. 
</P>
<P>
	In many instances, the way things work out will depend on  
variables that can't be known in advance -- including the returns 
that will be earned over any future period by stock and bond funds. 
``Tax rates could change,'' Beardsley says. ``Another consideration 
is state taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the length of time you hold your investments can make a  
big difference. This is something you can plan for, although future 
events may cause you to change those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all this uncertainty, Beardsley offers a series of  
guidelines, summarized here only in part because of space 
constraints: 
</P>
<P>
	1. If you switch in and out of stock fund investments  
frequently, use the unconventional method. 
</P>
<P>
	2. If your stock fund is an index fund, use the conventional  
method. 
</P>
<P>
	3. If the tax-deferred account is a Roth IRA, use the  
unconventional method. 
</P>
<P>
	4. If you will liquidate your tax-deferred account in less than  
15 years, use the conventional method. 
</P>
<P>
	In practice, many individual fund investors don't bother with  
calculations like this. There are just too many unknowns involved. 
Besides, they may be dealing with limited choices anyway in a 
401(k) or similar retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's worth noting that a haphazard selection system may  
hurt the returns you realize over the years, by some amount that 
may never get measured.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Stock Jumps 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly minted shares of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.  
soared 36 percent in their first hours of trading this morning as 
investors welcomed Wall Street's elite investment bank into the 
public arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs ended its 130-year run as a private partnership  
today after selling 69 million shares in an initial public offering 
that raised $3.66 billion, the second-largest IPO in U.S. history 
after Conoco's $4 billion stock sale late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand was so strong that Goldman's shares jumped as high as $72  
after selling for $53 in Monday's offering. More than 12 million 
shares changed hands by late morning, making Goldman the most 
active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone walks out happy,'' said Randall Roth, an analyst at  
Renaissance Capital Corp., which runs the IPO Plus Aftermarket 
Fund. ``Portfolio managers know they didn't buy it at an outrageous 
price, and Goldman because they know they got a good price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Requests for shares, which were priced near the top end of the  
expected range of $45 to $55 a share, totaled more than 10 times 
the amount Goldman had offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew it was going to be big,'' Roth said. ``This is a  
stock you're going to sock away in your portfolio rather than day 
trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman first tried to go public last fall after years of  
resistance among its partners. But the effort was shelved as 
financial markets were roiled by economic turmoil overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared to have no such concerns Monday as the Dow  
Jones industrial average soared 225.65 points to close at 
11,014.69, its first finish above the 11,000 benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman is among Wall Street's leaders in launching corporate  
sales of stocks and bonds and assisting companies in mergers and 
acquisitions. While it is not known as a brokerage serving average 
investors, the firm has invested in developing online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, which will trade under the symbol GS, sold shares to  
raise the cash it needs to expand operations around the world and 
remain competitive. Goldman also plans to borrow $16 billion 
through the sale of notes, according to documents filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the mantle of a public company, goes a level of  
scrutiny and responsibility to shareholders. Goldman Sachs, long a 
secretive and elite partnership, will now face public disclosure of 
its dealings, executive pay and policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the potential shareholders are activists like Blaine  
Townsend, a ``social analyst'' with Trillium Asset Management, a 
Boston-based money management company formerly known as Franklin 
Research and Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to understand what the social impact of their deals  
is on the planet as a whole,'' said Townsend, who owns shares of 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and J.P. Morgan. ``The time is past 
where they can embrace philanthropy as a proxy for morality.''

<HEADLINE> Factory Owner's Assets Unfrozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a lawsuit, the Clinton  
administration is unfreezing the assets of Saudi businessman Saleh 
Idris even though it still believes he may be involved in 
international terrorism, the Justice and Treasury departments say. 
</P>
<P>
	The government agreed to release more than $24 million in Bank  
of America deposits on Monday, the day it was scheduled to answer a 
civil suit Idris filed Feb. 26 over the U.S. bombing of a 
pharmaceutical plant he owned in Khartoum, Sudan. The suit claimed 
the government was blocking his use of the money even though it had 
no evidence the factory was producing chemical weapons agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen cruise missiles struck the El Shifa plant in Khartoum  
on Aug. 20, 1998. It was one of several properties destroyed after 
bombings earlier that month at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania 
killed a total of 301 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said the government lifted the  
freeze after deciding it was unwise to reveal the sources of their 
evidence during a trial in open court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a judgment that we had concerns regarding Mr. Idris  
based on sensitive information, but we're not prepared to 
compromise those sources for the sake of this case,'' said an 
administration official who spoke on condition of not being 
identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concerns about Mr. Idris and his business dealings,''  
the senior official said. ``There are things that Mr. Idris has 
associated himself with that I think that every American would find 
reprehensible. ... And we will continue to monitor his network for 
any potential threat to U.S. interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Idris' attorneys said he believed the government backed  
down because it had no evidence the plant was involved in chemical 
weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, we live in a country where we have a system of  
justice that requires that people produce evidence when someone is 
accused of being a terrorist,'' attorney George Salem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salem also said that studies, including examinations of the soil  
at the plant, performed by independent consultants at Idris' 
request found no trace of substances used in chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Salem said Idris planned to drop the suit -- as well as another  
one filed against the Bank of America -- with the full and 
unconditional release of his bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the bombing, U.S. officials said the  
pharmaceutical plant was a cover for chemical weapons production. 
They also said it had links to suspected terrorist mastermind Osama 
bin Laden, who allegedly bankrolled the bombings of the American 
embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward, the Sudanese government called the bombing a  
blunder and insisted the facility produced medicines and other 
goods needed by the country's citizens.

<HEADLINE> Speed, Alcohol Blamed in NHL Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Teammates and family members of Carolina  
Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson remembered him Tuesday as 
having a ``zest for life'' and a determination on the ice that 
produced a solid 13-year NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, 32, was killed early Monday when his pickup truck went  
out of control and rolled. Chiasson, who wasn't wearing a seat 
belt, was thrown from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	A hour-long private memorial service was held for Chiasson at  
St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, just minutes from where he was 
killed. His funeral will be Saturday in his native Peterborough, 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	``This still doesn't seem real,'' goaltender Trevor Kidd said  
after the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Hurricanes entered the church holding hands with  
their wives or girlfriends as a large photo of Chiasson in his 
uniform rested on an easel to the right of the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	The team and the rest of the organization was joined by NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman and director of hockey operations Colin 
Campbell, former coach of the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson's wife, Susan, and the couple's children, ages 7, 4 and  
2, followed the team, holding roses. When 2-year-old Stephanie 
approached the alter and saw the photo, she shouted, ``There's my 
daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an emotional afternoon for the team, which learned of  
Chiasson's death less than 12 hours after being eliminated from the 
Stanley Cup playoffs by Boston on Sunday night. Former Carolina 
player Stu Grimson sent words of prayer. Nelson Emerson, traded to 
Ottawa in midseason, flew in for the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players stared straight ahead while others cried.  
Chiasson's best friend, Ray Sheppard, buried his head on his wife's 
shoulder as Susan Chiasson addressed the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can just feel him here,'' Susan Chiasson said. ``He wasn't a  
hockey player, he was my best friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived life,'' she added. ``All of you go home and hug your  
significant other and kiss your children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Dineen, the team's captain last year, spoke for about 10  
minutes, as did Sheppard, who had a tough time holding it together. 
Sheppard, who roomed with Chiasson on the road, talked of his 
friend's honestly and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take that with me for as long as I live,'' Sheppard said.  
``He'll be in our prayers forever. We should all be grateful for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Dineen talked to Chiasson's children, telling them of  
their father's leadership skills and enjoyment of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dad spoke when he felt he had something to offer. He  
didn't speak just to be heard,'' Dineen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson was traveling at about 74 mph in a 55-mph zone,  
according to the accident report released Tuesday. Highway Patrol 
Trooper K.L. Horne said he was awaiting results of a blood test 
before commenting on whether alcohol played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne said results of a blood-alcohol test will not be available  
for two to three weeks, but the report issued listed intoxication 
as an accident factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Chris Brown said Tuesday night that Chiasson and  
about half of the players attended a party at the home of teammate 
Gary Roberts after the team plane arrived at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the three hours that transgressed there,'' Brown said,  
referring to the time lapse when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck came almost two years after an automobile accident  
involving Chiasson's former Detroit Red Wings teammate Vladimir 
Konstantinov, Detroit's Vyacheslav Fetisov and the team masseur. 
The three were injured in June 1997 after a celebration of the Red 
Wings' first Stanley Cup in 42 years, won six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov received severe head injuries that ended his  
career, and the masseur, Sergei Mnatsakanov, also was seriously 
injured. Fetisov had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Red Wings before being  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and then, in 1997, to the 
Hartford Whalers, who later became the Hurricanes. He played in his 
first NHL All-Star game in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson had shoulder surgery in January and played in only 28  
regular season games, scoring once and adding eight assists. The 
operation was expected to end his season, but he returned to play 
all six playoff games for the Hurricanes, scoring a goal and two 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a real satisfaction in knowing that he did everything  
he could to get back and help his teammates,'' Dineen said.

	Storms Deadliest in 15 Years  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The pack of tornadoes that tore through the  
Midwest left at least 45 people dead, making them the deadliest 
storms in nearly 15 years. The death toll is the highest for a 
weather-related disaster since 1985, when storms killed 90 people 
in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario. And Oklahoma authorities say the 
death toll is expected to rise because destruction is just ``so 
massive.'' The National Weather Service says the biggest twister 
formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Entire 
neighborhoods were wiped out, officials said. Mobile homes were 
tossed around like tin cans. President Clinton has declared 11 
counties in Oklahoma disaster areas, a move that will provide 
federal funding.

	NATO Claims Heavy Hits in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO claimed today its most  
successful round of attacks yet against Serb forces and shot down a 
Yugoslav plane in the first air-to-air battle since early in the 
six-week-old campaign. An alliance jet downed a Yugoslav MiG-29 
fighter jet in a dogfight over Serbia. The Serbs have avoided air 
confrontations since early in the conflict, which began March 24. 
British defense officials said more than 50 targets were struck 
over the previous 24 hours in relentless attacks focusing on 
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.

ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. More than 2,000 refugees had crossed 
the border by midafternoon, many repeating similar stories of 
forces demanding money from ethnic Albanian refugees, and gunning 
down those who didn't comply. Officials say more than 250,000 
refugees have headed south from Kukes, but more than 100,000 remain 
in the Kukes area and do not want to leave.

gun laws, has been re-elected to another term as president of the 
National Rifle Association. Demonstrators gathered to protest the 
NRA's meeting so soon after the massacre at Columbine High, where 
two teen-aged gunmen killed 12 classmates and a teacher. ``The 
problem is not the availability of arms,'' Heston said shortly 
after the shootings, ``but the government's poor record in 
prosecuting both juveniles and adults for gun violations.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Meeting Fails To Appoint Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization broke off attempts  
Tuesday to find a new director-general after virtually ruling out 
Thailand's candidate and failing to agree on his New Zealand rival. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of the 134-nation WTO General Council adjourned after  
its chairman, Ali Mchumo, was unable to rally Asian and developing 
countries around former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, the 
American and European choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock increased the likelihood that a third candidate may  
need to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	It also raised the prospect of a lengthy leadership vacuum which  
may damage efforts to mediate high-profile trade disputes and 
prepare for a November summit in Seattle to lower barriers to 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Renato Ruggiero officially left Friday after four years  
in the post, but stayed at work until Tuesday afternoon. In a final 
statement, he expressed disappointment that no successor had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo, a Tanzanian diplomat told the council that there was no  
prospect of consensus to appoint Supachai Panitchpakdi, the Thai 
deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll last week, 62 countries supported Moore, a former  
trade unionist who was prime minister briefly in 1990. Supachai, 
the front-runner for months and the perceived developing country 
candidate, was backed by 59 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the case that Dr. Supachai and his supporters may  
still believe he is a candidate,'' Mchumo said. ``But in terms of 
the rules of this process he is no longer a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Asian nations stood by their choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any attempt to impose a decision on the WTO membership could  
divide us and as a consequence gravely impair ... the entire 
organization,'' said a statement by Malaysia on behalf of the ASEAN 
group of countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for reflection and responsibility by all as the means  
to restore unity,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies in Latin America and parts of  
Europe insist that the title of director-general now belongs to 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while to form a consensus,'' U.S. delegate Rita  
Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has named David Hartridge, head of its services  
division, as acting director, but only to handle routine matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartridge lacks the international clout needed at a time when  
free trade ideals are under pressure from the global economic 
upheavals.

<HEADLINE>  Tornadoes Kill Dozens in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The death toll stood at 36 today after  
fierce tornadoes destroyed entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and 
Kansas. One monstrous twister chewed across miles of Tornado Alley 
for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner said 31 people were killed in  
Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms. The number of 40 deaths the 
office had given out earlier in the day was only an estimate, 
spokesman Ray Blakeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined Oklahoma-Kansas death toll makes this the deadliest  
tornado outbreak since 42 people were killed last year in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest twister formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma  
City and cut a path at least a half-mile wide. While many tornadoes 
are short-lived, this one stayed on the ground for about four 
hours, said Wayne Ruff, a National Weather Service meteorologist. 
Local TV stations followed it with live broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage ``looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine  
stories tall, it's spread out over a large area,'' Oklahoma City 
assistant fire chief Jon Hansen said, referring to the federal 
building bombing in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More severe thunderstorms with scattered twisters rippled across  
the Plains this morning, and tornado warnings were posted for parts 
of central Oklahoma. A tornado watch covered much of the rest of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton declared 11 Oklahoma counties  
disaster areas and promised a similar declaration for parts of 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 miles north of Oklahoma City, a tornado spawned by the  
same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses 
and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kan., and its suburb of 
Haysville. Hospitals treated more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see,'' said Bob Thompson, a fire  
battalion chief in Sedgwick County, Kan. He said more deaths were 
possible, and dogs were used today to search the rubble of homes in 
Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in  
Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his 
companions were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris said. ``We all rolled in it. It  
was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the dead included 11 people in Bridge Creek, about  
30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman 
for the state Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Others died in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore, Del  
City and Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really just getting started on the foot-by-foot  
search,'' Clayton Taylor, a Red Cross spokesman, said today in 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have whole communities that simply aren't there anymore,''  
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told NBC's ``Today'' show. ``It 
certainly looks like a huge battle has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of houses destroyed in the Oklahoma City area  
approached 2,000. Cars were tossed about and crushed. Natural gas 
spewed from ruptured lines. Utility poles were splintered into 
kindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in the Oklahoma City metro area treated 563 people for  
tornado-related injuries, police Capt. Charles Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the war in Germany. I've had bombs fall all  
around me. Now I've been in a tornado,'' 73-year-old Anna Knerr 
said today in a shelter in Midwest City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Knerr said she and her husband hid in a closet before the  
storm hit. ``Then there just was this creepy feeling,'' she said. 
``The next thing I know I was covered. The roof just collapsed on 
me.'' She and her husband crawled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman said the tornado  
may have been a mile wide at times. The weather service's David 
Andra predicted the twister would be categorized at least an F4, 
the second-strongest tornado classification, defined as a storm 
with wind at 207 to 260 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It would probably be late today before the staff at the  
laboratory could determine just how strong the tornado was, 
researcher Harold Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system also spawned twisters in north and west Texas, but  
did no major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
	The main tornado in Oklahoma formed near Chickasha, about 45  
miles southwest of the capital. It plowed across the flat 
countryside, toppling trees, power lines, buildings and cars until 
it ripped into south Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service issued its first tornado warning at  
4:49 p.m. Monday as twisters started over rural parts of the state. 
Television stations started live coverage a few minutes later, 
following the storms with cameras and radar for about two hours 
before the tornadoes slammed into the Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, tornadoes killed 42 people around Kissimmee, Fla., on  
Feb. 22-23, and 34 people died in the area of Birmingham, Ala., on 
April 8.

<HEADLINE> Company Conference Calls Go Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investor conference calls, once reserved for  
financial analysts and investment bankers, are moving to the 
Internet, where they'll be available to online investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of technology companies will carry the conference calls  
of publicly traded companies live and offer the ability to send 
questions by e-mail during the call. 
</P>
<P>
	CCBN.com, a Boston-based provider of investor relations Web site  
services, and INTERVU Inc., a San Diego-based company that delivers 
audio and video over the Internet, today established an alliance 
that will put the calls online. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, INTERVU's streaming media services will be  
used in CCBN.com's WebCast service, the companies said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	CCBN.com's WebCast will also provide clients with the ability to  
post a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for review during the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Petroleum Co. used WebCast to broadcast its quarterly  
conference call on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Edd Grigsby, vice president of Investor and Public Relations at  
Phillips Petroleum, said Internet carriage helps ``level the 
playing field'' for individual and institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference calls have been used as a tool for public companies  
to deliver comprehensive insight and timely information to 
analysts, investment bankers and major institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, has continued  
to scrutinize conference calls as a potential area for selective 
disclosure by public companies.

<HEADLINE> MediaOne Calls Off Comcast Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T. Microsoft. America Online. And now  
apparently MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	All have been linked to the bidding war for MediaOne Group Inc.  
in what is shaping to be the highest-profile battle on Wall Street 
since the fight for control of RJR Nabisco and could lead to a 
showdown between two of the nation's top telecommunications 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The war started when AT&AMP;T Corp. issued a surprise bid for  
MediaOne on April 22, ultimately derailing Comcast Inc.'s $48 
billion agreement to acquire the fourth-largest U.S. cable company. 
MediaOne said Monday it was choosing AT&AMP;T's cash and stock deal, 
now worth nearly $56 billion, but also said Comcast had until 
Thursday to make another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent Comcast, the nation's No. 3 cable company, scrambling  
to find help. Enter Microsoft Corp. and America Online Inc., who 
both signed confidentiality agreements to examine MediaOne's secret 
internal financial data last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous sources reported Monday that America Online had bowed  
out of the bidding war, though AOL declined to comment. Microsoft, 
meanwhile, hasn't said anything publicly about its intentions, and 
Comcast also refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a new suitor has reportedly jumped into the game. The  
New York Times reported today that MCI WorldCom Inc. is seriously 
considering jumping into the fray to aid Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom was talking to MediaOne Monday night about signing  
the same kind of agreement to examine the cable company's, the 
Times said, citing executives close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	If MCI WorldCom does join the bidding war, America Online may be  
interested in being a third-party partner to the bid, the 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both MCI WorldCom and MediaOne declined comment  
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite fears that AT&AMP;T will dominate the potential online and  
telephone riches to be mined from cable TV wires, analysts have not 
been optimistic that a competing offer would emerge. For one thing, 
Microsoft and AOL simply may not want to become cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (Comcast's) partners want to be as deeply into  
cable as some people are assuming they do,'' said Tom Vanderslice, 
managing director for media corporate finance at CIBC Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, however, has already committed itself to the cable  
business though its purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., the 
nation's second biggest system, and an alliance with Time Warner, 
the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and AOL don't have the same incentive. If the goal of  
buying MediaOne is to use cable TV wires for high-speed Internet 
access and phone calls, what good does it do to own the nation's 
fourth largest cable company if it means alienating AT&AMP;T, which 
already has access to the two biggest? 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T needs MediaOne more than Comcast does and more than  
Microsoft does,'' Thomas Eagan, a cable industry analyst for 
PaineWebber Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If AT&AMP;T wins, the No. 1 long-distance company will also be the  
No. 1 cable company, having access to 60 percent of the U.S. homes 
wired for cable.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man who has admitted  
selling a semiautomatic handgun to the two Columbine student gunmen 
had gone shooting in the woods with the two before the school 
massacre, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, a computer programmer, fired weapons with Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold three times within the month prior to the 
rampage that left 15 dead, said attorney Robert Ransome. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes thought he was just spending time with fellows who just  
enjoyed shooting, and ``did not know this was going to happen,'' 
Ransome said. ``Mark's family is extremely devastated about what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they do not know if Manes was aware of what the  
gun would be used for. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a handgun to  
a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in prison. Ransome 
said his client was talking to prosecutors and hoped to avoid a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said his client bought the pistol at a gun show last  
fall. He later met Harris and Klebold through a mutual 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the attorney said. ``Mark was not friends with Eric and Dylan. He 
did not hang out with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not give specifics on where they went out shooting,  
whether Manes sold ammunition to the pair, the sale price of the 
gun, what his client may have known about the law involving sales 
to minor, or who else might have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, detectives kept up their search for those who may  
have known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an  
eager but uneasy return to class Monday at nearby Chatfield High 
School. Chatfield students had class in the morning, Columbine 
students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend  
Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest 
of the year. The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was  
released from jail after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance next  
Monday, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on 
charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and 
a shotgun -- and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado 
law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with 
rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still trying to find others who may have known the  
killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a 
third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good  
possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the 
school that day,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and 
the TEC DC-9 pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the  
anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. 
Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application 
for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly 
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to 
treat depression.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Unfamiliar Turf for Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When the playoffs begin this weekend, the Miami  
Heat and Indiana Pacers will be chasing the Eastern Conference 
title while the Chicago Bulls sit home counting lottery picks. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the Bulls hadn't demolished their team after Michael  
Jordan retired? 
</P>
<P>
	What if they'd thrown a whole bunch of money at Scottie Pippen,  
Luc Longley, Steve Kerr and the rest of the gang and persuaded them 
to stay for one last go-around? Could Chicago have won the East 
and, possibly, a seventh title? 
</P>
<P>
	Depends who's asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would have been right there,'' said former Bull Jud  
Buechler, now with the Detroit Pistons. ``It seems like there's not 
really one team that's really dominating. If we would have brought 
everyone back, who knows? If there weren't any injuries to our 
team, I think we could have been in the mix for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the mix, maybe. But win it all? No way, general manager Jerry  
Krause said. Not without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was such a big part in the locker room. He made  
everyone around him better, and filling that hole would have been 
near impossible,'' Krause said. ``We thought we could win a bunch 
of games, but winning a championship, we did not think we had the 
ability to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Jordan retired, the Bulls were showing signs the  
reign was coming to an end. They barely got by Indiana in last 
year's Eastern Conference finals. Not even ``Judge Judy'' could 
have reconciled coach Phil Jackson and Krause. Dennis Rodman was 
getting weirder -- and that's tough to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were getting older, too, with Longley the only starter  
under 30. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Jordan hung up his sneakers in January, the Bulls  
decided it was best to gut the team and start over. The first to go 
was Pippen, who -- feeling underappreciated and underpaid -- was 
looking to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to come out west, so I don't know what would  
have happened,'' said Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
deal with the Rockets. ``I was looking to move on, and that's what 
I did. Whether or not we could have stayed together as a team and 
been successful is difficult to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not like anyone else is lighting up the league, though.  
Indiana, anointed the favorite before the lockout even ended, has 
struggled. Miami lost to the Bulls over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other coast, the Utah Jazz are vulnerable, the Rockets  
have yet to live up to their hype and the Los Angeles Lakers need 
therapy more than a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys had been there,'' said Frank Hamblen, a Bulls  
assistant under Jackson and now Tim Floyd. ``Plus, Michael, as 
great as he is, we still had a lot of good players left who knew 
the system, played together and been champions together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have been hard, but I still think we would  
have been right there as far as in the East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Bulls are 13-36 with one game left, the third-worst  
record in the NBA. Even with a victory Wednesday, they're 
guaranteed to finish with the worst winning percentage in franchise 
history. They've set or tied all kinds of lowlights, including the 
NBA's record for fewest points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But as bad as this season is, Krause said re-signing everyone  
would have doomed Chicago for years. Pippen, Longley and Kerr 
signed five-year deals worth a total of $118 million, meaning the 
Bulls would have had little, if any, salary-cap room the next few 
years. Now Chicago has oodles of cap room and a bunch of extra 
draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have been capped with the oldest team in the league  
and no way to get younger,'' Krause said. ``And one of the worst 
things I think you can do is come fairly close and be old and 
capped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in the end, do the what-ifs really matter? What's done is  
done, said Ron Harper, the only starter left in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look around and sit back and say, 'I'd hoped we had  
our same team here,''' he said. ``If we would have kept half our 
team here, I think we would have been there. But it didn't happen, 
so life goes on.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson &AMP; Johnson Wants Centocor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson is in talks to buy  
Centocor Inc. for more than $3 billion in stock in a deal that 
would give J&AMP;J access to a new, hot-selling heart drug, according 
to people familiar with the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the negotiations are in an early stage and could still  
fall apart, J&AMP;J and Centocor could reach an agreement within a 
week, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Both companies declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor makes ReoPro, a popular drug used to prevent blood  
clotting that had sales of $365 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that Johnson &AMP; Johnson may want to acquire the drug  
maker to help revive weakening sales of its cardiovascular stents, 
the tiny devices that hold arteries open. In addition to drugs, 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson also makes many consumer products such as 
Band-Aids, Tylenol and baby shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Johnson &AMP; Johnson could bundle their stents with ReoPro for  
the cardiovascular community and differentiate their product line 
up,'' said Ann Pluemer Barber, an analyst at Credit Suisse First 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the latest big consolidation in an industry  
driven by the quest for new products. In January, Warner-Lambert 
Co. announced a $2.1 billion acquisition of Agouron 
Pharmaceuticals, which makes the AIDS drug Viracept. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big drug companies need more products in their pipelines to  
drive growth,'' Barber said. ``If you get a couple new products out 
you can really drive profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor's stock, which has been climbing on takeover rumors,  
rose another $2.25 or 4.8 percent to $49.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market Tuesday, giving the Malvern, Pa. company a market value of 
$3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's stock fell $2.75 to $95 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Investors may be worried about the dilution to J&AMP;J's earnings if it 
issues stock to pay for Centocor. They also may be concerned that 
Centocor's agreement with Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. to co-market ReoPro makes 
Centocor a less attractive target. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, J&AMP;J could do a lot to help expand Centocor's  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the financial and organizational resources  
Johnson &AMP; Johnson can bring to bear on the ongoing development of 
Centocor, it would be an exciting opportunity,'' said Richard 
Stover, an analyst with Arnold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's marketing muscle could also boost sales of Centocor's drug  
Remicade, which treats Crohn's disease, which is currently under 
governmental review for treating rheumatoid arthritis.

<HEADLINE> Auto Insurance Rates Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Auto insurance rates fell 2.8 percent last year  
nationwide -- the first decline in 25 years -- and could fall further 
this year, an industry group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Information Institute said the drop reflected  
greater competition among insurers, more skilled drivers on the 
road, safer vehicles and less tolerance for drunken drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based institute said it expected an additional drop  
of about 4.5 percent this year, adding that ``motorists with good 
driving records may see even bigger savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline in rates, auto insurance spending rose  
slightly in 1998, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the New York-based  
institute, said the average amount spent on auto insurance 
increased 0.5 percent last year largely because of record new car 
sales, which drove up the price of vehicles being insured. 
</P>
<P>
	``New cars are more expensive than old ones, and so is the  
insurance,'' he said. Hartwig added that a larger proportion of new 
vehicles being sold are expensive sports utility vehicles and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he predicts expenditures to fall by about 1 percent  
because ``the rate decline should be larger (this year) than in 
1998, and new car prices are falling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute predicted consumers would spend, on average, about  
$702 in auto insurance this year, down from $709 in 1998. The 
average expenditure was $706 in 1997, it said. It based its 
averages on figures from the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig noted that the last time insurance rates declined was in  
1973, when the economy was in recession. To see a decline now, amid 
economic growth, indicates ``that the insurance industry is among 
those that are almost deflationary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that about half of the 2.8 percent drop in rates this  
year was attributable to increased competition in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Car Hits Schoolyard; 2 Toddlers Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who told police he wanted to  
``execute'' innocent children plowed through a day care center 
playground with his car, killing two toddlers and injuring five 
people, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	When the big Cadillac finally came to a stop, pinning several  
children underneath, he calmly sat behind the wheel until police 
arrested him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why he picked yesterday, why he picked this school, why he  
picked these kids, we don't know,'' Lt. Ron Smith said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Allen Abrams, 39, of Santa Ana was arrested for  
investigation of murder and assault with a deadly weapon after 
driving his car into the Southcoast Early Childhood Learning Center 
schoolyard. He was held without bail pending his arraignment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to execute these children because they were  
innocent,'' Abrams told detectives, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams didn't know anyone in the school but was familiar with  
the neighborhood, where he lived five years ago before a split with 
his girlfriend, Smith said. He was eventually convicted of stalking 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his mind he associated the school with the neighborhood he  
used to live in,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Soto, 4, and Brandon Wiener, 3, were killed. Nicholas  
McHardy, 2, and Victoria Sherman, 5, were in critical condition 
with head injuries. Danielle Knecht, a 24-year-old teacher's aide, 
was in fair condition with a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other children, ages 2 and 3, were treated for scrapes and  
bruises and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a cop for 20 years and I have never seen anything  
where someone deliberately drove a car into a playground and killed 
children. It's unfathomable to me,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams worked at a concert ticket agency that was owned by his  
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the schoolyard killings, he rammed his  
car into another vehicle that cut him off on a freeway, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the day care center, an angry crowd of neighbors, parents and  
workers from a nearby church jeered as he was led away in 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign Abrams was under the influence of drugs or  
alcohol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the school was closed indefinitely Tuesday, and a  
memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday night at the church 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	A shrine formed at the school -- a mount of bouquets, balloons,  
stuffed animals and cards. A cross erected in the playground read, 
``Dear God, please protect our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A man who would do something like this doesn't deserve to  
live,'' said Ann Pecora, fighting back tears as gripped the hand of 
her 4-year-old daughter, Gina, who was one of the lucky toddlers 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Boat Accident Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The driver of a Lake Hamilton tour boat  
that went to the bottom in seconds, killing 13 people, said the 
vessel's pump failed to kick in when water poured through the hull, 
a federal investigator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pump has become a focus of the investigation as a Navy  
salvage crew began preparations to raise the amphibious craft from 
the lake bed where it settled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In talking with investigators on Sunday, the day after the  
accident, driver Elizabeth Helmbrecht said she did not hear the 
main pump activate, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman 
John A. Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she did not hear the larger pump begin pumping the water,  
then she had no real warning'' that the amphibious craft was taking 
on water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hammerschmidt said Helmbrecht may not have heard the pump.  
Ms. Helmbrecht told investigators she scuttled a trip several days 
before the fatal outing when she heard the bilge pump turn on. 
</P>
<P>
	The pump is supposed to turn on if water about four inches deep  
reaches the center of the hull, Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammerschmidt said it was not immediately clear whether  
mechanics had worked on the pump when it was taken in for repairs 
prior to the sinking.

<HEADLINE> Dioxin Exposure Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer mortality increased by 60 percent for  
chemical workers who were exposed to high levels of dioxin, but 
levels of the chemical typically found in the environment appear to 
present no increased cancer risk, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In research published today in the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute, an analysis of the health records of workers 
exposed to various levels of dioxin showed that only those at the 
highest exposures had statistically significant increases in cancer 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Steenland, co-author of the study, said the research  
suggests most people typically are not currently exposed to 
dangerous levels of dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a significant increase in cancers until you get  
to the upper'' exposure levels, Steenland said Tuesday in a 
telephone interview. ``This is not raising a red flag by saying 
that low level exposure is causing a lot of cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the finding ``reassuring'' from a public health  
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland, a researcher with the National Institute for  
Occupational Safety and Health, said that the amount of dioxin in 
the environment is steadily declining because the products most 
commonly linked to the chemical are no longer being made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin was a byproduct in the manufacture of herbicides and  
pesticides that were in common use decades ago. Production of the 
chemicals halted in the mid 1980s, and the environmental 
contamination has dropped steadily since. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for those who experienced high exposures, the chemical  
can persist in the body for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is one of the chemicals in Agent Orange, the herbicide  
used by the United States to kill jungle vegetation during the 
Vietnam War. Hundreds of American troops were exposed to the 
chemical, but not at the high levels experienced by many chemical 
plant workers, said Steenland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert N. Hoover, of the National Cancer Institute, said  
that the study by Steenland and his colleagues is ``a critical 
piece of evidence'' that shows dioxin, at its present levels in the 
environment, appears to present no significant threat to general 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news from this study is the evidence that dioxin at  
high exposures is a'' cancer-causing chemical, said Hoover. ``The 
good news is that the low levels of exposure (now in the 
environment) are not likely to contribute much disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Steenland examined the health record of some 3,500  
chemical workers who were exposed to dioxin on the job during the 
1960s, '70s and '80s for periods of six months to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among workers with the highest exposure rate there was a 60  
percent increase in cancer deaths when compared to the rate of 
cancer deaths among the general public. This increase, said 
Steenland, was seen only in those workers whose dioxin exposure was 
100 to 1,000 times higher than the background exposure of the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said that dioxin seemed to cause all types of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	``The cancer elevation is not in some specific organ,'' he said.  
``We saw it in respiratory tract cancers and in digestive tract 
cancer. It was across the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said the public health threat of dioxin is declining  
because nobody is regularly exposed to the high levels that once 
were common among chemical plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dioxin is not being added to the environment at anywhere near  
the rate it once was,'' he said. ``It is still produced by 
incinerators when they burn plastics, but it is becoming less and 
less.''

<HEADLINE> Willey Says Clinton Made Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Kathleen Willey testified in court  
Tuesday that she confided to her friend, Julie Hiatt Steele, about 
President Clinton's ``very forceful'' sexual advance in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a new disclosure, Mrs. Willey said she was so upset by  
the events of that day in 1993, the same day her husband committed 
suicide, that Ms. Steele had to remind her later of their 
conversation on the alleged sexual advance by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a crucial point in the obstruction trial of Ms. Steele, who  
is charged with lying to Kenneth Starr's investigators when she 
denied that Mrs. Willey had told her about the incident hours after 
it allegedly happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele says Mrs. Willey first told her about the experience  
with Clinton in 1997, asking her to lie about it to a Newsweek 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, a friend who worked with her in the White House  
social office testified that Mrs. Willey confided Clinton's alleged 
sexual advance to her shortly after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	In a barely audible voice, Ruthie Eisen said that, according to  
Mrs. Willey's account, the president ``kissed her and hugged her'' 
and ``touched her chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that the president had gotten aroused and said he had  
wanted to do that for a long time or wanted to do that since he saw 
her,'' Ms. Eisen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eisen said Mrs. Willey told her she was ``caught offguard''  
by the president's advance. Ms. Eisen said she assumed Mrs. Willey 
revealed the incident in confidence. Ms. Eisen said she didn't tell 
anyone about it until she was questioned by Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Mrs. Willey ever asked her to lie or fabricate  
anything, Ms. Eisen replied, ``absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Tripp is the only other White House staffer to have said  
that Mrs. Willey confided the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
	In her testimony on the trial's second day, Mrs. Willey said she  
relayed the account of the advance after coming to Ms. Steele's 
house outside Richmond, Va. Immediately before visiting Ms. Steele, 
Mrs. Willey said she had been frantically looking for her husband, 
whose body was found the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recall being there (at the house) because Julie told me I  
was there,'' Mrs. Willey testified. ``She reminded me that I was 
there, that I had told her briefly what happened with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied under oath making any such advance on Mrs.  
Willey. Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's 
office, said there would be no comment Tuesday on Willey's 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the witness stand on the trial's second day, Mrs. Willey  
recounted her meeting with the president in the Oval Office. A 
White House volunteer, she had come to ask Clinton for a paying job 
to help relieve her family's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him we were having a crisis,'' Mrs. Willey said, and  
that she was desperate for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	As they talked, he led her to a small galley kitchen adjacent to  
the Oval Office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Clinton ``hugged me and told me he was very sorry.''  
Then Clinton began to kiss her. ``He was very forceful. His hands 
were all over me,'' Mrs. Willey testified. She said he touched her 
breasts and put his hands up her dress. ``I told him I needed to 
get out of there,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Did she try to resist? a prosecutor asked. ``Yes,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of her husband's suicide, Ms. Steele took her  
to the hospital because she was so emotionally upset, Mrs. Willey 
testified.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Sues Baseball Over Termination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN's 10th season of baseball could be its last  
because of a conflict with NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN sued major league baseball in federal court Tuesday to try  
to prevent termination of the network's regular-season contract, 
which has three years to run. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight season, baseball is refusing to allow  
the network to switch three September Sunday night games to ESPN2 
and run NFL games on the bigger-audience ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball has attempted to extort hundreds of million of  
dollars of economic concessions as the `price' for its consent,'' 
ESPN said in a 30-page complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Beeston, the chief aide to commissioner Bud Selig, sent  
ESPN a letter April 21 saying the sport was terminating its $40 
million-a-year deal with the network after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN asked for an injunction preventing baseball from ending the  
deal, an unspecified amount of money and a declaratory judgment 
forcing baseball to grant permission to switch the three telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Shira A.  
Scheindlin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, Beeston said baseball ``regrets  
that it was forced to terminate its contract with ESPN at the end 
of the season. We have had a good relationship with ESPN throughout 
this decade, and we still cling to hopes that it will continue into 
the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to make the switch to accommodate its $4.8 billion  
deal with the NFL. ESPN is available to about 76.2 million homes, 
while ESPN2 is available in 64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, baseball officials blocked the switch and, amidst  
threats of legal action by both sides, the broadcast rights were 
turned back to the teams involved. ESPN said baseball demanded 
about $30 million in financial concessions as a condition for 
giving its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers wound up missing Cal Ripken end his record  
consecutive-games streak and one of Mark McGwire's contests as he 
chased and passed Roger Maris' home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	When ESPN and baseball turned their attention to the matter in  
January, the network said the sport asked for an additional $350 
million for 1999-2002 plus a two-year extension at an annual 
threefold increase over the rights fee agreed to in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about nine hours of programming in the course  
of the almost 500 hours of dedicated MLB coverage we provide each 
year,'' said ESPN president George Bodenheimer. ``It's outrageous 
for baseball to attempt to terminate its agreement with ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to ESPN, the contract states that up to 10 baseball  
games each season can be pre-empted for ``events of significant 
interest''. 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball claims that ESPN is prohibited from  
pre-empting a game without its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	That condition cannot be ``unreasonably withheld,'' but baseball  
officials were unwilling to grant permission last year because they 
refused to take a back seat the NFL during pennant races. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said baseball agreed to move games to ESPN2 in the past --  
it did so last May in order to accommodate the NHL playoffs and 
will do it again for the NHL playoffs on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network also said the sport also has allowed games to  
be moved for World Cup soccer, U.S. Open and U.S. Senior Open golf, 
the College World Series and a Busch auto race. 
</P>
<P>
	But baseball wouldn't allow it last September -- ESPN's first  
year with the entire NFL Sunday night package. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they are willing to put the entire relationship at risk  
over three games that are the lowest-rated every single year,'' 
said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice president of programming. 
</P>
<P>
	September baseball games on ESPN averaged a 1.7 rating in 1997,  
about a quarter of the NFL's average in the same time slots last 
year. A rating point on ESPN equals 760,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's regular-season deal, worth about $40 million a year, was  
originally for 1996-2000 and was extended through 2002. Glover said 
that baseball has offered to renegotiate the deal for about $125 
million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute doesn't effect a separate four-year, postseason  
contract, which runs through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's conflicting games are scheduled for Sept. 12, 19,  
and 26, and two involve the team owned by Selig's family -- the 
Milwaukee Brewers. The games are Milwaukee at Colorado, San 
Francisco at San Diego and Houston at Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Torturer Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAMLOT, Cambodia (AP) -- Until the past few days, the family of  
Kaing Khek Iev had no idea he was a notorious torturer in the Khmer 
Rouge during the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time they'd digested the news, he had disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Kaing Khek Iev -- known as Duch in the Tuol Sleng prison he once  
commanded -- seemed Tuesday to have slipped back into the shadows 
that shielded him for 20 years until news reports recently exposed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch, 56, told his sister, Hong Kim Hong, on Saturday that he  
planned to travel to nearby Battambang. She said Tuesday she hadn't 
seen him since, although the 45-mile trip normally wouldn't take 
more than a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried because my brother hasn't come home,'' said Hong  
Kim Hong, 41, in the one-room shack they share near Samlot, a 
former stronghold of the now-defunct Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Brother and sister were separated during the Khmer Rouge regime  
and were not reunited until 1988. Hong Kim Hong learned of the part 
her brother played in the nightmarish revolution only when 
reporters seeking him started showing up recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always kind to his family,'' Hong Kim Hong said. ``He  
always warned them to do what their leaders told them to do, to 
never contradict their superiors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That advice wouldn't have gone far in Tuol Sleng, the former  
high school the Khmer Rouge turned into a brutal interrogation 
center after seizing power in 1975. Even when a prisoner 
``confessed'' -- to being a traitor or a spy, for example -- Duch 
would accuse them of holding back and would order more torture by 
electricity, water and beatings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review published an  
interview last week in which Duch admitted he signed the orders for 
the torture of at least 14,000 men, women and children at Tuol 
Sleng. 
</P>
<P>
	They were later taken to killing fields on the outskirts of  
Phnom Penh and executed. Only seven inmates survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge were toppled in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion,  
after an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians -- of a population of 7.9 
million -- had died from executions, overwork and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch told the Review he had converted to Christianity in recent  
years and made a living working for foreign aid agencies that 
didn't know his identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch also said he would be prepared to testify against his  
former leaders, most of whom live freely under controversial deals 
granted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups and genocide researchers have expressed  
concerns for Duch's safety. They fear he may be killed to keep him 
from implicating the Khmer Rouge leadership in mass murder, which 
would pressure the government to rescind the de facto amnesties.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Eateries Pay $2M in INS Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix owners and managers of a chain of  
Mexican restaurants agreed to a fine of nearly $2 million for 
hiring illegal immigrants, a federal official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Woodrum, an assistant director of the U.S. Immigration and  
Naturalization Service, said the Filiberto's chain accepted the 
settlement on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodrum said it was ``the biggest fine for a work site  
enforcement case in U.S. history'' and that it involved the largest 
number of illegal hirings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, nearly 200 illegal immigrants were arrested when INS  
raided 15 Filiberto's restaurants. The award-winning cafes are 
franchised by brothers Filiberto, Aurelio, Francisco and Reynaldo 
Tenorio-Quintero, all of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	All four pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to hire  
illegal immigrants and one count of federal tax fraud. An employee 
for the restaurants, Martha Idalia Rios, also pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to employ illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the brothers nor their attorney would comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plea agreement, the brothers and 17 Filiberto's  
managers have agreed to pay a $1.9 million fine and pay all back 
taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers will pay $400,000 of the fine and the brothers will  
pay the balance. The managers did not face criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> NHL Concerned About Penguins Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The National Hockey League, concerned that the  
Pittsburgh Penguins' bankruptcy will delay planning for next 
season, is about to press for the case to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, which supports Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux's bid for  
the team, could ask a U.S. bankruptcy judge as early as Wednesday 
to begin the process to terminate the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the league wants Lemieux to gain control of the team,  
it is concerned that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will 
not hold a confirmation hearing on Lemieux's plan until June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The league earlier set a May 31 date for the Penguins' case to  
be wrapped up, and William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal 
affairs, said June 24 may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, players sign contracts, season ticket-selling campaigns  
begin and game schedules are set. If a Lemieux plan is not approved 
by the end of this month, the league could move on its own, without 
bankruptcy court intervention, to relocate the team or dissolve the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could fold the Penguins' franchise, then award it to  
Lemieux. But, under that scenario, the Penguins probably could not 
play in the Civic Arena because of the current franchise's 
long-term lease to play there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very, very concerned about the 24th,'' Daly told the  
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. ``We're studying whether we can live 
with that date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who is owed $32 million by the team, and his 10  
partners have bid $50 million for the Penguins. The NHL has 
endorsed his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Cuban, a Dallas-based Internet company founder, emerged  
last week as a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother, Dallas employment attorney Brian Cuban, are  
suburban Pittsburgh natives. Brian Cuban said Monday that he and 
his brother have met with Lemieux and also plan to meet with 
current Penguins co-owner Roger Marino and another potential buyer, 
Florida investment banker Charles ``Chip'' Gesner Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Gesner helped Kevin McClatchy buy the Pittsburgh Pirates in  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will meet with anyone willing to save the team and keep  
them in Pittsburgh,'' Brian Cuban said. ``Anything's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harry L. Manion III, Marino's attorney, and Gesner said they  
would welcome a partnership with the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're local guys,'' Gesner said. ``They bring a lot to the  
table. I'd love to have them part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gesner, who represents up to seven undisclosed investors, said  
he is negotiating a reorganization plan for the Penguins. He 
declined to say when his plan would be submitted to Markovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Cuban helped found Broadcast.com, an Internet site that  
carries radio and TV broadcasts, sporting events and concerts on 
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recorded $22.4 million in sales last year, a 145  
percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October. The team has an  
estimated worth of $75 million to $95 million and owes 
approximately $145 million.

<HEADLINE> Did Salt Lake Get Special Info? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Highly sensitive Australian  
diplomatic assessments for Sydney's 2000 Olympics bid were passed 
on to Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Games bid team, it was reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio said confidential briefings  
from Australia's department of foreign affairs and notes by IOC 
member Phil Coles had been obtained by Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said it was clear that Australian diplomats were working for  
the Sydney bid, adding that Salt Lake City's Olympic committee 
received nearly 400 pages of the confidential files of Sydney's bid 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations came as the IOC's executive board decided to  
continue its investigation of Coles in the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal, with a final report due June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also decided to drop its inquiry of Kim Un-yong, a  
member of the ruling panel and the highest-ranking official 
implicated in the scandal. Both Kim and Coles already have received 
severe warnings from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents quoted by the Australian network included letters  
and cables from senior diplomats at 23 foreign missions, with one 
offering to get around rules on gifts to International Olympic 
Committee by having the embassy pay, ABC said. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted a cable from Australia's ambassador to Poland, Tony  
Kevin, in March 1993 about a meeting with Poland's IOC member, 
Wlodzimierz Reczek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not think we misunderstood his message -- there were  
certain conditions,'' the cable said. ``Poland was not a big or 
rich country and would need help from abroad in supporting its team 
for the 2000 Olympics (and) perhaps the Australian Olympic 
Committee could do something to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government had since entered an agreement with  
Poland to bring athletes to train in Australia, paying for the bulk 
of the cost, ABC radio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian diplomats in China had suggested in 1993 the  
Mongolian IOC member ``might be seduced by the attraction of 
Australian mutton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a senior diplomat in Paris had offered to send Prince Albert  
of Monaco three Australian Rules football videos, while suggesting 
they be sent as diplomatic gifts rather than Olympic presents. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC said it was not known if any gifts were actually paid  
for or passed on by diplomatic missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also falling into Salt Lake's hands were individual dossiers on  
each IOC member by Coles, who played a key role in Sydney's 
successful bid.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 36 in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes tore through Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday night, wiping out whole neighborhoods, killing at least 
36 people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,000 homes were destroyed in Oklahoma City alone,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it, the house started shaking and then the big  
rumble,'' said 74-year-old Katherine Burch, who hid in the bathroom 
of her southwest Oklahoma City home during the storm. ``Glass and 
everything flew in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped, debris flew and sirens blared as the twister  
moved from Chickasha to the heavily populated suburbs of Oklahoma 
City, 50 miles to the northeast. The tornado was part of a storm 
system that moved north into neighboring Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and emergency workers combed through the debris as  
darkness fell, searching for survivors while tornado warnings 
remained in effect. Crumpled cars littered two highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real chaotic,'' said Sharla Findley, director of  
community relations at Hillcrest Health Center in Oklahoma City. 
``We've gotten so many patients in I don't know who we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 36 deaths, 26 were in Oklahoma, 10 in Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were killed in Bridge Creek, about 30 miles  
southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the 
state Office of Emergency Management. He said four others died in 
Midwest City, a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City police said at least eight died there. Three  
deaths were reported in Moore, just south of Oklahoma City. Another 
death was reported at Norman Regional Hospital, and two more in 
suburban Del City. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Kansas, 10 were reported dead in Haysville and  
Wichita, about 150 miles due north. Nearly 100 people were reported 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see tonight,'' Battalion Chief  
Bob Thompson of the Sedgwick County Fire Department said. ``We'll 
probably find more deaths. I don't think we've seen the end of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the Midwest Regional Medical Center said it was  
treating at least 100 injured, as did the Hillcrest Health Center. 
Other hospitals were reporting injured as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear there are many more,'' Frizzell said of possible  
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado hit a hospital in Stroud, southwest of Tulsa. There  
were no immediate reports of injury from that storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got lost in a neighborhood I've driven around for 10 years  
because there's no landmarks anymore,'' said Sgt. Jody Suit of Del 
City. ``Out of one square mile, I'd say about one fourth of it is 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suit estimated 750 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in  
Del City. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed over a five-hour  
period beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. 
The National Severe Storms Lab in Norman said the tornado may have 
been a mile wide at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just the perfect type of atmosphere, very unstable and  
with wind shear, to create supercells,'' said National Weather 
Service forecaster David Andra. 
</P>
<P>
	He said forecasters expected the Oklahoma City twister to be  
categorized as at least F-4, the second-strongest tornado 
classification with winds between 207 mph and 260 mph. There were 
at least three tornado warnings still in effect at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and  
several other homes were damaged, said Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick 
County Emergency Preparedness Office. Irvin said multiple injuries 
were reported in both Wichita and Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris' mobile home was demolished with eight people  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris, 19, said. ``We all rolled in it.  
It was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the trailer were in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Karr, 13, said she saw the bay windows in her house  
cave in and the tornado swirling inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out at that point. I was scared for my life,''  
Courtney said. ``I've seen it on TV, but seeing it with my own 
eyes, tearing up my own home ... it is hard to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in Oklahoma City showed hundreds of destroyed  
homes. Heavy damage was reported in Moore, where rows of houses 
were destroyed and scores of trucks overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst storm devastation I have ever heard of,''  
Gov. Frank Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating declared a state of emergency and activated two elements  
of the National Guard to assist in Moore and Chickasha. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, natural gas leaked from several locations and power  
lines and piles of carpet were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson of Moore said as she looked  
toward where her home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson said she and others were watching the weather on  
television when they decided to run into the storm cellar after 
clouds rolled in and rain poured down. Sixteen people and four pets 
were in there with her. 
</P>
<P>
	All survived without injury, but: ``We opened up and everything  
was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Seymore sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck being used as  
a treatment center by a Red Cross volunteer in Moore. Injured 
people waited for ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything fell in on me,'' Ms. Seymore said of her home,  
where she hid in a closet. ``They couldn't hardly get me out of 
there. I couldn't get anybody to find me. I kept hollering `Help!' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Del City, Mary Pat Faris wore a nightgown at the high school  
where she waited for word about missing family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. I heard the popping and then I heard the trees  
crunching and then my house was gone,'' said Ms. Faris, who 
weathered the storm in her bathtub.

<HEADLINE> Record Fine in Price-Fixing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The world's largest producer of graphite and  
carbon products has agreed to pay a record $135 million fine and 
plead guilty to scheming with competitors to fix prices and divide 
the world market among them, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	SGL Carbon Aktiengesellschaft, headquartered in Wiesbaden,  
Germany, is the fourth company the Justice Department has charged 
with scheming in a cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Koehler, SGL Carbon's chief executive officer, has also  
agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine against an 
individual, according to papers filed in U.S. District Court in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme, from 1992 until 1997, forced steelmakers to pay  
higher, noncompetitive prices to manufacture consumer items, the 
Justice Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SGL Carbon agreed to pay the fine ``to resolve the issue and  
avoid potentially lengthy litigation,'' a company spokesman in 
Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charged that SGL Carbon and its co-conspirators  
used code names and met in the Far East, Europe and the United 
States to rig the price and production volume of graphite 
electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartel companies produce graphite electrodes for a  
fast-growing segment of the steel industry -- mini-mills -- that now 
account for half of U.S. steel production, the Justice Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The electrodes are large columns generate intense heat needed to  
melt scrap and further refine steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused agreed to increase prices, eliminate discounts and  
allocate the volume and region each competitor could sell the 
electrodes in, the government said. They also agreed to restrict 
non-conspiring competitors' access to new technology, the charge 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of steel companies are seeking unspecified compensation  
from SGL Carbon, the spokesman said. The company has settled some 
cases in Canada and is working to settle cases in the United 
States. It has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest previous antitrust fine was $110 million from  
America's leading producer of graphite electrodes, UCAR 
International Inc., which pleaded guilty a year ago to scheming in 
the same cartel.

	Tornado Death Toll Expected To Rise  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma authorities say the death toll  
from last night's devastating tornadoes is expected to rise because 
destruction is just ``so massive.'' At least 45 people are 
confirmed dead in Oklahoma and Kansas. Officials are sifting 
through row after row of leveled houses and stores, looking for 
more victims. ``We have whole communities that simply aren't there 
anymore,'' Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told NBC's ``Today'' show. 
President Clinton promised today to declare several Oklahoma and 
Kansas counties disaster areas, which would provide federal aid to 
those areas.

	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- Refugees streamed into Albania today with  
fresh reports of Serb forces using extortion and murder to push 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. More than 2,000 refugees had crossed 
the border by midafternoon, many repeating similar stories of 
forces demanding money from ethnic Albanian refugees, and gunning 
down those who didn't comply. Officials say more than 250,000 
refugees have headed south from Kukes, but more than 100,000 remain 
in the Kukes area and do not want to leave.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO downed a Yugoslav MiG-29  
fighter jet in a dogfight over Serbia and struck a hydraulics 
factory, fuel storage depots and armored vehicles today. It was the 
first air-to-air confrontation since the early days of the NATO 
bombing campaign. Meanwhile, cities and towns across Yugoslavia 
were slowly restoring electricity and water after NATO jets blasted 
power plants in strikes aimed at disrupting the Yugoslav military. 
Serbia lost 70 percent of its electricity.

	Gov't Workers Get No Respect on TV

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new study shows that television tends to  
depict government officials as evil or bumbling. The Center for 
Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan research organization, 
studied prime-time television over the last four decades to see how 
the shows presented elected officials, civil servants, law 
enforcers, teachers and other government workers. It found teachers 
and police fared the best, and office-seekers the worst. Elected 
officials had more bad guys than other TV occupations. Postal 
workers are often shown as lazy, inept malcontents.

	Newspaper Circulation Declines  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite some gains by larger newspapers, overall  
daily newspaper circulation declined by 0.5 percent in the six 
months ending in March, an industry association reported. The top 
ten papers with circulations over half a million, including the New 
York Times and Washington Post, reported a gain of 0.02 percent 
over the same six-month period a year ago, according to data 
released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The Newspaper 
Association has launched an effort to boost readership at a time 
when consumers face more choices for getting news, including the 
Internet and television and radio sources.

titles. Following Holdsclaw, former ABL players were the next three 
selections: Yolanda Griffith to the Sacramento Monarchs, Natalie 
Williams to the Utah Starzz and DeLisha Milton to the Los Angeles 
Sparks. The ABL, a rival of the WNBA, folded midway through its

<P>
                   *Associated Press Photographer    	
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- I drove into the heart of the storm, my  
police scanner screaming, the radio broadcasting warnings of the 
approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The sky turned midnight dark and hail pounded the roof of my  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rain stopped and there was no more hail. Just quiet. An  
eerie quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, debris flew and I saw it -- the funnel cloud, a  
quarter- to a half-mile away, straddling the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	I have chased tornadoes for a quarter-century, but this was the  
first I had seen on the ground. I stood there, a half-mile away, 
shooting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	I got back in my car and began driving. I stopped and shot more  
pictures. By now, it was so close I had to use a wide-angle lens. 
</P>
<P>
	I drove, I stopped, I shot. And then I realized the storm was so  
close I had no place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	I got out of my truck at an overpass and spotted a woman  
standing beside her van. I yelled at her to get against the pillars 
supporting the overpass. She ran to the side of her van for her two 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	I helped her get one girl out of the car seat, then I pushed and  
shoved them to the pillar and put my back to the storm. I stopped 
shooting when the funnel was maybe 150 feet away. By then, I could 
no longer stand. 
</P>
<P>
	I was hit by flying debris. I felt one of my two pagers slide  
out of its holder and bang against me. The pager went up in the 
tornado and vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	I hugged the little girls and the woman and kept telling it  
would be OK and to keep their faces down and not to look up. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was gone. The funnel crossed the expressway and we were  
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as I could stand, I began taking pictures again. The  
wind was still strong. The funnel cloud was less than 50 yards 
away. The wind was howling and I could barely stand, but the storm 
was moving away. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman asked if it was safe to continue on to Lawton, and I  
said it seemed OK. 
</P>
<P>
	In all the confusion, I forgot one basic rule of journalism.  
</P>
<P>
	I never got her name.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Twister Raked Ground for Miles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- The biggest twister to tear through  
Oklahoma was a monster unlike most any other tornado, cutting a 
path one mile wide and tearing up miles of the flat countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's at the outer edge,'' said Dr. Fred Carr, director of  
the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology. ``Just a few 
percent will do that in a given year. This is at the extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said most tornadoes only measure 500 to 600 feet wide and  
reach the ground briefly, skipping across the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest of Monday's tornadoes was classified F-5 -- the  
highest on the Fujita scale, which measures storm severity -- 
meaning it had winds in excess of 260 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a whopper even for the heart of a region used to  
twisters. Tornado Alley, a swath running from west Texas through 
Oklahoma and Kansas to Iowa, is ripe for stormy conditions because 
of colliding air masses that occur each spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's storms left at least 43 dead in Oklahoma and Kansas and  
were the deadliest to hit Oklahoma since April 9, 1947, when a 
twister killed 113. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that makes this unique is putting a violent tornado  
through a heavily populated area,'' said Harold Brooks, a 
researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman. 
``That's the primary reason for the high death toll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptional tornadoes such as Monday's are the product of  
supercells, considered the kings of thunderstorms. They soar 60,000 
feet into the atmosphere -- nearly twice as high as the zone where 
jet aircraft fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Most thunderstorms die in an hour or so, but an anvil-shaped  
supercell persists for hours and travels hundreds of miles, hurling 
the most destructive weather in its path. 
</P>
<P>
	The big tornado in Oklahoma formed the classic dark funnel as it  
sucked debris along its path. Tornadoes often are masked by rain 
and can't be seen, but not this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sucked our hair straight up,'' said a witness, Kathy  
Martin. ``I'm here to tell you, whoever did that movie `Twister' 
has got it down.''

	URENA, Venezuela (AP) -- The presidents of Venezuela and Colombia  
on Tuesday hugged, joked, and pledged to improve bilateral ties -- 
two months after an initial meeting was canceled over what Colombia 
called imprudent remarks by Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian President Andres Pastrana refused to meet the  
Venezuelan leader in this hot border city on March 10 after Chavez 
declared himself ``neutral'' in Colombia's rebel war and suggested 
guerrillas were a legitimate fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
	Both presidents indicated Tuesday that the incident was  
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	``That phase has been overcome,'' Chavez said during a joint  
news conference with Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, steered clear

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- A judge ordered the arrest of a  
former army chief and an ex-defense minister on corruption charges 
Tuesday, a sign of growing civilian control over the 
once-untouchable military. 
</P>
<P>
	The order comes amid allegation that Mario Hung Pacheco, the  
former army leader, and Cristobal Corrales took money in 1997 in 
exchange for licensing a private security company. Prosecutors 
claimed neither had the power to issue the license. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges once would have been unthinkable in Honduras, where  
military held great political influence in the years after

<HEADLINE> Makers of Fake Viagra Settle Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The makers of a fake version of the impotence  
drug Viagra have agreed to settle government charges that they 
falsely advertised the effectiveness of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, American  
Urological Corp., owned by David Brady, and several affiliated 
companies must give up more than $2 million in frozen assets and 
are barred from making any claims about their products without the 
support of scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, Brady and his businesses marketed  
such products as ``Vaegra,'' ``Testosterone-21,'' and ``Urophil'' 
as treatments for impotence. The companies falsely advertised that 
their products had been developed by legitimate medical firms and 
that they had been proven effective in eliminating impotence in up 
to 94 percent of men, the FTC said in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, the businesses played on the  
popularity of prescription medications, such as Viagra, the Pfizer 
Inc. drug that received Food and Drug Administration approval and 
went on the market last year, to target consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Illegally cashing in on the publicity and popularity  
surrounding a bona fide medical product is bad enough, but 
exploiting consumers who are desperate for a cure is even worse,'' 
said Jodie Bernstein, director of the commission's bureau of 
consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Brady must post a $6 million bond for 10  
years before he can market or sell any impotence product again. If 
he decides to make claims about the benefits of any other type of 
product, he must post a $1 million bond for the first five years 
after the order becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also bars the companies from misrepresentations  
that their products can eliminate impotence or are sold by 
legitimate medical enterprises or that the FDA has approved the 
ingredients as safe for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless they have reliable scientific evidence to bolster the  
claims, the companies also cannot make claims about the 
performance, efficacy or safety of their products or of any food or 
drugs they may market. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which does not constitute an admission of  
wrongdoing, was filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE>  Tornadoes Kill 43 in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The death toll stood at 43 today after  
fierce tornadoes destroyed entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and 
Kansas. One monstrous twister chewed across miles of Tornado Alley 
for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner said 38 people were killed in  
Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, spokesman Ray Blakeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined Oklahoma-Kansas death toll makes this the deadliest  
tornado outbreak since 42 people were killed last year in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest twister formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma  
City and cut a path at least a half-mile wide. While many tornadoes 
are short-lived, this one stayed on the ground for about four 
hours, said Wayne Ruff, a National Weather Service meteorologist. 
Local TV stations followed it with live broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage ``looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine  
stories tall, it's spread out over a large area,'' Oklahoma City 
assistant fire chief Jon Hansen said, referring to the federal 
building bombing in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More severe thunderstorms with scattered twisters rippled across  
the Plains this morning, and tornado warnings were posted for parts 
of central Oklahoma. A tornado watch covered much of the rest of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton declared 11 Oklahoma counties  
and one in Kansas federal disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 miles north of Oklahoma City, a tornado spawned by the  
same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses 
and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kan., and its suburb of 
Haysville. Hospitals treated more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see,'' said Bob Thompson, a fire  
battalion chief in Sedgwick County, Kan. He said more deaths were 
possible, and dogs were used today to search the rubble of homes in 
Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in  
Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his 
companions were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris said. ``We all rolled in it. It  
was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the dead included 11 people in Bridge Creek, about  
30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman 
for the state Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Others died in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore, Del  
City and Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really just getting started on the foot-by-foot  
search,'' Clayton Taylor, a Red Cross spokesman, said today in 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have whole communities that simply aren't there anymore,''  
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told NBC's ``Today'' show. ``It 
certainly looks like a huge battle has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of houses destroyed in the Oklahoma City area  
approached 2,000. Cars were tossed about and crushed. Natural gas 
spewed from ruptured lines. Utility poles were splintered into 
kindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in the Oklahoma City metro area treated 563 people for  
tornado-related injuries, police Capt. Charles Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the war in Germany. I've had bombs fall all  
around me. Now I've been in a tornado,'' 73-year-old Anna Knerr 
said today in a shelter in Midwest City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Knerr said she and her husband hid in a closet before the  
storm hit. ``Then there just was this creepy feeling,'' she said. 
``The next thing I know I was covered. The roof just collapsed on 
me.'' She and her husband crawled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman said the tornado  
may have been a mile wide at times. The weather service's David 
Andra predicted the twister would be categorized at least an F4, 
the second-strongest tornado classification, defined as a storm 
with wind at 207 to 260 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It would probably be late today before the staff at the  
laboratory could determine just how strong the tornado was, 
researcher Harold Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system also spawned twisters in north and west Texas, but  
did no major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
	The main tornado in Oklahoma formed near Chickasha, about 45  
miles southwest of the capital. It plowed across the flat 
countryside, toppling trees, power lines, buildings and cars until 
it ripped into south Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service issued its first tornado warning at  
4:49 p.m. Monday as twisters started over rural parts of the state. 
Television stations started live coverage a few minutes later, 
following the storms with cameras and radar for about two hours 
before the tornadoes slammed into the Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, tornadoes killed 42 people around Kissimmee, Fla., on  
Feb. 22-23, and 34 people died in the area of Birmingham, Ala., on 
April 8.

<HEADLINE> Senator Targets Baseball Exemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator whose state recently  
approved $320 million for new stadium construction said Tuesday 
baseball could lose its cherished antitrust exemption unless teams 
share more of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said he also would target  
professional football, which he said has been able to obtain 
lucrative television contracts because it essentially has a limited 
antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned  
in recent years,'' Specter said. ``One would think some of that 
giant revenue windfall might trickle down and be used to help 
finance new ballparks and stadiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, a member of the Senate Judiciary antitrust  
subcommittee, introduced a bill that would require teams to set 
aside 10 percent of television revenue and use the money to pay up 
to 50 percent of stadium construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, baseball, basketball, football and hockey would get  
broader exemptions allowing their leagues to deny a team's request 
to move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter brought up the issue with Assistant Attorney General  
Joel I. Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust 
division, during a Senate hearing. Specter asked Klein to look into 
the possibility of removing the exemption and plans to pursue that 
course if teams oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter questioned why the public must commit more money for  
stadium construction when schools and housing are in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have long been concerned with the pressure put upon  
communities by baseball and football clubs seeking new playing 
facilities where, responding to a team's overt or tacit threat to 
move to another city, government leaders feel compelled to have 
taxpayers finance the lion's share'' of costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a reference to a recent bidding war in New England over  
the Patriots football team. After threatening to move to Hartford, 
Conn., the Patriots decided to stay in Massachusetts when the state 
came up with a $70 million plan for infrastructure improvements at 
their stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge signed a law that  
allocates $320 million for four new stadiums, two each in 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires team owners to finance one-third of the stadium  
costs. The rest would be split between the state and the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's bill would apply to any stadiums not yet completed, so  
it could affect those in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's antitrust exemption, granted in a 1922 U.S. Supreme  
Court ruling, allows baseball owners to block the sale of 
franchises without violating federal laws that prohibit unnecessary 
restraint on trade. Specter threatened to target that exemption 
previously, when the Pirates considered moving out of Pittsburgh.

<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes too numerous to count roared  
across Oklahoma and Kansas, killing at least 34 people and bringing 
destruction to cities and small communities alike. 
</P>
<P>
	One unusually large and powerful twister formed about 45 miles  
southwest of Oklahoma City on Monday evening, killing 29 people and 
injuring hundreds as it moved north and east, cutting a path half a 
mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories  
tall, it's spread out over a large area,'' said Oklahoma City 
assistant fire chief Jon Hansen, referring to the federal building 
bombing four years ago. Hansen was also on the scene during that 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 miles due north, a tornado spawned by the same storm  
system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed 
at least five people in Wichita, Kan., and its southern suburb of 
Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office  
said early today the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when 
authorities realized victims had been counted twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see,'' said Bob Thompson, a  
battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. ``We'll 
probably find more deaths. I don't think we've seen the end of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake,  
Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in  
Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his 
companions were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris said. ``We all rolled in it. It  
was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the dead included 11 people in the community of  
Bridge Creek, about 30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben 
Frizzell, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest died in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore,  
Del City and Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows and rows of houses were reduced to rubble. Cars were tossed  
about and crushed. Natural gas spewed from ruptured lines. Power 
poles were reduced to kindling and broken, twisted wires fluttered 
in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the devastation we've seen so far, we fear that  
there may be more,'' said Oklahoma City police Sgt. Nate Tarver of 
the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, tornado warnings were still in effect for areas  
near Muskogee and north of Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	At least half a dozen other tornadic storms formed over five  
hours Monday evening, mainly in central and northeast Oklahoma. 
Some sprouted funnel clouds, but there were no immediate reports of 
widespread damage or deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The system also spawned twisters in north and west Texas, but  
did no major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the main tornado formed near Chickasha, about 45  
miles southwest of the capital city. It skipped its way across the 
flat Oklahoma countryside, toppling trees, power lines, 
outbuildings and cars until it ripped into south Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Lab in Norman said the tornado may  
have been a mile wide at times. Weather service forecaster David 
Andra predicted the twister would be categorized at lest an F-4, 
the second-strongest tornado classification, with winds between 207 
mph and 260 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas, Wichita's tornado tore a 10-mile path that reached 3 1/4  
miles wide. Smaller twisters struck Sumner and Butler counties, as 
well as other parts of Sedgwick County, but none caused substantial 
damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and  
activated two National Guard units. Kansas Gov. Bill Graves 
declared a state of disaster for Sedgwick County. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency, was to survey the damage today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, Catherine Meyers hid under a mattress when the storm  
hit her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mattress didn't help me,'' she said, bleeding from her head  
and arm. ``I got hit four or five times on the head by something. 
I've lost a lot of blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pat Faris, who weathered the storm in her bathtub, wore a  
nightgown at Del City High School and waited for word about missing 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. I heard the popping and then I heard the trees  
crunching and then my house was gone,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. treasury bonds fell Tuesday amid renewed  
fears that the Fed might hike interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 25/32  
points, or by $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.71 percent from Monday's 
5.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices dropped after two more strong economic reports fed fears  
that the Federal Reserve Board might hike interest rates to cool 
down the economy before it overheats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported that a key gauge of future  
economic activity rose for the sixth straight month in March. The 
research group's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 
percent in March, pushed higher in part by rising stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second confirmation that the housing market remains robust,  
the Commerce Department reported that completion of privately owned 
housing units rose 12.6 percent in March, the fastest pace since 
April 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities ranged between 
down 7/32 and down 11/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on three-month Treasury bills was 4.61 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction price to 
4.49 percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.68 percent, while the 
discount increased 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction 
price to 4.51 percent. One-year yields held steady at 4.77 percent 
as the discount remained unchanged from Monday at 4.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from Monday's 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 from 123 5/16 late Monday. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.32 percent from 5.30 percent 
late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Speedway Gets Tape of Flying Wheel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Investigators examined a fan's videotape  
that shows a wheel flying into the grandstand where three people 
were killed and eight others injured during last weekend's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't show it from start to finish, but it's still better  
than anything we've gotten up to this point,'' track spokesman 
Jerry Gappens said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gappens said the camcorder videotape was shot by a spectator who  
was sitting in the terrace boxes atop the grandstands in the fourth 
turn during Saturday night's Pep Boys Indy Racing League event. 
</P>
<P>
	The spectator turned the tape over to Lowe's Motor Speedway on  
the condition his identity not be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators hope to find a videotape that will show them how  
the wheel snapped off one of the cars in the three-car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	They also want to determine how much clearance there was between  
the wheel and the top of a safety fence that reaches 15 feet above 
the track surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The information would help them determine if any safety changes  
could be made to the cars and how much the height of the fence 
should be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The spectator's videotape that was turned over to speedway  
officials Monday night shows neither the wreck itself nor the wheel 
going over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see it after it clears the fence and before it hit. It was  
already on its way down and it was coming in high,'' Gappens said. 
``But at least we see the object coming into the stands. It's the 
first time we've seen that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was carried by Speedvision, a small cable network that  
was broadcasting an IRL race for the first time. Speedvision's 
cameras did not capture the start of the wreck or any debris flying 
into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television video usually helps quite a bit,'' Gappens said,  
``but that's not the case this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without conclusive evidence of how much clearance there was  
between the wheel and the top of the catch fence, speedway 
officials are still considering raising the height. The track's 
engineers and architects have been studying the matter since the 
accident, and a decision is likely soon, Gappens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully in the next day or two we'll have something more to  
share in that regard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, a funeral was held for the first of the victims. A  
service for Jeffrey Patton, 32, was held in his hometown of 
Hickory. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled Wednesday for Randy Pyatte, 21, of  
Connelly Springs. The parents of the third victim, Barry Mobley, 
41, of Statesville, planned to take his body back to their home in 
Georgia for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, remained in Carolinas Medical Center in 
Charlotte. She was in critical condition with brain and lung 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials held the first of several counseling sessions  
for any of the nearly 50,000 spectators who want to discuss the 
accident. Three 90-minute sessions were offered Tuesday in 
Charlotte and two more were scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday 
nights in Hildebran.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Hear Disgruntled Voices on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When disgruntled customer Phil Van der Vossen  
launched a Web page in February to bash Internet retailer Buy.com, 
he was trying to be a thorn in their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Little did he expect that two months later, he would be on an  
all-expense paid trip to California to meet with the consumer 
electronics merchant's top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never imagined that they would ever care enough to even look  
at the site, no less fly me out there to talk about how to improve 
their business,'' the 20-year-old University of Maryland student 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people like Van der Vossen are taking their rage to  
the Internet these days, venting their displeasure over everything 
from Dunkin Donuts to Bally Total Fitness health clubs to an 
audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	And because of the widespread reach of the Internet, a growing  
number of companies are starting to pay attention, realizing that 
bad publicity online can be a threat to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Some businesses are assigning staffers or hiring cyber-snooping  
specialists to scour for vengeful Web pages and eavesdrop in chat 
rooms. Others are buying up the domain names most likely to be used 
for negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Internet universe, nothing replaces word of mouth and  
word of mouth can spread fast,'' said Darryl Peck, chairman and 
chief executive of Cyberian Outpost, an online computer seller. 
``You can't ignore what is being said out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is the fastest growing means of communication and  
information in society today. Last year, about 37 percent of all 
U.S. households were online, compared with about 27 percent in 
1997, according to the New York-based Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	As cyberspace grows, so do the number of anti-company Web sites  
and discussion groups. Consumers are quickly realizing that the 
Internet is an unregulated space where they can reach people 
worldwide instantly for very little cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a very effective new weapon for the  
consumer,'' said Patricia Sturdevant, general counsel to the 
Washington-based National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
``Before the Internet, unless you had a lot of time or money, there 
wasn't any way to get the public's attention to a problem. Now, you 
can broadcast it to the entire world in an instant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what inspired Van der Vossen to launch his site against  
Buy.com, www.buycrap.cjb.net. He was outraged by the company's 
pricing foul-up for a computer monitor and wanted to warn others to 
not shop at the online store. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy.com had mistakenly priced a Hitachi monitor on its Web site  
at $164.50, which was about $400 below cost. The company took 1,600 
orders before realizing the error. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, shoppers were given mixed messages over whether they would  
get the monitor at the bargain price and some were even charged for 
it on their credit cards without ever receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted people to know that there had been many problems with  
Buy.com and that they couldn't be trusted,'' said Van der Vossen, 
whose site includes links to other anti-Buy.com sites, news 
coverage on the company and direct e-mail to the CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 5,000 people logged on to my site in the first week,  
so I know that people were interested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those people happened to be Buy.com's executives, who  
were trying to keep up with the bad publicity scattered about them 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew many of the things that I was seeing on the Internet  
were true and we needed to start changing them,'' said Greg 
Hawkins, who took over as chief executive about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company has yet to remedy the monitor debacle, the  
experience inspired it to revamp its business. Many of its planned 
changes come directly from comments they read online, including the 
addition of more customer service representatives and telling 
shoppers if an item is in stock or on back-order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cognizant of the things we want to change because they  
were communicated to us over the Internet, on Web sites and in the 
chat rooms,'' Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant pension system TIAA-CREF also learned that watching  
the Web pays off. In the midst of the Asian economic crisis in 
October, someone posted in a CompuServe discussion room that the 
company's Global Equities pension fund had 25 percent of its assets 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fund only had a 5 percent stake in Asia. Since the error  
was caught within days, the company was able to contact the chat 
room mediator and stop a rumor that had the potential to spur an 
exodus of investors from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the Web is like competitive intelligence,'' said Alan  
Shea, who runs the new Internet monitoring company EclipZe. ``You 
need to keep track of who is saying what and who is doing what to 
stay ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping an eye on the Internet keeps companies abreast of  
consumers' opinions, many are still struggling with how to respond 
to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to know whether or not something is a legitimate  
gripe or problem, or whether a company should respond to every Web 
site and posting,'' said Jason Alexander, founder of Ewatch, a 
company that scours the Internet on the behalf of its corporate 
clients and helps them determine when to intervene. ``It's hard to 
decide when to reach out and when to just sit back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies are attempting to protect themselves from an  
organized attack by registering negative domain name themselves. 
Chase Manhattan Bank, for instance, owns ihatechase.com, 
chasesucks.com and chasestinks.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has a media analyst on  
staff who tracks references to the company on the Internet, but its 
policy it to act only when it sees something that infringes on its 
logo or brand identity or defames the company, said spokeswoman Joy 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberian Outpost will join an online discussion only if it feels  
that it will help remedy a problematic situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are there monitoring, but unless it is something that we  
really feel that we need to jump into, we let the customers just 
talk about it themselves,'' said Outpost's CEO Peck. ``Watching the 
Web is an information tool that helps us improve our business.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Force Remains Key Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Pledging to keep up shuttle diplomacy  
until the Kosovo conflict is settled, Russian envoy Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said Tuesday the key issue remains the type of 
peacekeeping force that would be deployed in the Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it would be paramilitary, military or civil forces --  
of course it's subject to negotiations,'' the former Russian prime 
minister told reporters after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be political will, both in Belgrade and NATO,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Chernomyrdin's second meeting with Annan in less than a  
week, and the Russian envoy said the U.N. secretary-general ``is 
determined to participate in a settlement to the crisis ... because 
there is no other organization which has as much experience as the 
United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in  
Belgrade late last week, Chernomyrdin flew to Washington and spent 
2 1/2 hours with President Clinton on Monday discussing the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian envoy met Vice President Al Gore and top U.S.  
foreign policy advisers Tuesday morning before flying to New York 
to see Annan. He also held talks with Norway's Foreign Minister 
Knut Vollebaek, chairman of the Organization of Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, whose monitoring mission left Kosovo just 
before the NATO bombing began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising Russia's diplomatic efforts, Vollebaek said there was  
still no ``major breakthrough. But there are positive signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian minister, whose country is a NATO member, said  
Milosevic must accept an armed force for Kosovo ``because there is 
no way that any of us would be willing to compromise on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can compromise on some of the other elements. But  
the necessity to have an armed, military force in Kosovo -- that is 
a prerequisite (without) which we cannot implement any peace 
agreement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that NATO might be willing to compromise, for  
example, on whether all Yugoslav forces have to withdraw from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	When he met Milosevic some time ago, Vollebaek recalled that the  
Yugoslav leader ``discarded any kind of international presence'' in 
Kosovo. Now, he said, ``there seems to be more of a willingness 
from Milosevic's side to have an international component, an 
international force, in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is demanding that its armed troops ensure the safety of  
refugees, but Milosevic has indicated that he would only allow a 
non-NATO force, armed with no more than personal weapons and under 
U.N. supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what needs to be done to stop the bombing, Vollebaek  
replied: ``I think we need a sign from Milosevic that there is a 
willingness from his side to ... accommodate some of the demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we see that sign, of course there should be a possibility  
for stopping the bombing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vollebaek said he believes the involvement of both Russia and  
the United Nations is key to the search for a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin gave few details of his talks in his brief exchange  
with the media, saying he planned to return to Moscow and might 
then go to Belgrade again and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Appeal Court Hears Casey Martin Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The PGA Tour took its fight against Casey  
Martin's golf cart to a federal appeals court today, arguing that 
last year's decision allowing the disabled golfer to ride 
fundamentally alters the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an elite athletic competition, certain rules must apply  
equally to everyone,'' PGA Tour attorney Andrew Hurwitz told a 
three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walking rule is a substantial rule, expressly designed to  
inject stress and fatigue, and impact the outcome of the game,'' 
Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that walking in golfing ``determines how players must  
go from shot to shot, just as the dribbling rule determines how 
basketball players must go down the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who has a rare circulatory disorder in his right leg  
that makes it painful for him to walk long distances, won the right 
to ride a cart on the pro tour under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, which bars discrimination against the disabled in 
the workplace, public accommodations and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's attorney contended that the PGA, whether it likes it or  
not, is subject to the ADA and he scoffed at the suggestion that 
walking is a necessary part of playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stress is what causes golfers to wear down, not walking up  
an,nd down hills,'' said attorney Roy Reardon. ``They're not doing 
that at any speed. Stress is the mental stress, the same kind of 
mental stress Casey Martin suffers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin limped into court early and sat quietly during the  
hearing, flanked by his brother and his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges asked only a few questions during the hearing and a  
ruling was not expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA's appeal is based on the argument that it threatens the  
essence of the sport by giving an unfair advantage to one golfer, 
while his competitors must trudge from tee to tee. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin has had an advantage, it hasn't been reflected on the  
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ruling, Martin's game has waned. After a top-10 finish  
four weeks ago, he has missed the cut in his last three 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Martin missed the cut at the Nike Lakeland Classic,  
an event he won in 1998, and finished 14th in his next tournament. 
After missing yet another cut, he took a month off and returned in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest success was a seventh-place tie good for $11,250 at  
the Nike Louisiana Open, but things have been rough going since. He 
has missed three cuts, the latest disappointment coming this week 
at the Nike Upstate Classic in Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Martin thinks his play is all right  
</P>
<P>
	``It just takes some patience,'' he said this week. ``When I've  
played relaxed, I've played really well. Maybe I'm pressing a 
little bit.''

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Rocket Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
malfunctioned shortly after liftoff Tuesday night and placed a 
communication satellite in the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second flight of a Delta III. The inaugural  
flight eight months ago ended in a midair explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a significant disappointment to Boeing and, I  
believe, to Boeing's customers,'' said Gale Schluter, vice 
president and general manager of Boeing's expendable launch 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we rushed into this,'' he said at a somber news  
conference early Wednesday. ``We had a very comprehensive 
return-to-flight program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage used to boost the Orion satellite ignited  
properly the first time, but not the second time. That left the 
satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the Pacific for  
Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high perch. It 
was unclear whether the satellite could be boosted into the right 
orbit using on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third time in less than a month that a satellite has  
ended up in the wrong orbit. The two other satellites were launched 
aboard the Air Force's Titan IV rocket, built by Lockheed Martin 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday night's  
launch. Not only did it mark the Delta III's return to flight, it 
was the fifth launch attempt in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way down to zero, but  
the rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the error and aimed for a 
Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to review data 
from last week's botched Titan IV launch, which stranded a military 
communication satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rockets use similar upper-stage engines.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole industry is having its problems at the moment,''  
Boeing mission director Rich Murphy said Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff. The rocket used up all 
of its hydraulic fluid for steering and broke apart when it 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's debut ended up being a $225 million disaster and  
cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed. 
Tuesday's mission cost $230 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Struggle Off the Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans and Cubans traded high-fives and  
handshakes on baseball diamonds in Baltimore and Havana. But in the 
diplomatic arena, it's hardball of another sort. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly sports competition was on display when the Orioles  
played a Cuban all-star team Monday night, and five weeks ago when 
the two squared off in Cuba, with Baltimore winning 3-2 in 11 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a case of ``Baseball Si, Politics No.'' That's in marked  
contrast to the four-decade-old U.S.-Cuba government feud. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point is the recently concluded spring session of the  
53-member U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the United States and Cuba engage in long-distance  
verbal volleying. In Geneva, however, it was a close-quarter 
diplomatic battle over a U.S.-backed resolution criticizing Cuba's 
human rights policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution expressed concern at the ``continued violation of  
human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba, such as freedom of 
expression, association and assembly and rights associated with the 
administration of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, it seemed an unequal struggle, involving the  
world's richest and most powerful country and a small poor neighbor 
that sticks by an old-style communist system widely discredited 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission takes up an anti-Cuba resolution each year,  
usually introduced by the United States. This year, Cuba was tossed 
a diplomatic curve ball when two former communist allies of Cuba -- 
the Czech Republic and Poland -- introduced it. 
</P>
<P>
	A wrathful Cuban delegation derided the Czechs and Poles, saying  
they were ``doing the dirty work of the United States.'' Carlos 
Lage, one of President Fidel Castro's most trusted lieutenants, set 
the tone, insisting it was unseemly for the United States to pass 
judgment on Cuba's human rights situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lage contended nearly 1 million Americans are homeless, 43  
million have no health insurance and 20 percent are functional 
illiterates. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, he asked: ``Where, in Cuba, are the illiterates,  
the children without schools and the teachers without classrooms? 
Where is there a single citizen without health care coverage?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He derided U.S. policies toward Cuba, including an economic  
embargo, as ``criminal, failed and ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the embargo, which was eased earlier this year to allow  
more regulated sales of food and pesticides, elicits a measure of 
sympathy for Cuba internationally. Many countries sense that 
American hostility toward the island has contributed to the 
rigidity of Cuba's internal policies. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one reason some countries close ranks behind Cuba each  
year on the anti-Cuba resolution. In 1998, it was defeated 19-16, 
with 18 abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left nothing to  
chance. She telephoned at least five Latin American foreign 
ministers seeking support for the resolution. The day of the vote, 
her top aides lobbied into the early hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an avowed admirer of Castro,  
also worked the phones, urging his Latin American colleagues to 
vote ``no.'' In response, the State Department's top aide for 
economic affairs, Alan Larson, abruptly canceled long-planned 
economic consultations in Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro himself was busy lobbying. He requested a week's  
postponement in the Geneva vote so he could do some arm twisting at 
a Caribbean regional summit in the Dominican Republic in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most controversial bid for support occurred when El  
Salvador agreed to abstain from the vote after Cuba promised to 
commute the death sentences of two Salvadorans convicted in 1997 
hotel bombings in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem for Cuba, however, was the conviction of four  
dissidents who were sentenced in March to prison terms of 3 1/2 to 5 
years. Cuba said the four were guilty of ``incitement to 
sedition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cuba had a new law imposing sentences of up to 20 years on  
Cubans found to be cooperating with U.S. attempts to promote a 
transition to democracy in Cuba. Cuba's critics saw the law as 
punishment for independent thinkers. Cuba says it is merely an 
attempt to punish those who collaborate with the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks of jockeying, the resolution passed April 23 on  
a vote of 21-20, with 12 abstentions. When the tally was announced, 
one Cuban delegate wept. 
</P>
<P>
	For Cuba, some of the sting from that vote may have been eased  
by the outcome Monday night in Baltimore: Cuba 12, Orioles 6.

<HEADLINE> 10 Reported Dead in Wichita Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The unwelcome guest tore the roof off the  
Karr home and barged inside as the family huddled in terror and 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out at that point. I was scared for my life,''  
said 13-year-old Courtney Karr, who cowered with her 15-year-old 
sister, Jessie, and their parents as a killer tornado ripped their 
house apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people were killed and up to 100 people were injured by  
Monday night's twister in Wichita and its southern suburb of 
Haysville. A tornado spawned by the same storm killed at least 29 
people in the Oklahoma City area 150 miles due south. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney watched in horror as her house's bay windows collapsed  
and the twister's winds swirled inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen it on TV, but seeing it with my own eyes, tearing up  
my own home ... it is hard to explain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was trapped in the basement for about half an hour  
until the storm subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister cut a path 3 1/4 miles wide and 10 miles long through  
Haysville and southern Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the destruction was in Haysville, where parts of the  
older business district were demolished, including a bank, real 
estate company, chiropractor's office, a 10-unit apartment complex 
and several homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad tracks were uprooted and metal, lifted and flung about  
like paper, was wrapped around trees near the ruins of the 
two-block long Norland Plastics plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Graves declared Sedgwick County a disaster area early  
today and called on the National Guard, which set up a temporary 
morgue and an aid station. Emergency officials used military 
vehicles to evacuate some homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers were going door-to-door to look for people who  
might be trapped or injured. Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for 
the Sedgwick County Fire Department, said the death toll was 
expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've seen the end of it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wichita, two trailer parks were devastated. Insulation, metal  
and board fragments littered the ground. A yellow toddler's slide 
and a red Schwinn bicycle floated in the muck at one park. 
</P>
<P>
	Haysville resident Duane Moore and his wife, Vicky, hid with  
their three dogs in a neighbor's storm shelter, but high winds 
yanked the door off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen anything yet; I just noticed I don't have a  
house,'' Vicky Moore said as she, her husband and the dogs walked 
out of their shattered neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Leader Dissolves Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- Kuwait's leader dissolved Parliament on Tuesday,  
hours after lawmakers threatened to oust his Islamic Affairs 
minister for mistakes printed in 120,000 copies of the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
	Jabar al-Ahmed al-Sabah called for July 3 elections for a new  
Parliament, nearly a year and a half ahead of schedule. The emir 
said lawmakers misused their constitutional rights by demanding the 
no-confidence vote against Ahmed al-Kulaib. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional five-hour session earlier Tuesday, Kuwaiti  
lawmakers lambasted al-Kulaib for his ``political responsibility'' 
in allowing the Islamic holy book to be printed and released with 
verses missing, repeated or misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbas al-Khodari, the legislator who had requested the grilling,  
accused him of attempting to ``disfigure the faith of Muslims'' in 
Kuwait and abroad, where the free copies of the Koran were 
distributed. The mistake was noticed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a horrendous mistake that cannot be forgiven,''  
al-Khodari said, denying the impeachment calls were political. 
``Trying to correct it later does not make it go away. ... This has 
to do with the great book of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Kulaib acknowledged the errors, saying they were made in the  
collating and binding stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is denying that an unintentional mistake has been  
made,'' he said. ``The mistakes do not include any intended change 
in the meaning'' of verses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, 20 lawmakers in the 50-seat house submitted two  
motions for a vote of no-confidence in al-Kulaib. A simple majority 
would have been needed to impeach him, and his removal in a vote 
scheduled for next Tuesday appeared likely had the emir not 
dissolved Parliament or chosen to reshuffle his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait's deputy prime minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah,  
had urged lawmakers not to follow through with impeachment. 
Parliament and the Cabinet, he said, ``can fight over the economy 
or politics, but we should not fight over religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Sabah, who was visibly upset during the session, said he  
believes in democracy, but is ``sorry we have reached the stage of 
burning down our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two lawmakers spoke in support of the Islamic Affairs  
minister, accusing their colleagues of early campaigning for 2000 
elections and of salting wounds instead of trying to heal them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976 and in 1986, the house was dissolved following  
lawmakers' severe criticism of Cabinet members. Each time, it 
remained dissolved for years. This is the first time a Kuwaiti emir 
has followed the constitution and called for elections within two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislature was elected in 1996 and the next elections had  
been expected in October 2000. Lawmakers have been criticized for 
an inability to address the country's problems, including carrying 
out economic reforms. Kuwait has the only elected parliament among 
the Arab Gulf countries.

<HEADLINE> New Format for News Story Coding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- News industry organizations have agreed to a new  
format for coding news stories to improve their usefulness on the 
Internet, in text archives and on devices such as pagers and 
personal digital assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	The coding language, called News Industry Text Format, will  
benefit news organizations by lowering editing and transmission 
costs while making it easy to repackage news for multiple media. 
</P>
<P>
	NITF coding can be used to mark parts of articles -- names of  
newsmakers, for example -- to make it easier for search engines to 
identify them. It can also be used to automatically identify the 
story's headline, editor's note and writer's byline, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire services, including The Associated Press, plan to use the  
coding for new media products. NITF uses XML coding, or Extensible 
Markup Language, which is a new format for identifying specific 
portions of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	NITF was endorsed at an April 23 meeting in Dallas of wire  
services, newspaper front-end system vendors and industry groups, 
including the Newspaper Association of America, International Press 
Telecommunications Council and the Media Center at the American 
Press Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Radio-Television News Directors Association previously  
announced its support for NITF.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Falls for Third Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures tumbled Tuesday for a third consecutive  
session on the New York Mercantile Exchange as another large sale 
of the industrial metal reinforced views Russia has begun heavy 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat and soybeans retreated, corn gained and  
coffee retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium fell after investors in London said as much as 120,000  
ounces of the metal had been sold. That comes after Russia on 
Friday sold 160,000 ounces, a move that caused prices to tumble 
nearly 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the largest single producer of palladium, which is  
used in jewelry, electronics and the automobile industry. 
Large-scale shipments had been halted since December, however, amid 
bureaucratic delays that have taken place for three consecutive 
years at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays have forced auto manufacturers in particular to  
scramble for available supplies since many use the metal in the 
manufacture of emission-control devices required under clean-air 
laws in a number of countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for June delivery fell $6.30 to $290 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board  
of Trade, while corn futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell amid continued expectations of an improved  
winter wheat crop and as farmers rushed to get spring wheat into 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures gained on the U.S. Agriculture Department's report  
that plantings remain behind the five-year pace despite drier 
weekend weather. Prices also were supported by the National Weather 
Service's latest 10-day forecast, which predicted more rain for a 
soggy Midwest. That could further delay plantings as the window of 
opportunity begins to close for corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pressured by the knowledge that the planting  
window for soybeans is larger. That could mean any acreage not 
planted to corn is switched to soybeans. Prices also were pressured 
by the continuation of harvesting in South America, although that, 
too, has been slowed by inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.62 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.22 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.18 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York amid expectations a respected crop forecaster this week will 
boost his estimate of total Brazilian production. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Agriculture Department attache Leon Yallouz, who is  
now in private business, was expected to issue a report to his 
clients that revises upward his previous estimate of a 
23.7-million-bag to 25.9-million-bag crop a month before heavy 
harvesting begins, analysts said. Each bag weighs 132 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices have been in the doldrums for weeks on the belief  
that Brazil, the world's largest producer, will harvest a bumper 
crop for the second consecutive year. The supplies are coming in 
after a relatively weak peak coffee consumption period came to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee fell .70 cent to $1.02 a pound, while  
September coffee fell 1.5 cents to $1.028 a pound.

<HEADLINE> Wolves Sign 1998 First-Round Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Radoslav Nesterovic, a 7-foot center who was the  
Minnesota Timberwolves' first round pick in 1998, signed a 
multi-year contract with the club prior to Tuesday night's game 
against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in uniform for the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Nesterovic, a native of Slovenia, recently finished his second  
season with Kinder Bologna, where he averaged 13.5 points and 6.2 
rebounds during the Italian League regular season. The team also 
played in the EuroLeague finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy that he can participate for us for the remainder  
of this season,'' team vice president of basketball operations 
Kevin McHale said. ``We want him to get his feet wet and get 
acclimated to the NBA and the Twin Cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves picked Nesterovic 17th overall last June, even though  
he had a year left on his Italian contract. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Timberwolves hadn't signed Nesterovic by Wednesday, they  
wouldn't have been able to negotiate with him until Aug. 1. That 
would have given other European teams time to make offers, and they 
could pay him more than the three-year, $2.6 million deal he gets 
from the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, the Timberwolves placed forward Bill  
Curley on the injured list with a sprained right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Curley played in 35 games this season and averaged 2.2 points  
and 1.5 rebounds. The Timberwolves also waived rookie center Trevor 
Winter, who appeared in one game this season.

<HEADLINE> FAA Wants Better Flight Recorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is calling  
for faster installation of better flight recorders -- the so-called 
black boxes -- on Boeing 737 commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA proposal announced Monday comes in the wake of a  
National Transportation Safety Board finding that a jam in 
rudder-control valve caused the 1994 crash of USAir Flight 427 near 
Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The newer black boxes can track more flight functions,  
especially related to the rudder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, flight recorders have provided a blueprint for  
deficiencies in the system that needed to be fixed,'' FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said at the NTSB's international 
symposium on flight data recorders that began Monday in Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the FAA also will propose increasing the 30-minute  
recording now required on cockpit voice recorders to two hours and 
installing a 10-minute backup power supply by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal regulators issued a rule ordering all U.S.  
transport airplanes -- not just 737s -- to be equipped with flight 
data recorders that could track a minimum of 17 functions. The FAA 
said the changes had to be made by August 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey said the agency now will propose additional requirements  
for newer 737s. The FAA wants to require these 737s to have flight 
data recorders that can keep information on four to 11 other flight 
functions -- beyond those covered by the 1997 ruling. And they would 
have to be installed by August 2000 -- a year sooner than those 
covered in the earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Frenzel, head of safety and operations for the Air  
Transport Association, which represents major U.S. airlines, said 
the association is somewhat frustrated by the changing mandates 
from the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members have already been upgrading the parameters on the  
flight data recorders based on the previous order,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 500 Days Until Sydney Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The shadow of the Olympic corruption  
scandal fell across the festivities Tuesday as organizers started a 
500-day countdown to the start of the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While officials brought out a giant fake kangaroo on a bicycle  
and a glittering sculpture for auction, one of the key players in 
bringing the games to Sydney was placed under renewed 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board of the International Olympic Committee  
appointed a three-member panel to look at the latest allegations 
against Phil Coles, a former Olympic athlete now accused of abusing 
his IOC position. The panel will report to the full IOC June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was censured after the IOC's votes-for-bribes case in Salt  
Lake City, and is being further investigated for allegedly 
receiving excessive gifts from someone associated with Athens' 
failed 1996 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also was at the center of fresh allegations Tuesday that  
confidential briefing notes from the Sydney bid were given to 
organizers of the successful Salt Lake City team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has stepped aside from the board of the Sydney Organizing  
Committee for the Olympic Games pending an IOC decision, but 
president Michael Knight believes he should already have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position has always been that I think it would be in both  
Phil Coles' interests and Sydney's interests for him to remove 
himself permanently from the SOCOG board,'' Knight said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a function in a shopping mall in central Sydney, Knight  
helped auction the first of 500 numbered sculptures, one of which 
will be sold each day between now and Sept. 15, 2000, when the 
games begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Made of the same steel as the cauldron that will hold the  
Olympic flame during the games and the same silver as the medals, 
the sculpture sold for $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
	With SOCOG still $110 million short of its budget, Knight  
greeted the money as ``26,000 (Australian dollars) we didn't have 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has had to cut its $1.65 billion budget by $48.7 million  
because of sponsor wariness blamed on the IOC scandal, and to pay 
for other contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
	A special committee has been appointed to find the savings.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, games preparations are well advanced.  
</P>
<P>
	The $2.1 billion construction program is 85 percent complete and  
the six more venues expected to be finished by the end of 1999 will 
supply all the promised permanent sporting venues, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute with local residents about closing part of Bondi beach  
for the beach volleyball is yet to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're down to the business end of running the games,'' he  
said. ``We're in good shape but we've got a lot of things to do and 
a fairly short time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complete event-by-event schedule was released this week,

<HEADLINE> First Lady Launches Asthma Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged parents who  
smoke to light up outside the home as she helped launch several 
initiatives to help children fight asthma, a disease that has 
reached epidemic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 14 million to 15 million Americans have asthma but  
many don't realize that their wheezing, coughing and breathing 
problems are caused by it. The disease is the leading cause of 
hospitalization for children and one of the main reasons children 
miss school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to pay particular attention to poor families because  
it is the children of the poor who suffer disproportionately from 
this disease,'' Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday as she kicked off a 
national asthma screening program at an inner-city elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Black children suffer the most from asthma, according to the  
American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Although their 
risk of contracting it is only slightly higher than for other 
children, black children are more than four times more likely to 
die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of children with asthma has doubled to 6 million in  
the last 15 years, said Dr. Talal Nsouli, Washington chairman of 
the ACAAI's screening program. The rate for children under age 5 is 
1.6 times higher than it was 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 schools, shopping malls, community centers and  
health fairs offered free screenings Tuesday as part of the program 
to increase detection of asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton called on Congress to enact a White House proposal  
to help fight asthma. The Department of Health and Human Services 
wants to spend $50 million for state grants that would identify and 
treat poor children served by Medicaid who have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Asthma can be controlled with medication but early detection and  
constant, appropriate treatment are the best ways to prevent asthma 
statistics from increasing further, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also introduced a public service campaign to  
promote a study released by the Environmental Protection Agency 
that says exposure to secondhand smoke considerably worsens asthma 
for up to a million children. It also increases the chances among 
young children that they will contract pneumonia, ear infections, 
bronchitis and sudden infant death syndrome, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton encouraged parents who smoke to avoid doing so  
around their children or in their homes. She said she has 
implemented a nonsmoking policy at the White House, which has led 
to some ``tickly'' situations involving visiting kings, prime 
ministers and other heads of state who tried to light up a 
cigarette inside and were shooed outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that you'll think of your house, the White House, as an  
example perhaps for your own house,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> No Celebration for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- What Palestinians once hoped would  
be their Independence Day began like any other for laborer Abdel 
Kareem Abu Najim: Waiting in the pre-dawn darkness at a dusty 
border crossing for permission to go to his $25-a-day construction 
job in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, the end of a five-year autonomy agreement with Israel,  
was once touted by Yasser Arafat as the day a Palestinian state 
could finally be declared. It became instead a melancholy milestone 
for Palestinians, the latest in a long line of hopes deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Palestinians reacted with shows of defiance -- some clearly  
meant to underscore the threat of violence if the deadlock with 
Israel continues. In the West Bank town of Hebron, masked men fired 
rifles into the air while hundreds of marchers chanted, ``Statehood 
is our right!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of marchers broke away and hurled stones at Israeli  
troops who fired rubber-coated steel pellets in response. Three 
Palestinians and an Israeli TV cameramen were injured. A clash in 
the town of Beitunia left one demonstrator injured. 
</P>
<P>
	But such demonstrations were small and scattered. Throughout the  
Palestinian lands, the overriding sentiment was one of quiet 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like any day -- all I can think about is getting  
work,'' said Abu Najim, a 36-year-old father of six who lives in 
Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp, stepping momentarily out of the long 
line of Palestinian workers passing through the Erez checkpoint 
between the Gaza Strip and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained as an accountant, he works instead as a day laborer and  
was headed Tuesday for a construction site outside Tel Aviv. The 
$20 to $30 he makes there each day is more than he would be paid in 
Gaza -- even if he could find a job, which he cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I leave my house at 3 a.m. ... I'm so exhausted, and I never  
see my children,'' said Abu Najim, rubbing red-rimmed eyes. 
``That's what statehood would mean to me, having a job in my field, 
being able to have time with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few here argue with Arafat's decision to delay a declaration of  
statehood, despite the long-held Palestinian view that they had the 
right to become independent upon Tuesday's expiration of the Oslo 
interim peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a declaration now, in the absence of a negotiated statehood  
agreement with Israel, would likely have brought a sweeping Israeli 
crackdown -- and ignited Israelis' fears over national security, 
thus boosting re-election prospects for hard-line Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in voting only 13 days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with an almost universal sense among Palestinians that  
holding off on statehood was the smart tactical move, seeing the 
day come and go brought a palpable sense of letdown. 
</P>
<P>
	A cartoon in the leading daily newspaper Al-Quds had three  
panels, the first showing a calendar page marked May 3 and the last 
showing May 5. In the middle, where the May 4 Tuesday date would 
normally be, was a page with the notation: ``Forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, perhaps wishing to disassociate himself from the day's  
unhappy associations -- and from any potential unrest -- spent the 
day outside the country, visiting Ireland and Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, Netanyahu claimed it was his unyielding stance  
toward the Palestinians that had staved off a declaration of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the fourth of May and there is no declaration of  
Palestinian statehood,'' the prime minister told reporters. ``It's 
an important achievement for the state of Israel and the government 
of Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Netanyahu government has frozen compliance with the  
U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accords negotiated last September, 
saying the Palestinians have not lived up to their commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister said if he were re-elected, his government  
would work toward a new accord that would ``give the Palestinians 
the freedom to manage their own affairs,'' while safeguarding 
Israel's interests. Netanyahu opposes Palestinian independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the notion that Israel could indefinitely prevent a  
statehood declaration drew derisive laughter from Palestinians in 
the Khan Younis refugee camp, living in some of the worst 
conditions in Gaza. The smell of sewage hangs in the warm air, and 
debris litters the sandy streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there anyone who doesn't want to control their destiny? Who  
could possibly doubt that this will happen?'' said Abdul Hamid, 54, 
who lives with a family of 15 in a small cement-block house with a 
corrugated tin roof. ``We will have our state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Mercy Mosque in Gaza City's old town, the imam, or prayer  
leader, said he kept the day's meaning in mind during Tuesday's 
morning prayers. Only about a dozen worshippers made their way 
through the dawn chill to join in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray that we will have peace and stability in our land,''  
said Mohammed Ali Yussef, white-bearded and dressed in the 
traditional long white robe. ``I think the coming of a Palestinian 
state will bring that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Gaza's Mediterranean shore, a teen-age fisherman said that  
for him, statehood might mean freedom to cast his nets without 
being kept close to the shore by Israeli patrol boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's only a normal day -- no state for us now,'' said Rashid  
Abu Mahdi, his trousers soaked to the knee and held up with twine 
from a fishing net. ''But things will change.''

<HEADLINE> Willey Says Clinton Made Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Former White House volunteer Kathleen  
Willey testified today that President Clinton was ``very forceful'' 
in an unwanted sexual advance near the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hands were all over me,'' Mrs. Willey said, testifying for  
the prosecution in the trial of her former friend, Julie Hiatt 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Recounting her version of an incident she first described to the  
nation in an interview on ``60 Minutes,'' Mrs. Willey, in a soft 
but unwavering voice, said she told the president she desperately 
needed a paid job at the White House because of her family's 
financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then took her to a galley near the oval office and made  
his advance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey said Clinton backed her against a wall and ``tried  
to kiss me. He was very forceful. His hands were all over me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied Mrs. Willey's allegation under oath.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey said Clinton kissed her on the mouth, touched her  
breasts, and put his hands up her dress. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified at the trial of Ms. Steele who is charged with  
lying to investigators to undercut Mrs. Willey's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, prosecutors summoned one of Clinton's lawyers,  
Mitch Ettinger, to describe his visit to Ms. Steele in January 
1998, while he was working on the president's defense in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under sometimes contentious questioning, Ettinger said he sought  
an affidavit from Ms. Steele but never pressured to her to sign it. 
He insisted her affidavit wasn't crucial to the president's 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of Ms. Steele have testified that she told them about  
the alleged incident between Mrs. Willey and Clinton prior to 1997. 
Clinton has denied any such incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele told investigators she first heard the allegation  
against Clinton when Mrs. Willey asked her to lie to back up her 
story to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is charged with obstruction of justice and giving  
false statements, accused of lying to FBI agents and two grand 
juries in Kenneth Starr's investigation of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger said Ms. Steele told him that Mrs. Willey had ``asked  
her to fabricate a story regarding Mr. Clinton and Ms. Willey to 
the effect that Mr. Clinton had improperly made sexual advances 
toward her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers drafted an affidavit saying that, but  
Ms. Steele declined to sign it for a couple of weeks. Ettinger said 
he didn't know of anyone working for the president pressed her to 
sign it. She eventually did. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have argued that Ms. Steele lied to ally herself  
with the president; defense attorneys maintain she is telling the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Highsmith, a witness who said she had been Ms. Steele's  
best friend, said, ``Julie told me she was afraid it was to her 
detriment if she took a position against the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith also testified Monday that she was called  
repeatedly by Ms. Steele last summer, around the time she gave 
grand jury testimony in Starr's investigation that contradicted Ms. 
Steele's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie wanted to know if I had testified. ... She wanted to  
know what the grand jury wanted to know. ... I wanted to avoid that 
conversation,'' but ended up telling her, Mrs. Highsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Highsmith admitted on cross-examination today that she  
had changed her story on a crucial point involving Ms. Steele and 
remembered new information last November that she hadn't recalled 
in her first half-dozen interviews with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new memory was that Ms. Steele told her in November 1997  
that she first heard Mrs. Willey's story about Clinton in 1994, the 
year after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Highsmith said she forgot the details after she ``started a new  
life'' by moving to Colorado and it came back to her after 
refreshing her memory for the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey, who was expected to testify today, says she  
confided the alleged Clinton advance to Ms. Steele hours after it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The discrepancy is one factor that made it impossible for Starr  
to send an impeachment referral on the Willey matter to the House 
last year along with his referral on the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in a soft voice, Mrs. Highsmith testified to the  
federal jury that in September 1996, Mrs. Willey related the 
alleged Clinton advance to her and to Ms. Steele over lunch. Mrs. 
Highsmith said she was shocked, but that there was ``not a big 
reaction'' from Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Steele lawyer Eric Dubelier, Mrs. Highsmith  
admitted that she initially told Starr's investigators that the 
first time she ever spoke to Ms. Steele about Mrs. Willey's 
allegation was in January or February 1998. In that initial FBI 
interview on June 26, 1998, Mrs. Highsmith stated there was no 
discussion at the 1996 luncheon of any alleged sexual advance by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time that was the way I recalled it,'' said Mrs.  
Highsmith. ``That is what I said the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith admitted she called Starr's investigators back  
the next day and said the first time she'd heard of the Willey 
incident was in a November 1997 phone call from Ms. Steele. She 
changed her story again when testifying to Starr's grand jury in 
Alexandria six weeks later.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Oil Co. Mulls Repsol Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The board of Argentina's YPF SA  
energy company will ask an investment bank to review a $13.4 
billion acquisition offer by Spain's Repsol SA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentine oil giant did not specify which bank would be  
tapped for the review, but said Tuesday that YPF board members will 
meet again by May 13 to comment on Repsol's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid announced last Thursday could lead to the latest merger  
in the rapidly consolidating oil industry. A deal would create one 
of the world's 10 biggest oil companies with revenue of more than 
$27 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol offered to pay YPF shareholders $44.78 a share for the 85  
percent of the local energy giant it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting Monday, YPF's board received formal notification of  
the Repsol tender, saying details would be relayed to shareholders. 
Repsol chairman Alfonso Cortina, who was elected last month to 
YPF's 12-member board, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol's all-cash offer runs from May 24 through June 23 and is  
conditioned on Repsol obtaining a majority ownership of YPF. If the 
deal between the two former state-owned oil companies goes through, 
Repsol said it hopes to achieve double-digit earnings growth 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be a powerful Latin American rival to  
the state oil companies of Venezuela and Brazil. While the bid was 
uninvited, Repsol officials declined to describe it as hostile, 
expressing hope the YPF board would recommend the offer to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Repsol acquired 14.99 percent of YPF from the  
Argentine government for $2.01 billion. The Spanish company has 
strengths in crude oil refining and marketing of final products. 
</P>
<P>
	YPF owns and operates three refineries, and owns 2,253 service  
stations in Argentina. It specializes in oil production and 
exploration. It earned $1.1 billion on revenue of $5.5 billion in 
1998.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julia Roberts plays a superstar actress besieged  
by the press in the upcoming art-imitates-life film ``Notting 
Hill,'' but she says it's not so bad being famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent life. I'm rich. I'm happy. I have a great  
job,'' she told Vanity Fair in the June issue. ``I travel hither 
and yon to fabulous places. I'm surrounded by wonderful, 
interesting people. I live a privileged life -- hugely privileged. 
... It would be absurd to pretend that it's anything different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, 31, a perennial tabloid target, warns moviegoers not to  
read too much into the plot of ``Notting Hill,'' in which she 
co-stars with Hugh Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struggling with playing a person who really only shares  
an occupation and a height and a weight and a status with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is due out May 28. Roberts reunites with ``Pretty  
Woman'' co-star Richard Gere in ``Runaway Bride,'' due out in July.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Officials Warn of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar, his  
state still in mourning over the Columbine High School massacre, 
has urged his counterparts to consider violent acts committed by 
minors both on and off school campuses when developing priorities 
to deal with such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence in schools is only one aspect of a very difficult  
problem we are dealing with,'' Salazar said Monday while heading a 
panel of officials from Colorado addressing a two-day school and 
youth violence conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, hosted by the National Conference of Attorneys  
General, ends today. Attorneys general from more than 20 states 
attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing top officials nationwide for youth violence like that  
that took the lives of 15 people in Littleton, Colo., last month 
was the focus of discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six weeks ago I would have said that this is the last place in  
America that school violence like this could happen. But I am here 
to tell you that it can happen everywhere,'' said Dave Thomas, 
district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Littleton, Colo. is in a white-collar, middle-class  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has everything you would think that you would need to  
prevent school violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went into Columbine High  
School on April 20 and executed 12 students and one teacher before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Eid, chief legal counsel to Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, said  
better relations among politicians can result in better programs to 
detect youth and school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because if times get tough you're going to need one another,''  
Eid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Zavaras, Colorado's public safety director, urged the  
attorneys general to get their law enforcement agencies, community 
leaders and policy-makers together for possible violence in their 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do any of you think this will be the last time this happens?''  
he asked. ``Because I sure don't.''

<HEADLINE> Parents Eager About Kids on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet may hold extraordinary promise  
for children, but their parents also carry deep fears about its 
possible influence, says a new survey released today about kids and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found this incredible conflict,'' said Joseph Turow, who  
wrote the report for the Annenberg Public Policy Center. ``People 
trust their kids with the Internet, but they don't trust the 
Internet with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, being released today in Washington, suggest  
a Jekyll-and-Hyde view by parents of the Internet, where graphic 
sexual photos are merely mouse-clicks away from children's Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is there,'' agreed Darlene Maloney, president of  
the Indiana Parent Teachers Association. ``You read about all the 
garbage that happened to this one and that one, and they're 
fearful. They're learning it can be your friend as well as your 
enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Mrs. Maloney's six children still live at home and use  
the Internet regularly, in part to send e-mail to their grown 
siblings who live in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study divides parents into three groups based on their  
reactions to specific statements about the Internet, such as, ``My 
children's exposure to the Internet might interfere with the values 
and beliefs I want to teach them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow said 39 percent of parents can be described as ``online  
worriers,'' who are convinced of both the happy and scary elements 
of the Internet and most concerned about the impact of the Web on 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The same percentage of parents are ``gung ho'' about the  
Internet, enthusiastic about the Web and rejecting nearly all 
statements about its alleged negative effects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turow described other parents as ``disenchanted,'' not at all  
convinced about the Internet's value for children. Just over half 
these parents agree that the Internet can help kids with their 
homework, and only 28 percent agreed with the statement, ``The 
Internet can help my children learn about diversity and 
tolerance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Montgomery, who heads the Center for Media Education in  
Washington, said some parents believe their children are more 
expert than they are at using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often they're more familiar than parents are. We're struggling  
as parents to keep up with them,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``We're dealing with a very new medium in its  
earliest, formative stages, and we have an opportunity to help 
shape it. We don't have to be frightened, passive grownups worried 
about what it's going to do to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow said the study -- and others like it -- are important in  
gauging the future of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the threshold of a whole new cultural experience,''  
he said. ``This is not going to go away. This is going to become 
the fabric of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on a telephone poll of 1,102 parents in  
homes with at least one working computer and at least one child 
between the ages of 8 and 17. The interviews were conducted between 
Nov. 12 and Dec. 20 and carried a margin of error of plus or minus 
3 percentage points.

	AT&AMP;T To Acquire MediaOne for $54B  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and Comcast Corp. reached a deal  
tonight, paving the way for AT&AMP;T's $54 billion acquisition of 
MediaOne Group Inc. Under the agreement, the two companies will 
exchange various cable systems, resulting in the net addition of 
750,000 subscribers for Comcast, the nation's No. 3 cable company. 
Because Comcast is obtaining more subscribers, it will pay AT&AMP;T up 
to $3.5 billion. The majority of the exchanges are subject to the 
completion of the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne merger.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is considering ordering the  
return of two captured Serb soldiers to Yugoslavia after the 
release of three U.S. POWs, a White House aide said tonight. Senior 
administration officials were reviewing the idea as Clinton heads 
to Europe to get an update from NATO commanders on the airstrikes 
and meet with American troops. One of the Serb soldiers was turned 
over to U.S. military officials in Albania in mid-April after his 
capture by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The second came 
into U.S. custody last week, according to Pentagon officials. The 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who secured the release of the U.S. soldiers, 
met with Clinton yesterday and asked him to consider releasing the 
Yugoslav soldiers.

	Poll: Bush Holds Big Lead Over Gore  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has taken a strong lead over  
Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire in the race for the Republican 
presidential nomination, and retains a big advantage nationally, 
according to two polls released today. On the Democratic side, Vice 
President Al Gore has expanded his lead over Bill Bradley, 
according to a national poll of Democrats by CNN-USA Today-Gallup. 
Gore had 66 percent in the poll, while Bradley had 23 percent. In 
mid-April, Bradley trailed Gore 54 percent to 34 percent. Bush 
leads Gore in a theoretical match by 56 percent to 40 percent, in 
the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, about the same lead Bush has held 
over Gore since February.

	Twister Raked Ground for Miles  
</P>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- The biggest twister to tear through  
Oklahoma was a monster unlike most any other tornado, cutting a 
path one mile wide and tearing up miles of countryside. Multiple 
tornadoes slammed Oklahoma and Kansas yesterday, killing at least 
43 people. Dr. Fred Carr, director of the University of Oklahoma 
School of Meteorology, said most tornadoes measure 500 to 600 feet 
wide and reach the ground briefly, skipping across the landscape. 
The biggest of yesterday's tornadoes was classified F-5 -- the 
highest on the Fujita scale, which measures storm severity -- 
meaning it had winds in excess of 260 mph. That was a whopper even 
for the heart of a region used to twisters.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
blasted into space tonight, eight months after the inaugural flight 
ended in a midair explosion. But it quickly ran into trouble. The 
second stage used to boost the Orion communication satellite into a 
higher orbit ignited properly the first time, but apparently did 
not fire as long as it should have the second time around. If the 
information is correct, the satellite could be in too low of an 
orbit. The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the Pacific for 
Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high perch.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The nation's major Internet companies  
have agreed to offer parents faster access to technology allowing 
them to control and monitor children's online habits, Vice 
President Al Gore said today. Gore called the agreement ``a 
positive step forward'' that could keep youngsters away from 
``inappropriate content'' like violent game sites or hate group 
sites. Under the agreement, officials have developed an Internet 
site containing a series of resources, including a ``guide to good 
content,'' and safety tips for youngsters and parents.

Pittsburgh and sent New Jersey to another early playoff exit, 
leading the Penguins to a 4-2 win over the Devils in Game 7 of 
their opening-round series tonight. Jagr had two assists in the 
deciding game and helped set up another goal in a three-goal second 
period by Pittsburgh, which won despite managing only 13 shots. 
Martin Straka had a goal and two assists, and German Titov, Alexei 
Kovalev and Jan Hrdina added goals to advance the eighth-seeded 
Penguins to the second round against fourth-seeded Toronto in what 
is now a wide-open Eastern Conference.

<HEADLINE> Breyer: America Cynical About Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans may be too apathetic or cynical  
about their government to bother carrying on the democratic 
decision-making the Constitution envisioned, according to Supreme 
Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about indifference and cynicism because indifference  
means nonparticipation and cynicism means a withdrawal of trust,'' 
Breyer said in a speech prepared for delivery to a Law Day luncheon 
of the Tulsa, Okla., Bar Association today. 
</P>
<P>
	An advance text of his speech was made available by his office.  
</P>
<P>
	``It does not bother me when I read that the public is less  
aware of the names of Supreme Court justices than of the Three 
Stooges,'' Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it does bother me when I read that more teen-agers can  
name the Three Stooges than can name the three branches of the 
federal government; or that three times as many know that '90210' 
stands for Beverly Hills than that 'the birthplace of the 
Constitution' stands for Philadelphia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer also cited statistics indicating that although 80 percent  
of Americans in 1964 said they trusted the government, only 35 
percent say so today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution, Breyer said, ``creates a method for making  
decisions; it then leaves decision-making to the democracy that it 
creates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For this reason, too, the Constitution not only foresees  
participation by the public, it demands that participation,'' he 
said. ``For without trust and participation, the Constitution 
cannot work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer, 60, joined the nation's highest court in August of 1994  
and remains its most junior justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I confess to a few butterflies in my stomach the first year or  
two,'' Breyer said. ``Indeed, I keep thinking of a New Yorker 
cartoon. ... A circus dog is about to set out, very gingerly, upon 
a tightrope while a clown below unfolds a scroll. It says: 'All Rex 
could think about when he stepped out upon the high wire was that 
he was a very old dog and this was a brand-new trick.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The passage of time, Breyer said, has made him less anxious.  
``It has given me more experience interpreting the Constitution ... 
enabled me to try to develop consistent approaches to its various 
parts and begin better to understand the document as an integrated 
whole.''

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Circulation Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Daily newspaper circulation declined 0.5 percent  
in the six-month period ending in March, continuing a long-term 
trend that the newspaper industry is hoping to reverse. Sunday 
circulation fell by 1.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger newspapers reported slight gains in circulation, but  
smaller ones continued to struggle with declines, according to data 
released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 papers with circulations over half a million reported  
a gain of 0.02 percent over the same six-month period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Large papers reporting circulation increases included USA Today,  
The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, 
Newsday and the Daily News of New York. The Chicago Tribune 
reported gains in its Wednesday, Thursday and Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller papers generally reported declines. According to an  
analysis of the Audit Bureau's data by the Newspaper Association of 
America, the 30 papers with circulations between 250,000 and 
500,000 posted a decline of 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67 papers between 100,000 and 250,000 daily circulation  
declined 0.1 percent, and the 111 papers between 50,000 and 100,000 
declined by 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the long-term decline in newspaper readership,  
which has nagged the industry for years, the Newspaper Association 
has launched an effort to boost readership at a time when consumers 
face more and more choices for getting news from cable TV and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the NAA's campaign was officially launched  
last week at the group's annual convention under the guidance of 
Sergio Zyman, a former marketing executive for Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on the figures, NAA president and CEO John F. Sturm  
said: ``The newspaper industry is strong financially. Now, we 
recognize both the need and the opportunity to invest our resources 
in growing readership.''

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Prostate Cancer Relapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third of men whose cancerous prostates are  
removed will have blood tests suggesting the cancer is returning. 
But it can be years before any new tumors appear, and doctors have 
been unable to say for sure who needed aggressive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, scientists report that it can take a median of eight  
years between that first worrisome ``PSA test'' following prostate 
removal and development of metastatic prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And the longer it takes for that abnormal PSA test to arise  
after surgery, the longer men will survive, Johns Hopkins 
University researchers report in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``provides evidence that a rising PSA level after a  
surgery is not a death warrant for all patients,'' said Dr. Howard 
Scher of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgically removing the prostate often cures prostate cancer.  
But the cancer sometimes returns in other parts of the body. This 
metastatic disease is incurable; once men relapse, median survival 
is five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Men with no prostates have no PSA, or prostate-specific antigen,  
in their blood -- unless some prostate cancer cells escaped and are 
roaming in their bodies, too. So the first sign of trouble is a 
positive PSA test. But until now, nobody knew which of these men 
would relapse fastest. Nor is there any good treatment to stave off 
relapse. So men were left frightened and confused. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mario Eisenberger's study of 1,997 surgery patients provides  
the first way to calculate these men's cancer risk. How soon after 
surgery PSA was detected, how fast it rose and whether initial 
prostate tumors were high- or low-grade determined survival time. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a 75-year-old man whose initial tumor was low-grade  
and whose PSA didn't return until four years after surgery probably 
won't relapse for more than 10 years, Eisenberger said. He may not 
choose any treatment -- after all, healthy men that age have only a 
10-year life expectancy anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	But men with high-grade tumors whose PSA rises within two years  
of surgery are at risk for relapsing within eight years and might 
want treatment, especially if they're younger. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is part of a special cancer edition of the American  
Medical Association's journal. Among other findings: 
</P>
<P>
	--Just 43 percent of family members at very high risk of an  
inherited form of colon cancer agreed to be tested for the 
dangerous genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutations in certain genes carry an 85 percent risk of this  
cancer, called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Those who 
know they're at risk can get special tests to detect cancer early, 
tests proven to increase life expectancy by about seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Georgetown University's study of 208 members of four  
cancer-prone families found more than half refused genetic testing. 
Those with symptoms of depression were four times more likely to 
refuse; the less-educated also often refused. By highlighting the 
causes of refusal, the researchers hope doctors can better target 
genetic testing. After all, the news can be good: 58 percent of 
those tested learned they were free of the dangerous genes. 
</P>
<P>
	--DNA tests to detect a common viral infection are highly  
effective at uncovering early cervical cancer in women whose Pap 
smears are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Pap smears can detect the first signs of cervical cancer, often  
in time to cure. But some 2 million women annually have abnormal 
Pap results in which doctors can't tell whether cancer is present. 
Those women usually get repeat Paps. 
</P>
<P>
	But human papillomavirus, or HPV, causes most cervical cancer,  
so Kaiser Permanente researchers studied 995 women with abnormal 
Paps. Testing for HPV infection proved 89 percent accurate in 
pinpointing who was likely to have cancer -- and thus needed an 
immediate biopsy -- while repeat Pap tests were 76 percent accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	A regular Pap smear won't yield enough cells for laboratories to  
do HPV testing without the woman returning to her doctor. To speed 
results and decrease patient anxiety, the researchers recommended a 
new type of Pap smear called ThinPrep that collects enough cells 
for both Pap and HPV testing at once.

<HEADLINE>  Tornadoes Kill Dozens in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The death toll reached 45 today after  
fierce tornadoes destroyed entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and 
Kansas. One monstrous twister chewed across miles of Tornado Alley 
for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in  
Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined death toll makes this the deadliest tornado  
outbreak since 90 people were killed on May 31, 1985, in Ohio, 
Pennsylvania and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest twister formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma  
City and cut a path at least a half-mile wide. While many tornadoes 
are short-lived, this one stayed on the ground for about four 
hours, said Wayne Ruff, a National Weather Service meteorologist. 
Local TV stations followed it with live broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage ``looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine  
stories tall, it's spread out over a large area,'' Oklahoma City 
assistant fire chief Jon Hansen said, referring to the federal 
building bombing in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More severe thunderstorms with scattered twisters rippled across  
the Plains this morning, and tornado warnings were posted for parts 
of central Oklahoma. A tornado watch covered much of the rest of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton declared 11 Oklahoma counties  
disaster areas and promised a similar declaration for parts of 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 miles north of Oklahoma City, a tornado spawned by the  
same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses 
and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kan., and its suburb of 
Haysville. Hospitals treated more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is worse than what you can see,'' said Bob Thompson, a fire  
battalion chief in Sedgwick County, Kan. He said more deaths were 
possible, and dogs were used today to search the rubble of homes in 
Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in  
Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his 
companions were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris said. ``We all rolled in it. It  
was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, the dead included 11 people in Bridge Creek, about  
30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman 
for the state Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Others died in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore, Del  
City and Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really just getting started on the foot-by-foot  
search,'' Clayton Taylor, a Red Cross spokesman, said today in 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have whole communities that simply aren't there anymore,''  
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told NBC's ``Today'' show. ``It 
certainly looks like a huge battle has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of houses destroyed in the Oklahoma City area  
approached 2,000. Cars were tossed about and crushed. Natural gas 
spewed from ruptured lines. Utility poles were splintered into 
kindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in the Oklahoma City metro area treated 563 people for  
tornado-related injuries, police Capt. Charles Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the war in Germany. I've had bombs fall all  
around me. Now I've been in a tornado,'' 73-year-old Anna Knerr 
said today in a shelter in Midwest City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Knerr said she and her husband hid in a closet before the  
storm hit. ``Then there just was this creepy feeling,'' she said. 
``The next thing I know I was covered. The roof just collapsed on 
me.'' She and her husband crawled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman said the tornado  
may have been a mile wide at times. The weather service's David 
Andra predicted the twister would be categorized at least an F4, 
the second-strongest tornado classification, defined as a storm 
with wind at 207 to 260 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It would probably be late today before the staff at the  
laboratory could determine just how strong the tornado was, 
researcher Harold Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system also spawned twisters in north and west Texas, but  
did no major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
	The main tornado in Oklahoma formed near Chickasha, about 45  
miles southwest of the capital. It plowed across the flat 
countryside, toppling trees, power lines, buildings and cars until 
it ripped into south Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service issued its first tornado warning at  
4:49 p.m. Monday as twisters started over rural parts of the state. 
Television stations started live coverage a few minutes later, 
following the storms with cameras and radar for about two hours 
before the tornadoes slammed into the Oklahoma City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, tornadoes killed 42 people around Kissimmee, Fla., on  
Feb. 22-23, and 34 people died in the area of Birmingham, Ala., on 
April 8.

<HEADLINE> IOC Ruling Body Clears Kim Un-Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The case against the  
highest-ranking Olympic official implicated in the Salt Lake 
scandal was dropped today, while IOC leadership said it needed more 
time to investigate the case against a member from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Kim Un-Yong, an executive board member from South Korea,  
and Phil Coles, a leader of Sydney's organization for the 2000 
Summer Games in Sydney, already had received severe warnings for 
their roles in the corruption case, the worst in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate decision, International Olympic Committee  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said that 80 people -- just over 
half of them IOC members -- would be involved with a new reform 
panel, almost four times the number originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was established in March, the commission, IOC 2000, was  
supposed to have 20-24 members to help the committee rebuild from 
the scandal, in which 10 IOC members resigned or were kicked out. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Keba Mbaye said information the IOC had  
requested in Kim's case led the leadership to decide ``no new 
element at present justifies going beyond the severe warning'' 
issued in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, one of the IOC's inner circle who once had hopes of  
succeeding Samaranch, had faced expulsion if it was proved he knew 
that the Salt Lake Olympic bidders helped pay for his son's salary 
at a telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbaye said that he and two other senior members -- Anita DeFrantz  
of the United States and Switzerland's Marc Hodler -- would carry 
out further investigations into Coles and report back by the IOC's 
June session in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, a former Olympic canoeist, is one of the IOC's most  
popular members. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cited for accepting travel and accommodation perks from  
Salt Lake City, and was under renewed scrutiny since his ex-wife 
claimed that representatives of Athens' unsuccessful bid for the 
1996 Olympics gave the couple jewelry worth $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He has consistently denied the claims and refused to resign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it'll be wrapped very quickly for everyone's sake,  
including Phil Coles','' said Kevan Gosper executive board member 
from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he spoke to Coles early today and would do so again  
Wednesday morning at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence emerged today when Australian media said that Salt  
Lake City had obtained confidential briefing notes by Coles on how 
other IOC members could be trusted to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	All the allegations will be subject to ``a single investigation  
and a single decision,'' Mbaye said. Gosper said he was concerned 
about ``how these files ended up in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Broadcasting Corp. also said it was clear that  
Australian diplomats were working for the Sydney bid, adding that 
Salt Lake City's Olympic committee had received nearly 400 pages of 
the confidential files of Sydney's bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for diplomatic or government support to be  
given to a candidature,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to comment on what fate might await Coles,  
but said the case had ``nothing to do'' with Sydney's efforts to 
organize the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, we have no facts,'' he said. ``We have to act with  
facts, not with information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mandate of the IOC 2000 panel is to study the restructuring  
of the IOC, including how members are appointed, age and term 
limits, and changes to the host city selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will hold its first meeting in Lausanne June 1 and  
2, Samaranch said. It will be supervised by its own 26-member 
executive board -- with 13 of those members from outside the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the membership had become so large ``because we  
consider that we need many, many opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its ruling body includes former Secretary of State Henry  
Kissinger; 1984 Los Angeles Games organizer Peter Ueberroth; U.S. 
Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl; Italian industrialist 
Giovanni Agnelli, and former U.N. Secretary-general Boutros Boutros 
Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger panel contains 26 present and former Olympic  
athletes, 10 of whom competed in the Atlanta and Nagano games. 
Among them are Ukrainian pole vaulter Sergei Bubka, Czech javelin 
thrower Jan Zelezny and Canadian track star Charmaine Crooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them are 44 IOC members, 12 current or former presidents  
of international sports federations -- including FIFA President Sepp 
Blatter -- and 24 current or former presidents of national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress have harshly criticized the IOC and  
threatened to impose sanctions unless the committee adopts certain 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and other IOC officials have responded by accusing the  
United States of ``political interference.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles, Baltimore Cops Get Lessons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles learned a thing or two  
about baseball from a Cuban team that brought the proper attitude 
into a game of historic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore police, meanwhile, got a lesson in crowd control  
from the second-base umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles were humiliated by a feisty team of Cuban all-stars  
Monday night, falling 12-6 in the first game held in the United 
States between a Cuban team and a major league club. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory has great meaning, not just for me but for all  
the players and all the Cuban people,'' third baseman Omar Linares 
said. ``We just tied the series between the Orioles and Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans treated the game with reverence. Baltimore wanted the  
day off. 
</P>
<P>
	By the third inning, the Orioles trailed 6-3 and were pretty  
much done for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they wanted it much more than we did. They showed a  
lot of energy, and my hat's off to them,'' Baltimore manager Ray 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans ran around the bases at a dizzying pace, but arguably  
the biggest burst of energy was displayed by second-base umpire 
Cesar Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
	Three protesters ran onto the field in the middle of the fourth  
inning and were eventually run down by Baltimore police and charged 
with trespassing. A fourth ran onto the field in the top of the 
fifth carrying a sign that read ``Freedom -- Strike out against 
Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valdez body-slammed the man to the ground and began punching him  
until Baltimore outfielder B.J. Surhoff separated the two. At that 
point, police finally stepped in and ushered the man off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, I am Cuban,'' Valdez said. ``I just thought it was  
the right way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, it was. No one else ran onto the field after that,  
but the incidents were almost as embarrassing to the hosts as the 
lopsided final score. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't affect us at all, this lack of respect by the  
spectators,'' Linares said. ``The ones who should worry about this 
are the organizers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests marred a night in which the Orioles made a  
concentrated effort to be exemplary hosts to the Cubans. The team 
served Cuban-style food and drink at the concession stands, played 
Latin music over the public address system before the game and gave 
the Cuban contingent excellent seats behind the visitor's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hosts couldn't control a few unruly fans -- or the  
weather, which was damp and chilly. 
</P>
<P>
	It was drizzling when Baltimore's Scott Kamieniecki threw the  
first pitch, and the game was delayed by rain for 56 minutes in the 
bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles thrilled the sellout crowd of 47,940 with two runs  
in the first inning, but the Cubans quickly took over and gained a 
split in the historic two-game series that began in Havana on March 
28. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were excited about their win. That's how they play,''  
Surhoff said. ``I've played against them in international events 
and they're usually older teams playing against younger kids. It's 
not the way we play, but that's what they do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a no-win situation for us. If we won, we were supposed  
to win,'' Surhoff said. ``If we lost, we didn't play so well. We 
just didn't play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the third inning, the home fans were booing their  
high-priced, last-place team. The Cuban fans, however, were having 
a grand old time. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Orioles' mascot spelled out O-R-I-O-L-E-S for the fans  
in center field, several fans rooting for the visitors retaliated 
by spelling out C-U-B-A over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the game, the winners walked to the center of the  
field carrying two Cuban flags. They exchanged handshakes between 
themselves and then cheerfully shook hands with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the day we have been waiting for,'' Linares said.  
``We hope to have many like it in coming years as well.''

<HEADLINE> Pancho Villa, Wells Fargo Had Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa stole  
122 bars of silver from a Wells Fargo Express train in 1913, then 
secretly struck a deal to sell most of the loot back to the 
original owners, according to newly discovered documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The money turned him from a bandit and minor revolutionary into  
a military threat to both Mexico and the United States, said 
University of California library curator Walter Brem. 
</P>
<P>
	After the robbery, Villa found it impossible to sell the silver,  
so he arranged to sell it back to Wells Fargo's customers for 
$50,000 in cash, Brem said. The silver was worth about $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Villa had only a few men under his command. The  
cash, which would be worth $831,000 today, allowed him to assemble 
his powerful ``Division of the North,'' Brem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villa agreed not to steal any more Wells Fargo property, and the  
shipping company decided to keep the buyback and Villa's role in 
the robbery secret, according to Brem. He said he suspects the 
company didn't go public with the deal so that it wouldn't be seen 
as aiding a revolutionary and so others wouldn't copy Villa. 
</P>
<P>
	Brem said Villa ultimately returned only 93 of the silver bars,  
claiming others were stolen by his men. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents were letters written about the holdup by employees  
of Wells Fargo Express, contained in a collection of corporate 
history papers from a regional Wells Fargo office that were given 
to the university in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real find,'' Brem said. ``It's a real smoking gun.  
It documents an event that historians have treated warily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fredrich Katz, a University of Chicago professor and author of  
``The Life and Times of Pancho Villa,'' agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was well known that he held up the train and later bought  
arms and ammunition,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``But 
Wells Fargo's role was not known. That is new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the bank's historian, Bob Chandler, said there had been no  
coverup, despite statements by Wells Fargo Express workers in the 
letters that they had ``been careful not to compromise the company 
in any way. Chandler said the shipping company had merely arranged 
meetings between Villa and the owners of the purloined silver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wells was just acting as a go-between. It's not a question of  
covering it up; we were just the agent,'' said Chandler, who also 
noted that the bank had no role in the affair, since the shipping 
company was a separate entity at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Villa, who helped lead a series of rebellions against the  
Mexican government, stole the bars from a Wells Fargo train in 
Chihuahua, Mexico, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Brem said a letter from the Wells Fargo shipping subsidiary in  
El Paso, Texas, details Villa's attack, during which Villa and 25 
of his 200 rebels boarded the train. The army reportedly killed one 
man who possessed enemy military orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``They also took one of the passengers off the train and killed  
him in a most cruel way, torturing and mutilating him horribly,'' 
one letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villa continued to lead his rebel army until reaching a truce  
with the government in 1920. He was assassinated in 1923.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Celtic Lewis' Death Is Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Six years after Boston Celtics captain Reggie  
Lewis dropped dead shooting baskets, his widow is in court fighting 
for his reputation -- and the millions he could have made had he 
lived past 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis' malpractice suit, which began Monday before  
a jury, pits her husband's reputation against those of some of the 
city's most respected physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis contends the doctors misdiagnosed and mistreated  
her husband's fatal heart arrhythmia. The doctors say Lewis used 
cocaine and lied about it, making an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was to continue today.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the proper treatment had been given, Reggie Lewis would be  
here today,'' plaintiff attorney Robert Harley said. ``In all 
likelihood, (he) would be playing for the Celtics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis' suit names Dr. Gilbert Mudge, who led the  
specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, who were 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis is suing to recover money Lewis would have made had  
he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 million to more 
than $100 million. Her attorneys contend Lewis could have continued 
playing by wearing a defibrillator or taking medication, or could 
have held other positions like broadcaster or product pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dailey Jr., Mudge's attorney, said in his opening  
statement that Lewis lied to doctors about cocaine use until two 
weeks before he died, and the lack of full disclosure early in the 
treatment process made a proper diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the same as if I went in with a stomachache and  
never told my doctor I'd eaten a two-week-old meat loaf,'' Dailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has adamantly denied her husband ever used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	But Dailey said there was strong motivation to lie: Lewis'  
three-year, $9 million contract, which would have been nullified by 
illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``A disclosure that cocaine was being used would place that  
money in huge jeopardy,'' Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mudge finally was told of the possible cocaine use, he told  
Lewis he should be checked out further, but Lewis died before that 
was arranged, Dailey said. He added that Lewis also refused to 
follow the doctor's orders to stay away from certain physical 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Harley said claims of drug use, besides being false,  
are immaterial to the case. The doctors, Harley said, were 
responsible for providing the best care, regardless of the cause of 
the heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main participants in the case would comment 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	It began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a playoff  
game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New England 
Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed him 
with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concluded he did not have a normal heart,'' said Dr. Gerald  
Miley, one of the doctors who examined Lewis and the first witness 
to testify in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed there was a strong probability his life was at  
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists -- Mudge, of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis died while shooting hoops in the  
offseason at Brandeis University in Waltham, leaving a pregnant 
wife and thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a virus that could have caused inflammation of the 
heart, scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that had become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no conclusive evidence of cocaine, which could have been an 
alternative explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Miley, who testified Monday, said he did not test Lewis for  
cocaine because he had no reason to doubt the All-Star when he 
denied he used the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd known him for several years,'' said Miley, an internist at  
New England Baptist Hospital who performed preseason physicals for 
the Celtics. ``I had no reason not to believe him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 7-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, has said she tried, unsuccessfully, to 
get evidence of drug use excluded because the charges only 
``sensationalize and hide the true issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie, and how his life could have been saved,'' 
Harris-Lewis said Monday. ``When this is over, I hope and pray 
justice will finally be done.''

<HEADLINE> Julia Roberts Enjoys Stardom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julia Roberts plays a superstar actress besieged  
by the press in the upcoming art-imitates-life film ``Notting 
Hill,'' but she says it's not so bad being famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent life. I'm rich. I'm happy. I have a great  
job,'' she told Vanity Fair in the June issue. ``I travel hither 
and yon to fabulous places. I'm surrounded by wonderful, 
interesting people. I live a privileged life -- hugely privileged. 
... It would be absurd to pretend that it's anything different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, 31, a perennial tabloid target, warns moviegoers not to  
read too much into the plot of ``Notting Hill,'' in which she 
co-stars with Hugh Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struggling with playing a person who really only shares  
an occupation and a height and a weight and a status with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is due out May 28. Roberts reunites with ``Pretty  
Woman'' co-star Richard Gere in ``Runaway Bride,'' due out in July.

<HEADLINE> Sharks' Postseason Goes In the Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Left wing Jeff Friesen knows why his San  
Jose Sharks failed to get past the opening round of the Stanley Cup 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're too slow and not strong enough to make any progress. To  
move ahead, we have to be ready,'' Friesen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks got off to a dismal start this season, winless in  
their first eight games. Still, they rebounded to make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was of little comfort as the Sharks once again failed  
to have a .500 season. San Jose has never reached the milestone as 
a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our team to finish over .500 next year. We're so close  
to getting there. All it will take is a little more work,'' Friesen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks started the season 0-6-2, but went 26-19-11 in their  
last 56 games to claim a seventh-place finish in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of their recovery, they had to go on the longest  
uninterrupted road trip in NHL history, a grueling 10 games that 
sent them to Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, 
Florida, Detroit, Buffalo and Washington in February. They emerged 
4-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks were 31-33-18 at the end of the regular season. The  
team set franchise records for fewest goals allowed at 191, with a 
team goals-against average of 2.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Damphousse, who came to the Sharks at the trading  
deadline from Montreal, speculated that the start cost the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a better team now than at the start of the season,''  
he said. ``We had a slow start and I think that hurt us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some on the team blamed the start on a tiring season-opening  
road trip to Tokyo, where they went 0-1-1 against Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks did their best to make up for it. Friesen led the  
team with 22 goals and 35 assists in the regular season. Right wing 
Alex Korolyuk, who was called up from the Kentucky Thoroughblades 
on Dec. 11, had 12 goals and 18 assists with the Sharks and was 
named the team's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran goalie Mike Vernon and backup Steve Shields also proved  
competent. Together, they combined for a franchise-record eight 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields was especially effective down the stretch, going 9-0-2  
with three shutouts from March 9 to April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	One oddity of the Sharks' season was the saga of defenseman  
Andrei Zyuzin, who abruptly fired his agent on March 19 and went 
AWOL from the team for 12 games. During his absence, he was 
represented by Vitaly Shevchenko, who was not recognized as an 
agent by the NHL player's union. Zyuzin eventually rehired his 
previous agent and returned to the Sharks without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end -- just like last year -- a stronger playoff opponent  
sent the Sharks on their summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche beat them 3-2 in overtime Monday to wrap  
up the first-round series at 4-2. Last season, the Sharks fell to 
the Dallas Stars 4-2 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley was gracious in complimenting the  
Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans in San Jose can be real proud of their hockey club,''  
Hartley said. ``It looks good for the future and they are very 
exciting to play against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks defenseman Jeff Norton agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This team is going places,'' he said. ``We're taking shape. We  
can go places, we're just turning things our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it will be up to the Sharks to make sure of that, Friesen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This offseason we need to work on getting stronger and faster.  
We have to work on that,'' he said. ``Our team has to get bigger 
and faster.''

	It took nearly five months for the five PGA Tours of the world

of the 2001 Match Play Championship. That may turn out to be the 
easy part. 
</P>
<P>
	The real challenge will be persuading the top Americans to show  
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think I'm going to go? I mean, really,'' David Duval said  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the top 64 players in the world for the inaugural Match  
Play Championship at La Costa Resort in Southern California was no 
problem. The lone holdout was Jumbo Ozaki, who rarely leaves Japan 
and would be on the Senior Tour if he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting them to Australia the first week of 2001 is another  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	While $1 million in official money awaits the player who can win  
six matches in five days, a mere $25,000 is there for the 32 
players who don't get past the first round. Most can easily make 
that much at a one-day corporate outing in their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
	And as La Costa proved, even the best players in the world  
aren't guaranteed more than one round when it comes to match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see myself going to Australia and potentially playing  
one round of golf -- two, counting practice rounds,'' said Mark 
Calcavecchia, himself a first-round loser in February. ``As that 
type of event goes all over the planet, eventually I think you'll 
see less and less players from the top 64, because of the potential 
one-and-out factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a $5 million purse, the World Golf Championships will never  
be confused for the Quad Cities Classic or the Qatar Masters. In 
terms of prestige, they should be one notch below The Players 
Championship and the four majors, and well ahead of everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is no guarantee the WGC will completely fulfill the  
mission of bringing together the best players in the world -- at 
least not all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The eligibility for Match Play is the top 64 players available  
from the world ranking. If Duval or anyone else decides not to go, 
that's good news for the players ranked 65th and down. 
</P>
<P>
	But should Americans bail out en masse whenever a WGC event is  
staged somewhere beyond their shores, their message will be clear -- 
a world tour is a great idea, as long as we don't have to go all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	And that message will reek of the spoiled Americans syndrome.  
</P>
<P>
	Shigeki Maruyama came to the Match Play from Japan. Stephen  
Leaney traveled from Australia. Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood 
spent more time on the plane from Britain than they did between the 
ropes at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	Why should Americans balk at playing in someone else's back  
yard? 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just Australia, which is still too far down the  
road for Duval or anyone else to make a concrete commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Already there are rumblings that not everyone who is eligible  
for the Stroke Play Championship in November will go straight from 
the Tour Championship in Houston to the southern coast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, there are valid reasons for wanting to skip Australia.  
The 2001 Match Play will start Jan. 3, the first tournament of the 
year after a two-month break from official events. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it takes two days to get there and two days to recover,  
that means leaving home right after Christmas, spending New Year's 
Eve in another hemisphere and playing for a $5 million purse with a 
game that may be more suited for a shotgun scramble that early in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Lee Westwood of England is having second thoughts about  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all about the money, is it?'' he said. ``You want to  
win majors, and those are in the middle of the year. You need time 
off, and that time off is January for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it were about the money, Duval considered the prospect  
of 40 hours in the air for a possible $25,000 and couldn't make it 
add up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They take 40 percent out for the country tax. Now you're at  
$15,000,'' Duval said. ``Two airline tickets are $20,000, so now 
you're $5,000 in the hole. It wrecks the week before and the week 
after, so it's really like a three-week trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to tell you I'm going for sure.''  
</P>
<P>
	Eight non-PGA Tour members checked out in the first round at La  
Costa, and six of nine Europeans were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're at a disadvantage here,'' Craig Stadler  
said after his win over Montgomerie. ``They got beat. And they've 
got a long flight home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is it too much for Americans to take that same risk?

<HEADLINE> Roenick Returns To Coyotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- All-Star center Jeremy Roenick returned to the  
Phoenix Coyotes' first line and special teams Tuesday night for 
Game 7 of their playoff series against the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick warmed up without a helmet, but then donned his helmet  
and a new, hinged mask to protect his broken jaw, shattered 20 days 
earlier by an elbow from Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Oral surgeon Reed Day said the recovery was possible in that  
amount of time because of several factors, including the strong 
constitution of the 29-year-old Roenick, the Coyotes' leading 
scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Day also implanted titanium plates to hold Roenick's jaw  
together rather than wiring them in place. That allowed Roenick to 
take in enough food to avoid losing weight and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentist Rick Lawson also fitted Roenick with an extra-soft  
mouthguard. The NHL had to approve his protective faceguard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeremy is a very bright and articulate young man who knows  
exactly what he's doing and is well aware of the risks,'' Day said, 
adding that he had no misgivings. He said if Roenick broke his jaw 
again, it could be repaired again. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, who had 24 goals and a team-high 48 assists before his  
injury on April 14, tried out the protective gear by taking blows 
from ``sticks and fists and elbows'' under Day's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick's right thumb also was broken when Craig Ludwig of the  
Stars slashed him a split second before Hatcher crushed him into 
the boards. Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said the prognosis 
for that injury to heal was 2-4 weeks, and said he expected no 
problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was suspended for two games of the regular season and  
five playoff games because of the elbow and the retaliation factor, 
hitting Roenick the next time the teams played after Roenick 
knocked out Mike Modano of the Stars on March 23 with a hard check 
behind the net. That hit was unpenalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars swept Edmonton in the first round, so Hatcher must sit  
out Game 1 of the second round.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Not Worried About Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The president of the European Central Bank  
said Tuesday he wasn't worried about the weakness of the new euro 
currency against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg refused to comment, however, on whether the bank  
would consider intervening if the euro's decline continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no concerns,'' he told reporters before a conference  
on the 75th anniversary of the National Bank of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal's central bank president Antonio de Sousa said the bank  
was not happy with the weakened euro, the currency of 11 European 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should clearly stress that we don't want a weakened euro,''  
de Sousa said. But he added that intervention in the foreign 
exchange market can't solve structural problems that could be 
weakening the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro this week was trading in London about 9.6 percent below  
its level when launched Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> How Tornadoes Are Ranked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists rank a tornado's intensity and estimate its wind  
speed based on observed damage, using a scale developed by the late 
University of Chicago researcher Tetsuya Theodore Fujita: 
</P>
<P>
	-- F0: Gale tornado. Wind speed: 40-72 mph. Damage: Some damage  
to chimneys; breaks branches off trees; pushes over shallow-rooted 
trees; damages signs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F1: Moderate tornado. Wind speed: 73-112 mph. Damage: Peels  
roof coverings; mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned; 
moving autos pushed off the roads; attached garages may be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F2: Significant tornado. Wind speed: 113-157 mph. Damage:  
Considerable damage. Roofs torn off frame houses; mobile homes 
demolished; boxcars pushed over; large trees snapped or uprooted; 
light objects become missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F3: Severe tornado. Wind speed: 158-206 mph. Damage: Roof and  
some walls torn off well-constructed houses; trains overturned; 
most trees in forests uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F4: Devastating tornado. Wind speed: 207-260 mph. Damage:  
Well-constructed houses leveled; structures with weak foundations 
blown off some distance; cars thrown; large missiles generated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F5: Incredible tornado. Wind speed: 261-318 mph. Damage:  
Strong frame houses lifted off foundations and carried considerable 
distances; automobile-size missiles fly through the air for more 
than 100 meters; trees debarked; steel-reinforced concrete 
structures badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, only one F5 tornado hits the United States each  
year. F5 twisters struck in 1998 in Waynesboro, Tenn., and Pleasant 
Grove, Ala.; in 1997 in Jarrell, Texas; in 1996 in Oakfield, Wis.; 
in 1992 in Chandler, Minn.; and in 1990 in Plainfield, Ill., 
Goessel, Kan., and Hesston, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the worst U.S. tornadoes on record, seven F5s struck  
the Midwest on April 3, 1974, including at Xenia, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F6: Although he called it ``inconceivable,'' Fujita left open  
the possibility a tornado could cause a small area of damage even 
worse than F5 intensity. But he said evidence of an F6 tornado -- 
with wind speed up to 379 mph -- would probably be masked by damage 
from surrounding F4 and F5 winds.

<HEADLINE> Racists Convicted of Murderous Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two white supremacists accused of  
plotting to set up a whites-only republic in the Pacific Northwest 
were convicted Tuesday of murder, conspiracy and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe and Daniel Lee, both 26, could get the death  
penalty or life in prison without parole for killing an Arkansas 
gun dealer, his wife and her daughter in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will return Thursday to begin hearing testimony in the  
sentencing phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said the men pursued their dream of an  
all-white republic by stockpiling military-style weapons, robbing 
several people and suffocating gun dealer William Mueller, his wife 
and her 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aryan Peoples Republic was to have been perpetuated through  
polygamy, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conspiracy count charged that Kehoe and Lee also carried out  
crimes in other states, including two killings in Idaho and the 
1996 bombing of City Hall in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense lawyers say that while Kehoe and Lee may have had  
offensive beliefs, they did not act criminally on them or have the 
means to do what prosecutors claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie and brother Cheyne Kehoe first entered the public eye in  
1997, following a videotaped shootout with police in Ohio. Cheyne 
Kehoe later helped authorities find his brother.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybean Futures Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures and soybean futures retreated  
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell amid continued expectations of an improved  
winter wheat crop and as farmers rushed to get spring wheat into 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures gained on the U.S. Agriculture Department's report  
that plantings remain behind the five-year pace despite drier 
weekend weather. Prices also were supported by the National Weather 
Service's latest 10-day forecast, which predicted more rain for a 
soggy Midwest. That could further delay plantings as the window of 
opportunity begins to close for corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pressured by the knowledge that the planting  
window for soybeans is larger. That could mean any acreage not 
planted to corn is switched to soybeans. Prices also were pressured 
by the continuation of harvesting in South America, although that, 
too, has been slowed by inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.62 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.22 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.18 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .25 cent to 62.47 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .17 cent to 71 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .57 cent to 58 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.22 
cents to 57.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Ridding Sprouts of Harmful Bacteria / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Crunchy, nutritious sprouts seem like the  
ultimate health food -- often piled on salads or layered in veggie 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sprout industry has been devastated in the past few  
years by concerns over the unhealthy pathogens that sprouts can 
carry. A recent medical study estimated more than 20,000 people 
were sickened in three salmonella outbreaks linked to alfalfa 
sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a task force of researchers, including some from the  
University of Georgia, is trying to find ways to rid sprouts of 
pathogens and reinstate consumer confidence in the food. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we've just thrown up our hands and said, 'Take  
your chances.' We don't feel that way. We feel the health of our 
consumer is the most important priority,'' said Nancy Snider, 
president of the International Sprout Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider said about 475 sprout growers are located across the  
United States. Sprout growing was a $250 million industry in 1998, 
but Snider estimates it will be down to $200 million this year 
because of decreased consumer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts-based sprout growers association is a member  
of the task force, along with researchers from the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, Illinois Institute of Technology, the University 
of Georgia and the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force wants to reduce the amount of pathogens like  
salmonella and E. coli that sprout seeds can carry by more than 
99.99 percent, said Dr. Charles Sizer, director of the National 
Center for Food Safety and Technology at IIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Task force members are working on four different ways to  
accomplish that goal -- by heating the seeds in water in a process 
similar to pasteurization, by using a disinfecting chemical like 
hydrogen peroxide and with two different methods of irradiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is the seeds are fairly delicate. We're in a  
balancing act, trying to get as much kill as we can and still 
retain the germination of the seeds,'' Sizer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Slade, an assistant professor at IIT and the task  
force coordinator, said irradiation looks promising. The process 
involves using low-level doses of gamma rays or electron beam 
irradiation to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	And researchers are optimistic about a test on growing water  
before the sprouts would be harvested. If the water tested positive 
for a bacterium like salmonella, the sprouts would be discarded, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force hopes to have some solutions in another six  
months, but in the meantime, growers can used a chlorination 
process approved by the FDA to decontaminate seeds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Contamination comes from several sources. About half the alfalfa  
seeds used by growers come from foreign suppliers, whose growing 
safeguards might not be as strict as in the United States, said 
Slade. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds can become contaminated in the field by feces from a  
salmonella-infected animal or waste water. The way sprouts are 
produced -- with lots of water -- also encourages the spread of 
pathogens, as does the fact that bacteria love the same nutrients 
that make sprouts nutritious for humans, he said.

<HEADLINE> California Executes Manuel Babbitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- A Vietnam veteran who received a  
Purple Heart on death row was executed by injection early Tuesday 
for beating a 78-year-old woman to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Babbitt died at 12:37 a.m. PDT, a day after his 50th  
birthday, after all his court appeals were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt was sentenced to death for killing Leah Schendel in  
1980. He was convicted of breaking into her Sacramento apartment 
and hammering her with punches that broke her dentures and split 
the skin on her forehead to the bone. Her frail heart gave out 
under the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said he didn't remember what happened that night, or the  
following evening when he attacked another woman, breaking off when 
a friend rushed to her aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Marine was turned in to police by his brother, Bill,  
whose suspicions were aroused after he found items stolen in the 
Schendel slaying in Manuel Babbitt's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Babbitt and other family members deplore what Babbitt did  
but they don't believe he was in his right mind when he did it. 
They say he was flashing back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders said Babbitt, troubled by mental disease since his  
youth, cracked under the pressure of 77 days of shelling, misery 
and death in the siege of Khe Sanh. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt received a Purple Heart in prison for wounds suffered  
during that siege. The rare death row ceremony infuriated Mrs. 
Schendel's family, which demanded -- and got -- legislation banning 
another such presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt was the seventh man executed since California resumed  
executions in 1992.

Baltimore for a baseball game has requested asylum, Baltimore 
police said Tuesday. Police said Rigoberto Herrera walked into a 
Baltimore Police Department office at 10 a.m. EDT today to make the 
request. Baltimore police contacted the Immigration Naturalization

	Crews Search for More Storm Victims

<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Rescue crews picked their way past  
snapped-off trees and smashed cars today in a search for more 
victims of powerful tornadoes that killed at least 36 people in 
Oklahoma and Kansas. Oklahoma's medical examiner's office said an 
earlier higher death toll was an estimate, but one official said he 
was ``fairly certain that number will go up.'' Hundreds of law 
enforcement personnel were dispatched to the damaged areas. It was 
the nation's deadliest outbreak of tornadoes since 1985, when 
storms killed 90 people in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario. 
President Clinton has declared 11 counties in Oklahoma disaster 
areas. 

</P>
<P>
	Federal Aid for Tornado Victims

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal emergency and Red Cross workers are on

tornadoes in Kansas and Oklahoma. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency will coordinate the work of 27 federal agencies and the Red 
Cross. The Red Cross has set up 10 emergency shelters in Oklahoma 
and three in Kansas. It has also sent a dozen emergency response 
vehicles to provide food for tornado victims in the two states.

	Clinton To Address Consumer Privacy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing legislation to

information-sharing among banks, insurance companies and securities 
firms. The proposals include requiring financial institutions to 
inform consumers of plans to share or sell their personal financial 
information, and giving consumers the power to stop such a 
transfer; restricting any sharing of medical information within a 
financial conglomerate, and requiring credit-card offers of low 
rates to disclose prominently when those rates expire.

commercials, is urging Internet brokerages to better warn their 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Explaining clearly to customers ... would go a long way toward  
reducing the complaints pouring into the SEC, Congress and firms,'' 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To every online firm, I challenge you to meaningfully  
communicate with your customers,'' Levitt said in a speech at the 
National Press Club. ``Talk in realistic terms; let them know their 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an SEC review of online brokerage account agreements  
found that ``almost none'' of them discuss trading risks or what 
customers should do if there is a computer system outage. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC chief also said online firms need to ensure they have  
adequate computer system capacity to handle the swarms of new 
customers, asserting that the brokers have a legal obligation to 
provide efficient execution of trading orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he's not convinced the market watchdog agency needs  
a new set of regulations for online investing, but he did not rule 
out that possibility in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized advertisements by some Internet brokers which  
he said more closely resemble commercials for the playing the 
lottery by promising quick riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's bull market there may be an increasing population  
of tow-truck drivers who now own their own islands as a result of 
online investing. ... (But) I'm worried these commercials step over 
the line and border on irresponsibility,'' he said, referring to 
one widely aired ad campaign on television, Levitt said, 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's remarks come as the SEC and the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, a self-policing brokers' group, have been 
investigating online brokerages nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to looking for violations of securities laws, the  
investigators are examining how well firms execute orders and warn 
customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said SEC auditors already have inspected online firms  
representing 80 percent of the electronic-trading market. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say that by year's end, 10 million amateur investors  
will be trading at least occasionally over the Internet, and online 
customers will account for about a quarter of all retail stock 
trades. The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab, 
E-Trade Group, Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect and Discover 
Brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also expressed concern about that rising popularity of  
day trading, a practice in which investors scope out fast-moving 
stocks, buying and selling them quickly to profit from the sudden 
price swings. Many day-trading companies sell training courses and 
special software to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing day-trading opportunities is not itself against the  
law, but these firms should be on notice that they ... must operate 
within the existing rules,'' Levitt said. He added that firms 
should ensure that their day-trading strategies are suitable for 
customers' financial circumstances and trading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galvin, Massachusetts' secretary of state, announced  
Monday a settlement with All-Tech Investment Group in which the big 
day-trading firm agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse 
customers $228,000. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the  
settlement, but agreed not to sign up any new customers in the 
state for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of day-trading firms acknowledge that the strategy is  
not right for everyone, but contend state regulators are unfairly 
tarnishing the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have 
misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You may have seen the TV ad: A guy's car has

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Rocket Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
blasted into space Tuesday night, eight months after the inaugural 
flight ended in a midair explosion. But it quickly ran into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage used to boost the Orion communication satellite  
into a higher orbit ignited properly the first time, but apparently 
did not fire as long as it should have the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all the information we have for right now,'' the launch  
commentator said before going off the air an hour into the flight. 
``It's preliminary at this time, and we believe we will have 
further details for you later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the information is correct, the satellite could be in too low  
of an orbit. The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the 
Pacific for Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high 
perch. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the third time in less than a month that a satellite  
has ended up in the wrong orbit. The two other satellites were 
launched aboard the Air Force's Titan IV rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday night's  
launch. Not only did it mark the Delta III's return to flight, it 
was the fifth launch attempt in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way down to zero, but  
the rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the error and aimed for a 
Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to make sure 
there were no similarities between the Delta III and the Titan IV, 
which launched a military communication satellite into an orbit 
thousands of miles too low last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more nervous than I normally am,'' Boeing mission director  
Rich Murphy said Tuesday afternoon. ``The whole industry is having 
its problems at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff. The rocket used up all 
of its hydraulic fluid for steering and broke apart when it 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's debut ended up being a $225 million disaster and  
cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Looks To Raise More Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,  
saying his ability to garner money will make him a more viable 
candidate for the presidency, picked up $1 million in his first 
fund-raiser Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we continue to raise money at the rate we're starting with,  
I have no doubt that I'll be one of two or three candidates able to 
raise enough money to compete for first place in all of the early 
primaries,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The former governor, university president and education  
secretary made the remarks to reporters before the fund-raising 
dinner at the Opryland hotel here -- the first of 26 such events on 
his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said his strong support for and identification with  
education is what sets him apart from his Republican competitors 
for the party's presidential nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our party to be strong on taxes, I want us to be strong  
on defense, but at the top of my list is having the best schools 
and helping parents be at their best,'' he said. ``I believe I 
carry that message more effectively to the country and in debates 
with (Vice President) Albert Gore than any of the other 
Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander remains undaunted by his failed effort three years ago  
to win the GOP nomination then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Presidents Bush, Nixon and Reagan, I've run before and no  
one on the Republican side, since Eisenhower, has made it all the 
way to the top the first time they've run,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed a recent CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showing him  
ranked seventh in popularity among possible GOP presidential 
contenders, characterizing them as pre-season results. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important thing for voters is putting the right person  
in office, he said, especially considering the U.S. military 
strikes against Yugoslavia and the Littleton, Colo., school 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what's happened in the Balkans and what's happened in  
Littleton reminds us that the question before the voters will not 
be who's the most famous, who can raise the most money, it will be 
who's ready to be president,'' Alexander said.

<HEADLINE> Study Predicts Cancer Relapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some men who undergo surgery for prostate  
cancer have blood tests signaling they'll eventually relapse -- but 
until now, no one knew how long they'd survive or which patients 
needed aggressive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study, released Tuesday, identifies men at highest risk  
and shows those frightening test results don't always mean imminent 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients may live for years without having the cancer  
spread,'' Dr. Mario Eisenberger of Johns Hopkins University 
explained. ``We hope our (study) will help physicians and patients 
make a more sensible decision on whether they need treatment at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His study was published in a special cancer edition of the  
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The journal also highlighted significant news for women: When a  
Pap smear cannot tell a woman's true risk of cervical cancer, a 
simple new test for a cancer-causing virus can accurately determine 
which women need treatment -- and which do not need to worry about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of prostate cancer, surgically removing the  
walnut-sized gland often is a cure. But the cancer sometimes 
returns in other parts of the body. This metastatic disease is 
incurable; once men relapse, median survival is five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first warning sign is a blood test that detects  
prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. Men with no prostates have no 
PSA unless some prostate cancer cells are still roaming their 
bodies. But PSA can be detected years before new tumors actually 
appear. Until now, doctors didn't know what to tell these 
frightened men. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenberger's study of 1,997 surgery patients found it can take  
years between that first worrisome PSA test and cancer's return. 
Doctors can determine patient survival based on how soon PSA 
appeared after surgery, how fast PSA levels rose and whether 
initial prostate tumors were high-grade or low-grade. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a 75-year-old man whose initial tumor was low-grade  
and whose PSA didn't return until four years after surgery probably 
won't relapse for more than 10 years. He may choose not to be 
treated -- healthy men that age have only a 10-year life expectancy 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	But men with high-grade tumors whose PSA rises within two years  
of surgery are at risk for relapsing in less than eight years, and 
might want treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A complication: There is no good therapy. Suppressing  
testosterone, the main choice, can cause significant side effects. 
But Eisenberger said that if those who relapse quickly enter 
studies of experimental new therapies, scientists may learn faster 
which ones work. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Kaiser Permanente researchers said testing for the  
virus that causes most cervical cancer is important for women whose 
Pap smears aren't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Pap smears detect the earliest signs of cervical cancer. But  
some 2 million women annually have unclear results, where doctors 
can't tell if they're getting cancer or not. Those women can either 
get a surgical biopsy, or wait an anxious six months for a repeat 
Pap. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kaiser's study of 1,000 such women, testing for human  
papillomavirus, or HPV, proved 89 percent accurate in pinpointing 
women with precancerous cervical cells -- while repeat Pap tests 
were just 76 percent accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	A regular Pap smear won't yield enough cells for the extra HPV  
test. So the researchers recommended using a new type of Pap smear 
called ThinPrep that collects enough cells for both Pap and HPV 
testing at once. 
</P>
<P>
	But many insurance companies don't cover ThinPrep, which costs  
about $15 more than a regular Pap. Plus, Digene Corp.'s HPV test 
costs $35 to $50. Although the Kaiser study called HPV testing 
cost-effective, Kaiser said it would determine coverage on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Tuesday's journal:  
</P>
<P>
	--A Harvard-led study showed prostate cancer patients with low  
PSA levels have the best chance of being cured by radiation. The 
study offers the first guidelines for choosing the best 
radiation-therapy candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Georgetown University offered genetic testing to 208 members of  
families prone to a type of inherited colon cancer -- those who 
carried the high-risk genes then would know to get regular cancer 
checks proven to prolong life. But just 43 percent agreed to gene 
testing. People most likely to refuse had symptoms of depression 
and were less educated.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Breaks Homerless Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark McGwire broke his homerless streak with a  
flourish Tuesday night, hitting a second-inning grand slam against 
Atlanta's Greg Maddux that sparked two bench-clearing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis slugger, who had not homered since April 18, came  
up with the bases loaded and two outs after the Cardinals already 
had two runs against Maddux, the Braves' four-time Cy Young winner. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from Maddux into Atlanta's right-field  
bullpen for his sixth homer of the season. That gave the Cardinals 
a 6-0 lead and broke a streak of 41 at-bats without a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who had never before given up six runs in an inning,  
lasted only 4 1-3 innings. He allowed 12 hits and eight runs -- 
equaling the most runs he's surrendered in a game during his 
brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pitches after the homer, he plunked Ray Lankford on the  
shoulder, prompting both benches to empty. No punches were thrown, 
but home-plate umpire Larry Poncino warned the teams to avoid 
further trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on the first pitch in the bottom of the second, Cardinals  
starter and ex-Brave Kent Mercker threw behind Andruw Jones. 
Mercker was ejected and both dugouts emptied again, though the 
teams managed to avoid fisticuffs for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to a record-breaking 70 last year, McGwire's sixth  
homer came during a three-homer performance on April 14 -- St. 
Louis' 13th game of the season. He needed 25 games to hit No. 6 
this year, going the last 13 games without one. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire already eclipsed his longest homerless streak of 1998,  
when he twice went 29 at-bats without going deep. He wound up with 
an average of one homer every 7.3 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 12th grand slam of McGwire's career, the last coming  
on June 12 at Arizona. He went 3-for-5 in the game before being 
replaced by a pinch-runner in the eighth inning with the Cardinals 
leading 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has allowed only one other regular-season grand slam  
since coming up to the big leagues 13 years ago -- a base-clearing 
drive by Philadelphia's Benito Santiago on May 3, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Weren't Into Cuba This Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- In retrospect, the Baltimore Orioles would have  
been far better off saying farewell to the Cuban baseball team 
after their exhibition game in Havana five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch Monday night was a disaster for the Orioles from  
start to finish. Worse, the consequences of the embarrassing loss 
didn't end with the final pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles never really wanted to play Cuba in the middle of  
the regular season, and their indifference was evident early in the 
one-sided affair. After a rain delay of nearly an hour and a 
four-run second inning that put Cuba comfortably ahead, Baltimore 
went through the motions in a humbling 12-6 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't a real great way to spend a day,'' said left  
fielder B.J. Surhoff, essentially summing up the feeling of 
virtually everyone in the organization except perhaps owner Peter 
Angelos, who strived for three years to make the home-and-home 
series a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game in Havana on March 28 was different, in part  
because the Orioles had yet to start their season. Baltimore used 
its third starter, Scott Erickson, and managed to pull off a 3-2 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch, however, came in the middle of a 12-game homestand  
and robbed the Orioles of one of only two off days in May. Orioles 
manager Ray Miller rested all his starting pitchers and went with 
Scott Kamieniecki, who was on the disabled list and admitted after 
the game, ``I just wasn't into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki didn't get past the second inning, so Miller had to  
reach into his bullpen early and often. He used both his long 
relievers, Doug Linton and Ricky Bones, leaving him short for 
Tuesday night's game against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be OK with eight or 10 Tylenol,'' Linton quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore trailed by nine runs before Delino DeShields hit a  
three-run homer in the ninth, but that did little to ease the 
humiliation of losing to a team whose collective salary isn't much 
more than what Baltimore's Albert Belle carries in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, by the way, went 0-for-3 and was 0-for-8 in the two  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was one of several Orioles who experienced futility  
against the Cubans. First baseman Calvin Pickering made three 
errors in the rematch and reliever Gabe Molina gave up five runs in 
one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game went off without a hitch, but the game at Camden  
Yards was marred by four people running onto the field. The last 
was slammed to the ground by second base umpire Cesar Valdes, who 
is Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as yesterday, I'm just going to forget about that,''  
Miller said. ``Five-and-a-half hours of baseball and wrestling 
matches is a bit much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Orioles turned their attention to the White Sox, the  
Cubans celebrated a wonderful victory at home. But Baltimore police 
said Rigoberto Herrera, a coach who accompanied the team to the 
United States, asked for asylum Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lopsided loss, the affect it had on the team and the  
defection, Linton said the second game was a worthwhile event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a step in the right direction,'' he said, ``politically  
and for baseball.''

<HEADLINE> City Council Wants A's Bids Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Less than a week before the deadline for  
choosing the group of investors that will be given the chance to 
buy the Oakland Athletics, city council members complained Tuesday 
they don't have enough information. 
</P>
<P>
	Public officials have until May 11 to select one of two groups  
vying for the right to purchase the A's for $122.4 million, and to 
pass that selection on to major league baseball for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The city council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors  
scheduled meetings this week to hear about the two groups and their 
bids. The city council meeting was Tuesday, with the county 
supervisors scheduled to meet on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors group including former A's executive Andy Dolich,  
Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan and Bob Piccinini, the 
chairman of Modesto-based Save Mart Foods, made a presentation to 
the city council in which Dolich drew applause as he referred to 
the A's past greatness and the glory of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group includes former pitcher Steve Stone, now a  
broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, and former A's coach and New York 
Yankees general manager Bob Watson. That group did not appear at 
Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members demanded more details about the two groups from  
Randy Vataha, the president of the Game Plan consulting firm that 
was hired by public officials to lead the search for prospective 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What concerns me today is I feel like I'm sitting at a pep  
rally and not a city council meeting,'' council member Jane Brunner 
said. ``I cannot make a decision without pieces of paper and a 
commitment. I need detail behind those general statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vataha promised to deliver more information to council members  
before they hold another special meeting Monday, after which they 
are expected to recommend one of the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Vataha also said the new owners would be required to stay at the  
Oakland Coliseum only until the 2004 season, but that the two 
groups were chosen because they have promised a long-term 
commitment to staying in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for the special meeting included Oakland Coliseum  
workers, some wearing A's caps and jackets. Several audience 
members arose to express their support for Dolich's group, saying 
it has deeper Oakland roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignacio de la Fuente, president of the city council, seemed to  
echo those feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sitting in a good position. We have two well-qualified  
groups,'' he said. ``But only one has people that work and live in 
this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other council members, mindful of the legal and financial  
problems that have ensued from the city's deal to bring the NFL's 
Raiders back to Oakland from Los Angeles, were much more cautious 
and said they want more details of the bids. 
</P>
<P>
	If neither of the investor groups buys the A's, current owners  
Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann would retain control of the team and 
have the right to sell or move the A's. San Jose has been mentioned 
as a city possibly interested in seeking the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott and Hofmann worked out a deal last fall that gave public  
officials a chance to sell the team at a predetermined price to a 
group of investors willing to keep the team in Oakland.

<HEADLINE> More Testimony in Starr Probe Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- One of President Clinton's private  
lawyers testified today that he sought an affidavit from Julie 
Hiatt Steele saying that Kathleen Willey asked her to lie to back 
up Mrs. Willey's story of a sexual advance by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second day of Ms. Steele's trial, prosecutors summoned  
Mitch Ettinger to describe his visit to Ms. Steele in January 1998, 
while he was working on the president's defense in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under sometimes contentious questioning, Ettinger said he never  
pressured Ms. Steele to sign the affidavit and insisted it wasn't 
crucial to the president's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of Ms. Steele have testified that she told them about  
the alleged incident between Mrs. Willey and Clinton prior to 1997. 
Clinton has denied any such incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele told investigators she first heard the allegation  
against Clinton when Mrs. Willey asked her to lie to back up her 
story to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, 52, is charged with obstruction of justice and  
giving false statements, accused of lying to FBI agents and two 
grand juries in Kenneth Starr's investigation of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger said Ms. Steele told him that Mrs. Willey had ``asked  
her to fabricate a story regarding Mr. Clinton and Ms. Willey to 
the effect that Mr. Clinton had improperly made sexual advances 
toward her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers drafted an affidavit saying that, but  
Ms. Steele declined to sign it for a couple of weeks. Ettinger said 
he didn't know of anyone working for the president pressed her to 
sign it. She eventually did. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have argued that Ms. Steele lied to ally herself  
with the president; defense attorneys maintain she is telling the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Highsmith, a witness who said she had been Ms. Steele's  
best friend, said, ``Julie told me she was afraid it was to her 
detriment if she took a position against the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith also testified Monday that she was called  
repeatedly by Ms. Steele last summer, around the time she gave 
grand jury testimony in Starr's investigation that contradicted Ms. 
Steele's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie wanted to know if I had testified. ... She wanted to  
know what the grand jury wanted to know. ... I wanted to avoid that 
conversation,'' but ended up telling her, Mrs. Highsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Highsmith admitted on cross-examination today that she  
had changed her story on a crucial point involving Ms. Steele and 
remembered new information last November that she hadn't recalled 
in her first half-dozen interviews with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new memory was that Ms. Steele told her in November 1997  
that she first heard Mrs. Willey's story about Clinton in 1994, the 
year after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Highsmith said she forgot the details after she ``started a new  
life'' by moving to Colorado and it came back to her after 
refreshing her memory for the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey, who was expected to testify today, says she  
confided the alleged Clinton advance to Ms. Steele hours after it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The discrepancy is one factor that made it impossible for Starr  
to send an impeachment referral on the Willey matter to the House 
last year along with his referral on the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in a soft voice, Mrs. Highsmith testified to the  
federal jury that in September 1996, Mrs. Willey related the 
alleged Clinton advance to her and to Ms. Steele over lunch. Mrs. 
Highsmith said she was shocked, but that there was ``not a big 
reaction'' from Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Steele lawyer Eric Dubelier, Mrs. Highsmith  
admitted that she initially told Starr's investigators that the 
first time she ever spoke to Ms. Steele about Mrs. Willey's 
allegation was in January or February 1998. In that initial FBI 
interview on June 26, 1998, Mrs. Highsmith stated there was no 
discussion at the 1996 luncheon of any alleged sexual advance by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time that was the way I recalled it,'' said Mrs.  
Highsmith. ``That is what I said the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Highsmith admitted she called Starr's investigators back  
the next day and said the first time she'd heard of the Willey 
incident was in a November 1997 phone call from Ms. Steele. She 
changed her story again when testifying to Starr's grand jury in 
Alexandria, Va., six weeks later.

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks Offers Music Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The recording industry's effort to stop piracy  
through digital distribution of music just got significantly 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet audio software company RealNetworks announced Monday it  
has created a product designed to make it easier to download and 
play music on a computer. Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc. said in 
a separate announcement that it will market a portable device under 
the RCA brand for playing downloaded music. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will make it easier and quicker for computer users  
to download music from either their own CDs or the Internet onto 
their computer hard drives, said Mark Hardie, a senior analyst with 
Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also help people to find and download the huge number of  
tunes in MP3 and other formats now available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows near-CD quality recordings to be  
transmitted over the Internet, but also has given rise to 
widespread piracy as people trade unauthorized copies of tunes for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will move digital music distribution beyond the  
technically savvy and into the mainstream, said Siddiq Bello, 
publisher of The MP3 Newsletter, a trade publication on Internet 
distribution of music. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Thomson plans this fall to begin selling a $200  
product to play MP3-formatted music downloaded from the computer. 
It will compete with Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.'s Rio, the 
only product now on the market for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	It's disturbing news for the recording industry, which is  
worried the booming trend of people distributing music through the 
Internet will weaken copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will contain an anti-piracy device that limits a  
consumer to making a single copy of a music file for their own use. 
However, consumers will be able to easily disable the device in 
order to send out copies of the music to friends via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is worried that free distribution of music through  
the Internet will cripple the market for selling it, either on CDs 
or online. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Barrett, senior vice president at RealNetworks, said the  
company is ``very respectful of intellectual property.'' But he 
said RealNetworks is responding to an existing demand in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, consumers don't really care about it,'' he said.  
``The reality is most consumers don't want to be pirates and have 
no problem leaving the default in as it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America, which has  
appointed a committee to come up with anti-piracy standards, 
wouldn't comment on RealNetworks' announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want this,'' Bello said. ``The recording industry must  
recognize that fact and make decisions knowing that instead of 
trying to modify that fact.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Chief Urges E-Trade Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's top securities regulator,  
concerned about the booming electronic trading business, today 
urged online brokerage firms to warn their clients of trading 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, made the request in a speech at the National Press 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``To every online firm, I challenge you to meaningfully  
communicate with your customers,'' Levitt said. ``Talk in realistic 
terms; let them know their options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an SEC review of online brokerage account agreements  
found that ``almost none'' of them discuss trading risks or what 
customers should do if there is a computer system outage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Explaining clearly to customers ... would go a long way toward  
reducing the complaints pouring into the SEC, Congress and firms,'' 
Levitt suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC chief also said online firms need to ensure they have  
adequate computer system capacity to handle the flood of new 
customers, asserting that the brokers have a legal obligation to 
provide efficient execution of trading orders. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Levitt expressed concern about some online firms'  
advertisements, saying they more closely resemble commercials for 
the lottery by promising quick riches. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's remarks came as securities regulators investigate  
online brokerage firms and day-trading companies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the SEC and the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, a self-policing brokers' group, has been 
conducted over the past two months or so. The auditors are looking 
for possible violations of securities laws as well as examining how 
well the firms execute customers' orders and warn them of trading 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said SEC auditors already have inspected online firms  
representing 80 percent of the electronic trading market. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say that by year's end, 10 million amateur investors  
will be doing at least occasional trading over the Internet, and 
online customers will account for about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab, E-Trade  
Group, Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect and Discover Brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., is proposing  
increasing the SEC's budget, now at $337.4 million, by $5.5 million 
next year to police against investment fraud over the Internet, a 
Senate aide said today. Gregg is chairman of a Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has asked for an increase of $11 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The world of online day-trading is much smaller than the online  
brokerage business, but also growing fast. Day-traders scope out 
stocks, especially in high-tech companies, solely for sharp price 
swings, buying and selling them quickly to profit from short-term 
movements in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading companies sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galvin, Massachusetts' secretary of state, announced  
Monday a settlement with All-Tech Investment Group Inc. in which 
the big day-trading firm agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse 
customers $228,000. All-Tech neither admitted to nor denied 
wrongdoing in the settlement, but agreed not to sign up any new 
customers in the state for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading firms acknowledge they're not for  
everyone, but they contend state regulators are unfairly tarnishing 
the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have misled 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In related moves Monday, state securities regulators announced  
they have formed a task force to examine online trading issues such 
as advertising and customer order processing. And the Securities 
Industry Association issued a brochure for investors titled 
``Online Investing Tips.'' It is available on the trade group's Web 
site at www.sia.com.
