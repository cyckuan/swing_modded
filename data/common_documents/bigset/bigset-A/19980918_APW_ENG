Thai court imprisons child procurer for 137 years

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's criminal court handed down a
prison term of 137 years to a businessman guilty of procuring the
young for prostitution and pornography, the Bangkok Post reported
Friday.
	   Vivat Jirakasikorn was arrested last May after police raided his
apartment in Bangkok and found a large number of pornographic
pictures.
	   But due to his confession, the court reduced his prison sentence
to 50 years.

World champion expelled from Australian team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion cyclist Lucy
Tyler-Sharman was expelled from the Australian Commonwealth Games
team Friday for criticizing team management.
	   In the latest soap opera style scandal to affect the Australian
cycling team, Tyler-Sharman broke a team agreement not to criticize
other members of the group.
	   She had been due to race for a bronze in the 3,000-meter pursuit
race later Friday but has been banned from competing.
	   Tyler-Sharman, who won the world title in that event at
Bordeaux, France, last month, lost her Commonwealth Games semifinal
Thursday night.
	   She attacked team management, including coach Charlie Walsh, in
a post-race interview and was dragged away from the cameras by
cycling team manager Michael Flynn.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' said Don Stockins, head of the Australian delegation.
	   As a result, he said, he had decided to expel her from the team,
and ``we both agreed that she should leave the (athletes') village
as soon as possible. She will do this today.''
	   Tyler-Sharman fell out with Walsh earlier this year and she
complained in a letter to the Australian Sports Commission in July
about his conduct.
	   ``Nothing has gone to plan since I came here,'' Tyler-Sharman
said after Thursday's race. ``First of all they insisted _ insisted
_ I have a head coach ordering me during the ride who wasn't my
head coach. They informed me of that last night and wouldn't let me
out of it.''
	   Tyler-Sharman also implied her pedals had been sabotaged, a
claim hotly denied by team support staff.
	   ``When I went for my first ride this morning they insisted I
changed my pedals,'' she said. ``Then, bolted in as I was on the
line, they (the pedals) both failed.
	   ``I pulled out of one pedal on the line ... and someone yelled
put your foot back in, so I went, and then I pulled out another
foot in the course of the ride.''
	   Flynn then stepped in and took Tyler-Sharman into a room outside
the track, where they were seen to argue heatedly for several
minutes.
	   All members of Australia's Commonwealth Games team have signed
agreements not to comment on other members.
	   ``Lucy acknowledged that there was a flare-up at the time,''
Stockins said, referring to Tyler-Sharman's outburst. ``She
realized she had made a mistake.''
	   Stockins warned athletes that he would not tolerate such
behavior.
	   ``The athletes need to recognize the agreement, they need to be
aware there are leaders, bosses and decision-makers. ... Their
decisions need to be observed,'' Stockins said.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ President Ernesto Zedillo called the flood
disaster in southern Mexico ``grave, but under control'' and
insisted that his government was rushing aid to hundreds of
thousands affected by last week's floods.
	   The official death toll grew to 162 on Thursday and officials
said they expect it to rise further.
	   Zedillo made his fourth visit to Chiapas state since floods
devastated a Massachusetts-sized along the coast last week, leaving
some 450,000 people homeless.
	   ``Four days ago, the situation was desperate and today it is
under control,'' she president said. ``But the people are suffering
much.''
	   Shortly before Zedillo arrived in Mapastepec, about 55 miles
northwest of here, reporters saw survivors with nothing more than
the clothes on their backs crowd around military helicopters,
trying to flee.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' said Juan Manuel
Villafuerte Figueroa, a small-scale farmer waiting with his wife
and three children.
	   ``We'll look for relatives in other cities _ for now. Later, we
hope the government will help us, even with a few sheets of
corrugated metal to build a roof.''
	   Government officials said 250,000 people will probably have to
relocate from their lowland houses and the government may have to
build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed
by the flooding.
	   While Zedillo ordered all government agencies to cooperate in
aiding the victims, he chided independent aid groups. ``I have not
seen them here,'' he said.
	   The Red Cross and other groups have said they were hindered in
efforts to distribute aid by flooded roads, wrecked bridges, bad
weather and a lack of transport.
	   All 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies _ Mexico's House of
Representatives _ voted Thursday donate a day's pay, equivalent to
about dlrs 160, to help the victims.
	   The Treasury Department also is earmarking dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   Officials said they had made headway in restoring electricity
and repairing roads to the region. Some relief trucks have had to
arrive at the area via Guatemala because all roads through Mexico
were cut.
	   The desperately hungry residents of coastal areas received more
bad news on Thursday: the federal department of fisheries and the
environment warned against eating seafood in some areas due to
contamination caused by dead animals in the rivers.

Mobil announces petrochemical venture with Singapore government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S.-based Mobil Corp. announced Friday it will
enter a joint venture with the Singapore government to construct a
dlrs 800 million petrochemical facility.
	   The venture with the Economic Development Board _ a division of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry _ is for a naphtha-based joint
ethylene cracker facility to be constructed adjacent to the
company's existing refinery complex.
	   The new facility will produce 800,000 metric tons (880,000 short
tons) per year of ethylene and 440,000 metric tons (484,000 short
tons) per year of propylene.
	   The company said in a press release that Mobil Oil Singapore
will have an 80 percent stake in the facility, while the Economic
Development Board would take 20 percent.
	   The statement added that the new facility is not expected to
begin operations before 2003 because prolonged discussions on
agreements with possible customers of the refinery's output are
anticipated, due to Asia's economic slowdown.
	   Mobil added that discussions were under way with potential
customers, which will convert the facility's output into products
such as polyethylene, ethylene glycol, polypropylene, propylene
oxide, styrene monomer, elastomers and phenol.
	   The planned facility will ``provide petrochemicals at a very
competitive cost to Asian markets,'' Mobil Chemical president
Raymond McGowan said in the release.

Thorpe `may be swimmer of century,' coach says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian teen-ager Ian Thorpe's
stunning Commonwealth Games performances left notoriously hard to
please national swim coach Don Talbot gushing.
	   ``What can you say? I don't have a good enough vocabulary to
describe his abilities,'' Talbot said. ``He may be the swimmer of
the century. He's just an incredible boy. When you're talking to
him, when you're watching him, you can't believe he's 15. It's
genetics gone bloody crazy.''
	   While Susie O'Neill finished with six of Australia's 23 gold
medals in the pool, it was Thorpe's performances that raised hopes
of matching the United States at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   He came within .01 seconds of breaking the oldest men's world
record, in the 200-meter freestyle, was a member of the world
record-breaking 4x200-meter team, added the 400-meter freestyle to
his world title and won a fourth gold in the 4x100.
	   ``It's just fabulous. He's a great athlete, he's a cool head, he
handles himself very well, and if he keeps doing that he will be a
very tough boy in 2000,'' said Talbot.
	   Australia demolished its rivals in the pool, leaving just nine
of the 32 golds to England (five) and Canada (four).
	   The country was second on the medal table behind the United
States at this year's world championships and aims to be No. 1 in
its home pool in 2000.
	   But, says, Talbot, there is plenty of work to do.
	   ``If you want to rate us against the rest of the world, it's
five to six out of 10,'' Talbot said. ``If you want to rate us
against the Commonwealth it's a nine and a half.
	   ``We only have seven events that are up in top world class and
there's 32 events so that's only 25 percent,'' Talbot said. ``If we
don't get in the top eight in the world with a year to go in our
events, we have very little chance of winning medals. You can win
them but you want to have a lot of miracles happening.''
	   Australia's team heads home Saturday, and most of the swimmers
will go right into training for the upcoming world shortcourse
championships.

 &UR; RECAPS with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; Mariners beat Athletics 8-0

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 53rd homer, a
three-run shot in the first inning, and Jamie Moyer pitched a
four-hitter as the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 8-0
Thursday.
	   Griffey's homer, his 11th in the last 23 games, was a drive into
the right-field stands that came after Carlos Guillen and Alex
Rodriguez began the game with singles off Tom Candiotti (11-16).
	   On Wednesday night, in a 4-1 win over the A's, Griffey stole a
base to join Willie Mays and Brady Anderson as the only players in
major league history with 50 homers and 20 stolen bases in a
season.
	   The Mariners, who have won four straight, added three runs in
the fourth on RBI singles by Russ Davis and Joe Oliver and an RBI
double by Shane Monahan. Raul Ibanez had RBI singles in the fifth
and ninth.
 &UR; Indians 9, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez hit his 43rd homer to tie the major
league record with six in three games as Cleveland beat Minnesota.
	   He hit three homers Tuesday and two Wednesday before becoming
the seventh player and third American Leaguer to hit six in three
games. His two-run shot in the fourth off Eric Milton (7-13) gave
him six homers in nine at-bats.
	   Ramirez is the first player with six homers in three games since
Philadelphia's Mike Schmidt in 1976. He is the first AL player to
do it since Gus Zernial of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1951.
	   Dave Burba (14-9) allowed one unearned run and four hits in
eight innings.
	   Travis Fryman hit his 27th homer.
 &UR; Yankees 4, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Hideki Irabu allowed just two hits
in eight strong innings and Jorge Posada and Bernie Williams homer
for New York.
	   Irabu (12-9) won for the first time since Aug. 10, stopping his
four-game losing streak. He gave up an infield single to Aaron
Ledesma in the second inning and Randy Winn's bunt single in the
third.
	   Posada hit a two-run homer off Julio Santana (5-5), and Bernie
Williams hit a solo shot off Esteban Yan to pace a 16-hit Yankees
attack.
	   At 105-46, the Yankees need to win six of their last 11 games to
match the 1954 Cleveland Indians' AL record of 111 victories.
 &UR; Red Sox 3, Orioles 2, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Mo Vaughn singled in the go-ahead run in the 10th
and Tom Gordon set a major league single-season record with his
39th straight save as Boston rallied to beat Baltimore.
	   Donnie Sadler went 3-for-4 with a homer for the Red Sox, who
increased their lead over Toronto in the AL wild-card race to five
games.
	   Darren Lewis opened the 10th with a double off Armando Benitez
(5-6), John Valentin was hit by a pitch, and Vaughn singled off
Arthur Rhodes.
	   Gordon got three outs to break the consecutive saves record set
by Joe Mesa in 1995. He has 42 saves in 43 opportunities this
season.
	   Dennis Eckersley (4-1) was the winner.
	   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 43rd homer for Baltimore.
 &UR; Tigers 7, Blue Jays 4 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley hit a three-run homer in Detroit's
four-run ninth inning, stalling Toronto's AL wild-card drive.
	   Easley, who hit a solo homer in the second, drove Robert
Person's pitch off the facing of the second deck in right field.
Easley has 24 homers.
	   Detroit tied it on Juan Encarnacion's sacrifice fly off Person
(3-1).
	   Carlos Delgado hit his 33rd and 34th home runs, and Jose Cruz
also connected for the Blue Jays.
	   Doug Brocail (5-2) was the winner.
 &UR; Royals 13, White Sox 4 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Jose Offerman drove in two runs, stole three bases
and hit his major league-leading 13th triple as Kansas City
overcame Albert Belle's 47th homer to beat Chicago.
	   Johnny Damon hit his 17th homer for the Royals.
	   Tim Belcher (14-12) allowed nine hits and four runs in seven
innings. James Baldwin (11-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Rangers 7, Angels 6
	   In Arlington, Texas, Tom Goodwin doubled in pinch-runner Milt
Cuyler in the eighth inning, completing Texas' 7-6 comeback victory
over Anaheim to put the Rangers atop the AL West standings for the
first time since Aug. 13.
	   The Angels, who had led the division since Aug. 14 and were up
by four games on Aug. 26, finished their road trip 1-6. Both teams
have 10 games remaining.
	   Lee Stevens opened the eighth with a single off the right-field
wall against Pep Harris (3-1), and Cuyler ran for Stevens and
scored from second on Goodwin's double into right-center.
	   John Wetteland capped a game-saving performance by the Texas
bullpen by getting the final three outs for his club-record 41st
save. Tim Crabtree (6-1) threw four hitless innings with four
strikeouts to pick up the win.

Mexico debates postponing Chiapas elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ From Chiapas to Mexico City, government and
independent experts are debating whether a scheduled Oct. 4
election can take place in the southern state of Chiapas, where
thousands of communities are still half-buried in mud.
	   Civic groups are rejecting the position of the Chiapas Electoral
Council, which maintains elections for local and state officials
should be postponed only in the coastal areas hit by last week's
floods.
	   ``The conditions in Chiapas would not allow for elections that
would be truly representative,'' said Francisco Gallardo, a Chiapas
member of the citizen watchdog group Civic Alliance, during a
seminar here Thursday.
	   Even before last week's flooding, which has killed more than 160
people and left nearly half a million homeless, there were some
15,000 refugees who fled their communities to escape from
paramilitary groups, he said.
	   ``How are these people going to vote? The law says they are only
allowed to vote in their home towns,'' Gallardo said.
	   Military activity has grown steadily in Chiapas since a brief
uprising by leftist rebels in 1994.
	   Gallardo said there are over 72,000 soldiers in the state, many
located in areas where support is strong for the Zapatista rebels _
as well as for leftist opposition parties.
	   Congressman Gilberto Lopez y Rivas, member of a congressional
commission trying to encourage a peace treaty in Chiapas, said
elections for local legislators could not be held in seven of the
state's 24 electoral districts.
	   ``How can a state congress be elected when a third of the
population would not be able to vote?, he said.
	   Silvia Gomez Tagle, a professor at the elite Colegio de Mexico
who has studied past elections in Chiapas, said municipalities
along the affected areas were key to the state's political balance,
since many of them are governed by opposition parties.
	   The ruling party, known as the PRI, enjoyed an overwhelming
majority in the state before the 1994 Zapatista uprising.
	   ``The events of 1994 have transformed the political relations in
the state,'' she said.
	   Felipe Calderon, chairman of the conservative National Action
Party, said earlier that his party, which governs the
municipalities of Huixtla and Tonala in the damaged areas, wants
elections held as scheduled in unaffected areas.
	   ``Postponing the elections (throughout the state) would imply
greater costs for the government and the political parties that is
not justifiable,'' he told a news conference.
	   Federal Health Secretary Juan Ramon de la Fuente, who has toured
the disaster area, said elections should be indefinitely postponed
throughout the state.
	   Democratic Revolution Party officials have said they will ask
the Chiapas state congress to postpone the elections to Dec. 4, the
government news agency Notimex reported.

Gunman massacre at least 18 outside popular Mexican resort

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen yanked three families from their
beds, lined them against a wall and shot at least 18 men, women and
children to death near a popular Baja California resort.
	   At least two people were seriously wounded in the attack at dawn
on Thursday. Police have a witness in protective custody, a
15-year-old girl who hid under a bed during the slaughter, The
Associated Press has learned.
	   The attorney general of Baja California state, Marco Antonio de
la Fuente Villarreal, shied away from stating a motive for the
killings during a Thursday afternoon news conference.
	   ``We cannot say 100 percent that it was an aspect of drug
trafficking or for some other motive,'' he said. ``Information is
still lacking.''
	   Earlier in the day, the government news agency Notimex quoted
him as saying the head of one of the households grew marijuana for
the Arellano Felix drug-smuggling gang
	   He reportedly said the man, Fermin Castro, oversaw the Arellano
Felix's marijuana plantations nearby.
	   Castro wasn't killed in the attack, but was in very serious
condition with a bullet wound to the head, health officials said.
	   Police said the attack took place at 4:30 a.m. in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort town of Ensenada, a popular beach destination
for Californians that's only a 1 1/2-hour drive from San Diego.
	   Victoria Salas Arellano, who is not related to the Arellano
Feliz brothers, lives about 100 yards from Castro's ranch. She said
she woke up around 4 a.m. to the sound of gunshots.
	   She said she thought the sounds were noisemakers or firecrackers
from independence day parties the night before until she heard the
ambulances.
	   She described Castro as a well-liked man who participated in
local rodeos and invited poorer neighbors to parties at his ranch
on a hill with a view of the Pacific Ocean .
	   The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up;
most of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all _ and
the beds in at least one of the houses were unmade, as if sleeping
people had been pulled from them.
	   Television images showed the victims lined up in a pool of blood
in front of a wall. A television reporter said one woman was
clutching a baby in her arms; both were dead.
	   ``In all my life, I've never seen anything like this. It looked
like a scene from Rambo,'' said Capt. Humberto Hernandez del Parra
of the Federal Highway Police.
	   Officials distributed a list of 18 confirmed dead, though there
were unconfirmed reports that one to two other people had died
after the attack at hospitals.
	   The director of the Red Cross in Ensenada, Eugenio Carrillo,
said the victims were the residents of three neighboring houses. He
said the dead were nine adults, two teen-agers, six children and a
baby.
	   A 15-year-old girl hid under a bed and escaped notice by the
attackers, and police were questioning her about what she saw, a
judicial police officer told The AP on condition of anonymity. He
did not elaborate and the report could not be confirmed
independently.
	   Children's toys littered the yard outside one house, according
to the television footage. The yard was filled with broken glass
and chairs were overturned on the porch. Turkeys cackled in the
yard.

Two other carriers grounded as government struggles to save

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ While the government tried to broker
a last-minute deal to keep Philippine Airlines in business, two
smaller airlines were grounded Friday in another severe blow to the
country's airline industry.
	   Regulators said they suspended the operating certificate for Air
Philippines, the country's second-largest airline, for failure to
comply with safety standards. Grand International Airways, a
smaller carrier, canceled its flights because of unpaid insurance
and fuel bills, employees said.
	   The shutdowns and the scheduled closure next week of Philippine
Airlines pose a devastating threat to the country, leaving many
areas of the sprawling archipelago of 7,000 islands without air
service.
	   The president of PAL's flight attendants' union, Roberto
Anduiza, called PAL's decision Thursday to close down ``an economic
disaster of national proportions.'' He said the union would be
willing to make sacrifices to prevent a closure.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it decided to shut down next
Wednesday because its rebuilding efforts were no longer viable
following its unions' refusal to accept a management-proposed
rescue plan.
	   President Joseph Estrada met Thursday night with union
officials, who said they will consider his request that PAL workers
be allowed to vote directly on the rescue plan.
	   ``I will try my best to settle this problem,'' Estrada said. ``I
am keeping my fingers crossed.''
	   Estrada said he planned to talk Friday to Lucio Tan, PAL's main
stockholder and chairman, and then meet with union leaders again
Monday.
	   Tan has offered airline employees 20 percent ownership of the
company in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement _ a condition which officials of all three PAL
unions say is unacceptable.
	   ``If you try to take away the soul of the union, we will have to
uphold our principles,'' said Abel Capili, a board member of the
ground workers' union. ``We may have to accept the closure of
PAL.''
	   But a PAL executive held out hope Friday that the airline may
still survive.
	   Asked if PAL has reached the end of its 57-year history,
executive vice president Manolo Aquino replied, ``I hope not.''
	   Aquino said Tan, who holds an estimated 70 percent of PAL's
stock, is hopeful the unions will still accept the
management-proposed rescue.
	   Tan's proposal would give workers three board seats, and each
worker would receive 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos
(about dlrs 6,900).
	   PAL has been devastated by a series of strikes and by Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   It then was crippled by a 22-day pilots' strike in June. It
fired the pilots, cut most of its routes and laid off 5,000 of its
nearly 14,000 workers. But the layoffs triggered a strike by ground
personnel.
	   Aquino said the airline's fate also rests in the hands of its
creditors, to which it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.

President says flood disaster `under control'

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ President Ernesto Zedillo called the flood
disaster in southern Mexico ``grave, but under control'' and
insisted that his government was rushing aid to hundreds of
thousands affected by last week's floods.
	   The official death toll grew to 162 on Thursday and officials
said they expect it to rise further.
	   Zedillo made his fourth visit to Chiapas state since floods
devastated a Belgian-sized along the coast last week, leaving some
450,000 people homeless.
	   ``Four days ago, the situation was desperate and today it is
under control,'' the president said. ``But the people are suffering
a lot.''
	   Shortly before Zedillo arrived in Mapastepec, about 55 miles (88
kilometers) northwest of here, reporters saw survivors with nothing
more than the clothes on their backs crowd around military
helicopters, trying to flee.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' said Juan Manuel
Villafuerte Figueroa, a small-scale farmer waiting with his wife
and three children.
	   ``We'll look for relatives in other cities _ for now. Later, we
hope the government will help us, even with a few sheets of
corrugated metal to build a roof.''
	   Government officials said 250,000 people will probably have to
relocate from their lowland houses and the government may have to
build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed
by the flooding.
	   While Zedillo ordered all government agencies to cooperate in
aiding the victims, he chided independent aid groups. ``I have not
seen them here,'' he said.
	   The Red Cross and other groups have said they were hindered in
efforts to distribute aid by flooded roads, wrecked bridges, bad
weather and a lack of transport.
	   All 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies _ Mexico's House of
Representatives _ voted Thursday to donate a day's pay, equivalent
to about dlrs 160, to help the victims.
	   The Treasury Department also is earmarking dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   Officials said they had made headway in restoring electricity
and repairing roads to the region. Some relief trucks have had to
arrive at the area via Guatemala because all roads through Mexico
were cut.
	   The desperately hungry residents of coastal areas received more
bad news on Thursday: the federal department of fisheries and the
environment warned against eating seafood in some areas due to
contamination caused by dead animals in the rivers.

Mobil announces petrochemical venture with Singapore government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES extraneous word ``joint'' in graf 2

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S.-based Mobil Corp. announced Friday it will
enter a joint venture with the Singapore government to construct a
dlrs 800 million petrochemical facility.
	   The venture with the Economic Development Board _ a division of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry _ is for a naphtha-based
ethylene cracker facility to be constructed adjacent to the
company's existing refinery complex.
	   The new facility will produce 800,000 metric tons (880,000 short
tons) per year of ethylene and 440,000 metric tons (484,000 short
tons) per year of propylene.
	   The company said in a press release that Mobil Oil Singapore
will have an 80 percent stake in the facility, while the Economic
Development Board would take 20 percent.
	   The statement added that the new facility is not expected to
begin operations before 2003 because prolonged discussions on
agreements with possible customers of the refinery's output are
anticipated, due to Asia's economic slowdown.
	   Mobil added that discussions were under way with potential
customers, which will convert the facility's output into products
such as polyethylene, ethylene glycol, polypropylene, propylene
oxide, styrene monomer, elastomers and phenol.
	   The planned facility will ``provide petrochemicals at a very
competitive cost to Asian markets,'' Mobil Chemical president
Raymond McGowan said in the release.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Children's book bunny characters
Flopsy, Mopsy and Peter Cottontail and the rest of the family at
the bottom of the garden had fine pairs of upstanding rabbit ears.
	   Bunny ears that don't stand, but fold in half and flop, or even
stunt and drop off are proving a mystery scientific side-effect
from the introduction of the deadly rabbit calicivirus disease
introduced to kill rabbits in New Zealand.
	   Rabbits, which eat crops and land cover that causes erosion, and
dig burrows that can cause farm animals to stumble and break a leg,
are the biggest introduce pests in Australia and New Zealand.
	   The disease, illegally smuggled in from Australia by
back-country ranchers to combat a rabbit plague a year ago, is
causing excessive cartilage growth in young rabbit's ears, said
Peter Kettle, the Ministry of Agriculture's director of science
policy.
	   The growths, which apparently cut blood supply to parts of the
ear, and cause hair loss and droopiness, have not been reported in
any other country where the disease has been released, he said.
	   ``Unfortunate though it is, there is this unexpected side effect
-- nobody anticipated the ears dropping off,'' he said.
	   Kettle said regional pest control staff had reported the ear
deformities in five different parts of the South Island where the
farmers had released the virus.
	   The ranchers and farmers used mixes of infected rabbit's innards
churned in kitchen blenders to make virus-infected brews which were
sprayed on carrots and used as bait.
	   Research earlier this year confirmed the virus illegally
released by the farmers had been brought from Australia.
	   Dunedin's Invermay animal health laboratory manager Gary Clark
said the deformities included ``folded-down ears, ears with
notches, withering, loss of outer parts, scabs and changes to
cartilage formation.''
	   Kettle said there was no research funding available to further
investigate the ear side-effects of the virus.

Wohlsen fastest in weakened 200 meters

 &UR; Eds: will be updated with finals &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Not to be outdone by Matthew
Shirvington's surprise fourth place in the 100 meters final, fellow
Australian Darryl Wohlsen ran the fastest 200 time in Friday's
Commonwealth Games heats.
	   The field was weakened considerably by the non-appearance of big
stars Ato Boldon, Frankie Fredericks and Obadele Thompson, who were
the medalists in Thursday's 100 with Boldon running a Games record
9.88.
	   That meant the chase for the gold medal in Saturday's 200 final
was be wide open.
	   Running in the first of the eight heats, Wohlsen clocked 20.68
on a track dampened by early morning rain while bigger names, such
as Scotland's European champion Doug Walker and English veteran
John Regis, were around a second slower.
	   Walker, returning to action three weeks after knee surgery,
placed second in his heat to Ghana's Azziz Zakari, who clocked
20.72 to the Scot's 20.77.
	   Regis, a two-time Commonwealth silver medalist and former
European champion, placed second to New Zealand's 100-meter
finalist Chris Donaldson in 20.78. The Kiwi had 20.70 for third
fastest overall.
	   Shirvington, who clocked 10.03 in Thursday's 100 final, won his
heat in 20.96 while the second fastest qualifier was Anninos
Marcoullides of Cyprus, who clocked a heat-winning 20.69.
	   Friday's schedule included the final of the men's 400 meters,
with Welsh stars Iwan Thomas and Jamie Baulch drawn next to each
other.
	   In Thursday's semifinal, the two teammates indulged in a good
humored hand-waving, tongue-pulling, shouting exchange in the final
straight while coasting to a 1-2 finish even though they were two
lanes apart.
	   With England's Mark Richardson likely to be their main rival, it
was unlikely they would repeat it in the final.
	   Other finals included the women's 400, with Sandie Richards of
Jamaica, England's Donna Richardson and Scotland's Alison
Curbishley the main title contenders, and the women's 400 hurdles,
with Andrea Blackett of Barbados the fastest qualifier.
	   England's Judy Oakes has won medals in the women's shot in every
games since 1978, when she won a bronze in Edmonton.
	   She won gold in Brisbane in '82, silvers at Edinburgh '86 and
Auckland '90 and then gold again at Victoria, British Columbia, in
'94. On Friday she aimed for her third title.
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards missing because of a
foot operation, fellow Englishman Julian Golley was favored to win
the triple jump and Stuart Rendell was expected to make it three
titles in a row for Australia in the hammer after triumphs by Sean
Carlin at Auckland and Victoria.

New Zealand's foreign minister nominated for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Foreign Affairs Minister Don
McKinnon has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, a Cabinet
minister announced Friday.
	   The nomination, from Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare, was for
McKinnon's work brokering the Bougainville peace deal.
	   Henare told the Dominion newspaper he made the nomination about
six months ago and he was hopeful McKinnon would get it.
	   McKinnon was the driving force behind talks which began in New
Zealand aimed at bringing peace to Bougainville, after more than 20
years of civil unrest on the Papua New Guinean island.
	   About 20,000 people died in the 9-year-long civil war. A
cease-fire was signed this year.
	   There are five Nobel prizes -- for peace, literature, chemistry,
physics and medicine.
	   Previous winners include the late Mother Theresa, for her work
with the poor in Calcutta, Myanmar (Burma) opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, Archbishop Desmond Tutu from South Africa and East
Timor pro-independence leader Jose Ramos Horta.
	   McKinnon is also considered a strong contender for the
Commonwealth secretary-general's job, due to come up next year.
	   He is overseas and unavailable for comment.

	   China's actually used foreign investment from January to August
slipped 1.45 percent to dlrs 27.42 billion from the same period in

Australian world champion kicked out of Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's deeply divided cycling
team was torn apart Friday when world champion Lucy Tyler-Sharman
was kicked out of the Commonwealth Games.
	   The decision to dump Sharman-Tyler was made by Australian chef
de mission Don Stockins after the 3,000-meter individual pursuit
world champion criticized team management.
	   Tyler-Sharman was one of three leading Australian riders in
conflict with head coach Charlie Walsh's methods before the world
championship in Bordeaux, France, last month.
	   The latest drama cost Tyler-Sharman her chance to ride for
bronze in Friday night's finals, and further embarrassed a cycling
outfit dubbed Team Tabloid for its constant squabbling and bitter
infighting.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' Stockins said.
	   Tyler-Sharman accused team officials of sabotaging her bike.
Both feet came out of the pedals during her semifinal.
	   The Australians held an overwhelming lead in the medal standings
going into Day 8 with 50 to nearest challenger England's 16, but
the cycling scandal has taken the attention away from the rest of
the team.
	   There has also been controversy over former Olympic champion
Kathy Watt, who refused to stay with her road race teammates, and
the presence of Neil Stephens, implicated in the Tour de France
drug scandal.
	   Malaysia picked up its fifth gold medal Friday when Nurul Huda
Baharin won the women's individual air rifle event at Langkawi
Island. She scored 494.8 points to win from Sharon Bowes of Canada
(493.3) and Louise Minett of England (491.7).
	   Canada's James Paton won the men's individual full-bore rifle
gold medal with 402 points. Malaysia's Zainal Abidin Md Zain took
the silver with 400 and Andrew Luckman of England collected the
bronze, also with 400.
	   The third night of track and field finals was expected to suffer
a letdown after Thursday's men's 100-meter title, won by Trinidad
and Tobago's Ato Boldon in 9.88 seconds.
	   Welsh pair Iwan Thomas and Jamie Baulch were to tussle for the
400-meter title, and were expected to take the final more seriously
than they did the semi, when the pair held a conversation down the
stretch.
	   Australian Darryl Wohlsen ran the fastest 200-meter time in the
heats Friday in an event left wide open by the absence of 100-meter
medalists Boldon, Frankie Fredericks and Obadele Thompson.
	   Running in the first of the eight heats, Wohlsen clocked 20.68
on a track dampened by early morning rain while bigger names, such
as Scotland's European champion Doug Walker and English veteran
John Regis, were around a second slower.
	   Walker, returning to action three weeks after knee surgery,
placed second in his heat to Ghana's Azziz Zakari, who clocked
20.72 to the Scot's 20.77.
	   New Zealand's cricket team bounced back from its embarrassing
loss to Australia to post 212 for seven in the bronze medal playoff
against Sri Lanka.
	   The Kiwis, bowled out for just 58 in the semi, were well led by
opener Nathan Astle (56) and allrounder Chris Harris, who finished
unbeaten on 55.

Kiwis hit 212 against Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Allrounder Chris Harris belted an
unbeaten 55 to lift New Zealand to 212 for seven off 50 overs in
the Commonwealth Games cricket bronze medal playoff against Sri
Lanka on Friday.
	   The Kiwis bounced back from a dismal performance against
Australia in the semifinal, where they were dismissed for 58 and
lost by nine wickets.
	   Opener Nathan Astle led the way with 56 off 84 balls before he
was run out, but it was Harris' intervention that helped increase
the run rate.
	   He started cautiously but ended with five sixes including one in
a final over that yielded 17 runs and two wickets.
	   Australia will play South Africa on Saturday for the first ever
Commonwealth gold medal in cricket.

New Zealand's foreign minister nominated for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Foreign Affairs Minister Don
McKinnon has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, a Cabinet
minister announced Friday.
	   The nomination, from Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare, was for
McKinnon's work brokering the Bougainville peace deal.
	   Henare told the Dominion newspaper he made the nomination about
six months ago and he was hopeful McKinnon would get it.
	   McKinnon was the driving force behind talks which began in New
Zealand aimed at bringing peace to Bougainville, after more than 20
years of civil unrest on the Papua New Guinean island.
	   About 20,000 people died in the 9-year-long civil war. A
cease-fire was signed this year.
	   There are five Nobel prizes _ for peace, literature, chemistry,
physics and medicine.
	   Previous winners include the late Mother Theresa, for her work
with the poor in Calcutta, Myanmar (Burma) opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, Archbishop Desmond Tutu from South Africa and East
Timor pro-independence leader Jose Ramos Horta.
	   McKinnon is also considered a strong contender for the
Commonwealth secretary-general's job, due to come up next year.
	   He was overseas and unavailable for comment.

Crackdown on China's futures markets amid protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSHUA CHERIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The government is tightening controls of China's
unruly futures markets in an attempt to curb speculative trading
and prevent riots by clients cheated out of their money.
	   This week, market regulators closed 12 brokerages for trading
violations, bringing the number of closures this year to more than
20. The companies closed down included Champion Futures, a
brokerage based in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong
Kong, whose top executives have since disappeared, as has 50
million yuan (dlrs 6 million) in company funds.
	   Angry clients of Champion Futures attempted to storm its offices
Thursday, demanding their money back. Company employees said that
although the company was insolvent, it had continued to accept new
clients in order to pay old clients and debts.
	   Futures markets are exchanges where agreements are made to buy
or sell a specific amount of a commodity or financial instrument at
a particular price on a stipulated future date.
	   Experts say such markets in China are plagued by rampant
speculation, commonplace corruption and mostly absent regulators.
	   To prevent the situation from getting further out of hand, the
China Securities Regulatory Commission is moving ahead with a
massive merger of the country's futures exchanges.
	   The merger, which was announced in August and is to take place
by the end of 1998, will involve trimming the current 14 futures
exchanges to just three, and closing all but 12 of 35 futures
contracts. The measures are a continuation of a crackdown that
started in 1996, when the commission began to audit and inspect
brokerages for trading irregularities.
	   Since then, more than 40 brokerages have been closed, many for
trading foreign financial futures, a practice prohibited in China.
Others were closed for signing contracts promising high investment
returns and failing to deliver.
	   The moves appear to signal a shift in the government's thinking
about financial markets in general.
	   With other Asian economies reeling from the effects of newly
liberalized markets, the introduction of relatively new, complex
financial tools seems unlikely.
	   China may give up earlier plans to establish new futures
contracts for oil, sugar and other commodities, as well as options
on copper and new government bond futures, traders said in
interviews with Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The Securities Regulatory Commission also is engineering a shift
toward the least speculative contracts. Margin requirements for
every contract _ except copper, aluminum and soybeans, which are
linked to international markets _ will jump to 10 percent from 5
percent as of September 1999.
	   Doubling the margin requirement will make trading far more
expensive, and speculation far less attractive.
	   ``Even before the currency crisis, China started to cool down
the futures market because they perceived that it facilitated
speculation,'' said Eddie Wong, a Hong Kong-based economist with
ABM-Amro Asia. ``If China wants to boost domestic demand, there are
better alternatives than (futures) speculation.''

Most Asian markets dragged down by global woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets followed overnight
falls in Europe, Latin America and the United States to open
sharply lower Friday.
	   Concern about political unrest in Indonesia and a weakening
economy in Hong Kong also dragged down prices.
	   Singapore's key index plunged 3.2 percent at the midday close,
and Hong Kong fell 1.4 percent. Japan's benchmark average alone
bucked the trend, rising slightly in morning trading.
	   Market participants said investors remained discouraged after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dashed hopes of a
joint effort by the industrialized nations for a multinational
interest rate cut.
	   The plunges in stock prices around the world overnight _ 2.7
percent on Wall Street, 4.8 percent in Brazil, 5.5 percent in Paris
and 3 percent in London _ also intensified bearish sentiment.
	   The Philippine's PSE index closed down 7.5 percent on global
woes and profit-taking, wiping out Thursday's 7.9-percent rally.
Indonesia's benchmark index opened down 2.3 percent to a five-year
low. South Korea's Kospi index fell 2.5 percent.
	   Share prices in Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan were also lower.
	   In Japan, stock prices opened lower but rebounded as selling
pressure eased ahead of Prime Minister Keizo Obuzi's visit to the
United States next week.
	   After plunging 2.38 percent to a 12-year low Thursday, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 60.49 points, or 0.44
percent, to 13,919.63 at the midday close.
	   The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, trading at 131.12
yen to the dollar in midday trading, down 2.18 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 132.18 late in New
York overnight.
	   Investors are hoping that Japan's ruling and opposition parties
will reach a compromise on banking reform in time for Obuchi's U.S.
visit, traders said.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   Both sides agreed to resume negotiations later Friday.
	   In Hong Kong, investors continued to dump local shares, bracing
for more bleak news about corporate earnings and the shrinking
economy.
	   The government announced after trading closed Thursday that
unemployment was at a new five-year high of 5 percent. Hong Kong
Telecom, a major private employer, announced a 10 percent pay cut
for all employees.
	   The Hang Seng Index, following Thursday's 3.6-percent plunge,
fell even lower throughout the morning.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX index fell amid fears over uncertain
domestic political conditions.
	   On Thursday, pro-democracy activists protested outside
Parliament against proposed laws to curb freedom of expression,
while the military imposed a curfew in a riot-torn fishing town.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian soldiers have been given
approval to use the sort of performance-enhancing drugs banned by

reported Friday.

	   _Creatine powder, a natural substance in the muscles that stores
high-energy phosphate.
	   _Caffeine, which can improve endurance in doses equivalent to
six or seven cups of coffee.
	   _Ephedrine, banned in sports but which gives an extra boost to

U.S. investment firm takes over South Korea's Ssangyong Securities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hambrecht and Quist takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In the first foreign takeover of a
South Korean securities company, U.S. investment firm Hambrecht and
Quist Group Inc. signed a deal Friday to take over financially
troubled Ssangyong Investment and Securities Co.
	   The deal calls for Hambrecht and Quist's Asian unit _ or
Hambrecht and Quist Asia Pacific _ to buy Ssangyong Group's entire
28.11-percent controlling stake in Ssangyong Investment and
Securities.
	   At current stock market prices, the deal is estimated at dlrs
172 million. But it allows Hambrecht and Quist to pay between 25 to
40 percent of the market price one year later, Ssangyong officials
said.
	   As part of the deal, South Korean creditor banks also will
provide dlrs 158 million in new loans to help improve Ssangyong
Securities' cash flow, the officials said.
	   In return, Hambrecht and Quist will inject dlrs 110 million into
Ssangyong by buying new shares and issuing convertible bonds.
	   That will raise Hambrecht and Quist's stake to 50 percent, the
officials said.
	   Currently, subsidiaries of the Ssangyong Securities conglomerate
own 28.11 percent of Ssangyong Securities. The rest of the company
is divided among small investors.
	   In August, the government's Financial Supervisory Commission
ordered Ssangyong and three other financially unstable securities
firms to restructure or face closure.
	   The government so far has shut down 16 merchant banks and forced
five commercial banks to be merged with bigger banks as part of its
efforts to reform South Korea's inefficient financial sector.
	   The restructuring is a key promise South Korea made in exchange
for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of its economy by the International
Monetary Fund in December.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On the tenth anniversary of the
military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested
in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling
for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.
	   ``We are calling on the military dictators to release all
political prisoners, which include elected members of parliament,
students, many of whom were recently arrested,'' said Angelay, the
spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic Front.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. The current military government came to
power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide
democracy movement.
	   ``Today is the tenth anniversary of the military takeover.
People in Burma have been suffering for 10 years,'' said Angelay.
	   The protesters were joined by ten Thai university students and
one Canadian activist.
	   ``I'm not aware of any law that prohibits me from taking part in
the demonstration. But I have been warned by the Burmese students
that I face possible arrest and deportation,'' said Paul Beaulie, a
resident of Quebec.

Indian star headed to Toronto

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian batting sensation Sachin
Tendulkar will rush to Toronto to join the rest of his team, but
won't arrive before the last of five one-day matches against
Pakistan, United News of India reported Friday.
	   The Board of Control for Cricket in India had decided Thursday
to send Tendulkar to Canada following his failed effort to boost
India's chances at the Commonwealth Games. But the news agency said
Tendulkar didn't hear of his new assignment until Friday.
	   Teammate Ajay Jadeja, who played alongside Tendulkar at the
Commonwealth tournament in Malaysia, got the word earlier and left
for Canada Thursday night, UNI reported. Jadeja was expected to
play in match four, with India trailing 1-2.
	   BCCI President Raj Singh Dungapur said the earliest flight
Tendulkar could take would be at midnight Friday.
	   Indian selectors had been criticized for splitting up their
stars. The selectors were under pressure from the Indian Olympic
Association to send top players to the Commonwealth Games. But they
also had to contend with Pakistan picking its strongest squad for
the Sahara Cup in Canada.
	   India was drummed out of the Commonwealth tournament Tuesday by
Australia, which advanced to the semifinals with that victory.

Thailand to join international disarmament group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has applied or membership in
the Conference on Disarmament to heighten its bargaining power in
lobbying nuclear states to sign a test ban treaty for Southeast
Asia, a foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Membership in the international group would provide Thailand and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with a new channel to
lobby nuclear powers to sign the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapon
Free Zone treaty, said Kobsak Chutikul, the Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
	   The treaty was signed in Bangkok in 1995 by the nine Southeast
Asian countries that make up the regional bloc, plus Cambodia. It
bans the use, manufacture and stockpiling of nuclear weapons in the
region, but nuclear powers such as the United States, China and
India have not agreed to sign it.
	   It would also ban ships and submarines carrying missiles with
nuclear warheads from entering the region's waters, presenting
problems for the fleets of some countries with nuclear
capabilities.
	   Thailand's application for Conference on Disarmament membership
was submitted by the country's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, Krit Garnjana-goonchon, to his British counterpart, Ian
Soutar, chairman of the Conference early this month, said Kobsak.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stock prices finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar slipped against the yen Friday following
a sharp drop overnight in U.S. stocks and Latin American financial
markets. Tokyo share prices finished higher.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 132.36 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down
1.94 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its rate of 132.18
late in New York overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.98 points,
or 0.89 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,983.12. The rise
followed a large decline on Thursday, when the Nikkei closed down
338.56 points, or 2.38 percent, to a 12-year low of 13,859.14.
	   Traders said the dollar carried over from its weakness in New
York on Thursday following a renewed decline in U.S. and Latin
American share prices.
	   The dollar was also under pressure as some Japanese businesses
began selling the U.S. currency for yen to bring money home and
beef up their balance sheets before the end of the fiscal half-year
on Sept. 30.
	   Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon
Credit Bank, said the dollar also came under pressure from
lingering speculation about a possible U.S. interest rate cut.
Lower rates hurt a country's currency by lowering returns for
investors.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei 225 average rebounded from an
early decline as selling pressure eased ahead of Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States.
	   Share prices started lower after a steep overnight fall on Wall
Street, but later moved into positive territory on short-covering
and position adjustment ahead of the weekend, traders said.
	   Investors hope that Japan's ruling and opposition parties will
reach a compromise on banking reform in time for Obuchi's visit to
the United States next week, traders said.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   LTCB shares, which fell to the previous low of 19 yen on Monday,
moved to an all-time low of 18 yen in late afternoon amid continued
uncertainties about the troubled bank's future. LTCB stocks closed
Friday at 19 yen per share.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 4.16 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,073.22. On
Thursday, the TOPIX closed down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to
1,069.06.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.690 percent from 0.665 percent on
Thursday, driving its price down to 115.40 from 115.60 yen.

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II slipped
off her white pumps, donned a white prayer robe and gingerly padded
about one of the most magnificent mosques in modern Islam on
Friday.
	   The queen began the second day of her state visit to this
oil-rich sultanate, a former British colony on the northern tip of
Borneo island, by paying respects to Islam. Most of the 312,000
people in this tiny Southeast Asian kingdom are Muslim.
	   Wearing a blue, wide-brimmed hat and floor-length prayer robe
designed for her in London, the queen was escorted through the
Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque.
	   In the cavernous male prayer room, some 150 men sat
crossed-legged on their golden prayer rugs in identical black felt
``songkok'' caps and embroidered sarongs as the queen strolled
behind them in her stocking feet. Her gloved hands clasped, the
queen softly inquired about the gold-plated Arabic calligraphy of
Koranic verse carved into the white Italian marble.
	   The mosque covers 20 acres, with 29 marble domes and 29 white
marble steps, symbolizing Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th Sultan
of the 600-year-old Bolkiah dynasty.
	   The queen walked through the lower courtyard to visit hundreds
of children _ girls in pink Muslim head scarves and boys in black
caps _ kneeled in front of wooden stands cradling tiny Korans.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his new wife, Gaynor
Regan, were among those in the queen's entourage, all in stocking
feet, the women in black prayer robes.
	   Zaini Ali, the mosque architect who escorted the queen, said she
was most impressed by a compulsory pre-marital counseling class.
	   ``She was jumping up and down, she was so excited,'' said the
British-trained architect. He said the queen turned to Cook and
said, ``We should try something like this.''
	   The Church of England does not require marriage counseling. The
royal couple is celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, but
their children have been plagued by divorce, including that of
Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.
	   Zaini may not have known his comments would raise gleeful
eyebrows among the British press on the tour. The tabloids have
skewered Cook for recently leaving his wife of 28 years and
marrying his former aide.
	   It's the royal couple's first state visit to Brunei since 1972,
12 years before the sultanate gained full independence from the
United Kingdom.
	   Though Brunei today is one of the wealthiest countries in the
world _ people pay no taxes and medical care and education are free
_ it has not been immune to the Asian contagion that has gripped
the region.
	   With the global plunge in the price of oil, wecedented step of
forming a special commission to study ways in which to revamp its
economy.
	   In Buckingham Palace's push to promote the British royals as
more people-friendly, the queen will also visit a health clinic at
a village built on stilts along the Brunei River.
	   Earlier in the day, the royal couple watched the Alliance Parade
of the Royal Brunei Land Forces and the British Army Royal Gurkha
Rifles. Bagpipers played a selection of Scottish tunes similar to
the Queen's own piper who plays outside her window at Buckingham
Palace.
	   The Queen clearly enjoyed the military parade and tapped both
feet in time with the music.
	   Prince Philip, who upon his arrival Thursday forgot that
pointing with the index finger is considered bad manners in Brunei,
kept his hands firmly clasped in his lap.

Most Asian markets dragged down by global woes

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets followed overnight
falls in Europe, Latin America and the United States to open
sharply lower Friday.
	   Concern about political unrest in Indonesia and a weakening
economy in Hong Kong also dragged down prices.
	   Singapore's key index plunged 3.2 percent at the midday close,
and Hong Kong fell 1.4 percent. Japan's benchmark average alone
bucked the trend, rising slightly in morning trading.
	   Market participants said investors remained discouraged after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dashed hopes of a
joint effort by the industrialized nations for a multinational
interest rate cut.
	   The plunges in stock prices around the world overnight _ 2.7
percent on Wall Street, 4.8 percent in Brazil, 5.5 percent in Paris
and 3 percent in London _ also intensified bearish sentiment.
	   The Philippine's PSE index closed down 7.5 percent on global
woes and profit-taking, wiping out Thursday's 7.9-percent rally.
Indonesia's benchmark index opened down 2.3 percent to a five-year
low. South Korea's Kospi index fell 2.5 percent.
	   Share prices in Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan were also lower.
	   In Japan, stock prices opened lower but rebounded as selling
pressure eased ahead of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the
United States next week.
	   After plunging 2.38 percent to a 12-year low Thursday, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 60.49 points, or 0.44
percent, to 13,919.63 at the midday close.
	   The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, trading at 131.12
yen to the dollar in midday trading, down 2.18 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 132.18 late in New
York overnight.
	   Investors are hoping that Japan's ruling and opposition parties
will reach a compromise on banking reform in time for Obuchi's U.S.
visit, traders said.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   Both sides agreed to resume negotiations later Friday.
	   In Hong Kong, investors continued to dump local shares, bracing
for more bleak news about corporate earnings and the shrinking
economy.
	   The government announced after trading closed Thursday that
unemployment was at a new five-year high of 5 percent. Hong Kong
Telecom, a major private employer, announced a 10 percent pay cut
for all employees.
	   The Hang Seng Index, following Thursday's 3.6-percent plunge,
fell even lower throughout the morning.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX index fell amid fears over uncertain
domestic political conditions.
	   On Thursday, pro-democracy activists protested outside
Parliament against proposed laws to curb freedom of expression,
while the military imposed a curfew in a riot-torn fishing town.

Police detain seven in connection with assault on radio show host
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police have detained six men and one woman in
connection with the brutal attack on a controversial radio host
last month, a police spokesman said Friday.
	   Police in charge of organized crime rounded up eight men and six
women, aged between 22 to 67, following a series of raids
throughout Hong Kong late Thursday, the spokesman said on customary
condition of annoynimity.
	   No charges have been made, and seven people were released
Thursday on bail, he said.
	   Last month, two assailants attacked Albert Cheng with meat
cleavers outside of the radio station just before his popular daily
morning talk show, inflicting six serious wounds.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted an unnamed police source as
saying some of the suspects were members of 14K, one of Hong Kong's
largest gangs.
	   The spokesman refused to say whether police have determined the
motive of the attack.
	   Cheng has claimed his assailants wanted to kill him because of
his outspokenness. He is famous for his blistering attacks on
government officials, businessmen, crime bosses and ordinary
people.
	   His co-host Lam Yuk-wah and several guest hosts have continued
the morning show, but apparently have toned down on their
criticism.

Floods in west threaten power supply in north India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Flooding in western India threatens
power supplies in the north, the Times of India reported Friday.
	   The supply point of a 1,700-kilometer (1,000-mile) natural gas
pipeline was affected by the flooding in western Gujarat state, the
newspaper reported. Supplies were cut off Thursday morning to
several natural gas-fueled power plants in northern Uttar Pradesh,
India's most populous state.
	   Officials were quoted as saying supplies on hand at the plants
would run out in 36 hours. The petroleum ministry called an
emergency meeting Thursday at which officials began preparing to
supply alternative fuels to the plants.
	   It was not clear how long the pipeline would remain closed.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's president and international
officials are urging Albanians to disregard calls by ex-President
Sali Berisha for a nationwide protest Friday to force the current
government to resign.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   President Rexhep Meidani also issued a public appeal for calm
after meeting with Everts and other Western officials, who fear the
protest could spark unrest similar to the two days of rioting this
week that brought Albania to the brink of anarchy for the second
time in 18 months.
	   The capital was calm early Friday morning, with little visible
police presence or other signs of anticipated trouble. On previous
days, police set up road blocks later in the morning to check for
weapons.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has applied for membership in
the Conference on Disarmament to heighten its bargaining power in
lobbying nuclear states to sign a test ban treaty for Southeast
Asia, a foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Membership in the international group would provide Thailand and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with a new channel to
lobby nuclear powers to sign the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapon
Free Zone treaty, said Kobsak Chutikul, the Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
	   The treaty was signed in Bangkok in 1995 by the nine Southeast
Asian countries that make up the regional bloc, plus Cambodia. It
bans the use, manufacture and stockpiling of nuclear weapons in the
region, but nuclear powers such as the United States, China and
India have not agreed to sign it.
	   It would also ban ships and submarines carrying missiles with
nuclear warheads from entering the region's waters, presenting
problems for the fleets of some countries with nuclear
capabilities.
	   Thailand's application for Conference on Disarmament membership
was submitted by the country's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, Krit Garnjana-goonchon, to his British counterpart, Ian
Soutar, chairman of the Conference early this month, said Kobsak.

Talks on global warming wrap up in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Countries preparing for an upcoming global warming
conference ended talks Friday vowing to iron out differences over
the participation of developing nations and trading pollution
credits.
	   The meeting was a follow-up to last year's conference in Kyoto,
where the United States, Europe and Japan agreed to cut emissions
of so-called greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
	   The ministers who gathered in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday laid
out positions on two contentious issues not settled in Kyoto:
whether and how much poorer countries should be required to cut
emissions; and to what extent countries should be able to trade
pollution credits.
	   The United States is pushing for stronger commitments to help
reduce global warming by developing nations ahead of this year's
international conference in Buenos Aires in November.
	   Washington argues that in some developing countries,
environmental concerns have been pushed aside in the rush for
economic development, and that any agreement to cut emissions is
incomplete without their participation.
	   ``In our meetings, the United States made clear that developing
countries must be part of the solution,'' said Stuart Eizenstat,
under secretary for economic, business and agricultural affairs.
	   Developing nations, however, have argued that it is unfair for
rich countries to force poorer nations to bear the costs of
environmental protection before they've had a chance to develop.
	   The European Union has taken a more cautious approach with
developing countries, urging ministers to focus more on their own
domestic efforts before pressuring poorer nations for cuts.
	   ``The developed world must be willing to show what they are
willing to do before they ask the developing world to come on
board,'' said Ritt Bjerregaard, European commissioner for
environment.
	   Another sticking point is the trading of pollution credits,
which would allow a country overproducing greenhouse gases to buy
the rights to pollute more from cleaner countries.
	   The United States is pushing this idea to satisfy business
groups who argue cutting emissions of pollutants will damage their
industries.
	   But the European Union is eager to put limits on the practice to
avoid allowing rich countries to overpollute by buying credits from
cash-starved developing nations.
	   ``What we want to see is very clear rules,'' said Bjerregaard.

Unconcerned Suharto prays amid doubts over corruption probe
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto prayed at a
mosque Friday as critics said they doubted an Indonesian government
investigation into corruption allegations against him would amount
to much.
	   Suharto looked unconcerned and smiled as he arrived for weekly
prayers with one of his six children, Bambang Trihatmodjo, who is
at the center of a separate banking scandal inquiry.
	   This week, President B.J. Habibie, a longtime friend and former
subordinate of Suharto, bowed to mounting pressure from protesters
and others and ordered that the former leader be questioned.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   He is accused of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts while his family built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   In a television appearance last week he flatly denied any
wrongdoing and said he did not have ``a cent'' stashed away
overseas.
	   The exact form that the investigation will take appeared
confused Friday.
	   Justice Minister Muladi on Thursday promised it would be
thorough and fair. He even raised the possibility of Suharto
eventually facing trial and, if convicted, possibly being
imprisoned.
	   However, later State Secretary Akbar Tanjung told reporters the
inquiry would seek ``clarification'' from Suharto about his wealth
rather than investigate it.
	   Habibie has also called on Indonesians to stop personal attacks
against Suharto.
	   Opponents doubt the investigation headed by Attorney General
Muhammad Andi Ghali will result in a trial.
	   Some say the government, which is full of former Suharto allies
including Habibie, has neither the will nor the ability to build a
strong case and make corruption charges stick.
	   ``I'm worried that the efforts to investigate Suharto's fortune
is only a political theater,'' the newspaper Merdeka quoted Amein
Rais, a prominent Muslim leader who heads a new opposition party,
as saying.
	   Rais warned of possible unrest if the investigation cleared
Suharto.
	   Former supreme judge Adi Andojo predicted the investigation
would fail.
	   ``I am pessimist that Suharto's wealth can be probed or that he
will be put on trial,'' he said. ``The legal system in Indonesia
itself has not been cleaned of corruption.''
	   Jeffrey Winters, a political science professor at Northwestern
University in Chicago, said that a halfhearted investigation ``will
produce a whitewash for Suharto.''
	   ``Tracking hidden and stolen wealth is an extremely difficult
process requiring some of the most talented lawyers and
investigative accountants in the world,'' he said in an article in
the Jakarta Post.
	   ``I doubt whether the attorney general or his staff would get
very far, even if they wanted to,'' he said.

Police detain seven in connection with assault on radio show host

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police have detained six men and one woman in
connection with the brutal attack on a controversial radio host
last month, a police spokesman said Friday.
	   Police in charge of investigating organized crime rounded up
eight men and six women, aged between 22 to 67, in a series of
raids throughout Hong Kong late Thursday, the spokesman said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   No charges have been made, and seven people were released
Thursday on bail, he said.
	   Last month, two assailants attacked Albert Cheng with meat
cleavers outside of the radio station just before his popular daily
morning talk show, inflicting six serious wounds.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted an unnamed police source as
saying some of the suspects were members of 14K, one of Hong Kong's
largest gangs.
	   The spokesman refused to say whether police have determined the
motive of the attack.
	   Cheng has claimed his assailants wanted to kill him because of
his outspokenness. He is famous for his blistering attacks on
government officials, businessmen, crime bosses and ordinary
people.
	   His co-host Lam Yuk-wah and several guest hosts have continued
the morning show, but apparently have toned down on their
criticism.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ While the government tried to broker
a last-minute deal to keep Philippine Airlines in business, two
smaller carriers were grounded Friday in another severe blow to the
country's airline industry.
	   Regulators said they suspended the operating certificate for Air
Philippines, the country's second-largest airline, for failure to
comply with safety standards. Grand International Airways, a
smaller carrier, canceled its flights because of unpaid insurance
and fuel bills, employees said.
	   The shutdowns and the scheduled closure next week of Philippine
Airlines threaten a potentially devastating blow to the country,
leaving many areas of the sprawling archipelago of 7,000 islands
without air service.
	   The president of PAL's flight attendants' union, Roberto
Anduiza, called PAL's decision Thursday to close down ``an economic
disaster of national proportions.'' He said the union would be
willing to make sacrifices to prevent a closure.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it decided to shut down next
Wednesday because its rebuilding efforts were no longer viable
following its unions' refusal to accept a management-proposed
rescue plan.
	   President Joseph Estrada met Thursday night with union
officials, who said they will consider his request that PAL workers
be allowed to vote directly on the rescue plan.
	   ``I will try my best to settle this problem,'' Estrada said. ``I
am keeping my fingers crossed.''
	   Estrada planned to talk Friday to Lucio Tan, PAL's main
stockholder and chairman, and then meet with union leaders again on
Monday.
	   Tan has offered airline employees 20 percent ownership of the
company in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement _ a condition which officials of all three PAL
unions say is unacceptable.
	   ``If you try to take away the soul of the union, we will have to
uphold our principles,'' said Abel Capili, a board member of the
ground workers' union. ``We may have to accept the closure of
PAL.''
	   But a PAL executive held out hope Friday that the airline may
still survive.
	   Asked if PAL would reverse its decision to end its 57-year
history if it reaches a settlement with the unions, executive vice
president Manolo Aquino replied, ``Yes, we will try to put on the
brakes.''
	   But he added, ``As we come closer to the deadline, the
possibility of stopping the closure becomes dimmer.''
	   Aquino said Tan, who holds an estimated 70 percent of PAL's
stock, is still hopeful the unions will accept the
management-proposed rescue.
	   Tan's proposal would give workers three board seats, and each
worker would receive 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos
(about dlrs 6,900).
	   PAL has been devastated by a series of strikes and by Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   In June it was crippled by a 22-day pilots' strike. It fired the
pilots, cut most of its routes and laid off 5,000 of its nearly
14,000 workers. But the layoffs triggered a strike by ground
personnel.
	   Aquino said the airline's fate also rests in the hands of its
creditors, to which it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   Foreign creditors have loaned the airline an estimated dlrs 1.6
billion, with the bulk coming from a consortium of European banks
led by Credit Agricole Indosuez to help finance the
fleet-modernization program.

Tajikistan hit by deadly anthrax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Health officials fear this central
Asian nation is on the verge of an anthrax epidemic after some 200
cases of the deadly disease were registered.
	   Medical officials told local reporters Thursday that the disease
had appeared in several regions and there were concerns it would
spread. The disease usually comes from infected cattle.
	   Efforts to contain the outbreaks were being hindered by a
shortage of medicine to deal with the disease because of a serious
lack of funds, the officials said.
	   There have been anthrax cases in recent years, but they were
contained by vaccination and other preventative measures.

U.S. official expresses deep concern over Japan's trade surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Washington is ``deeply concerned'' about a huge
Japanese trade surplus that threatens to raise ``a protectionist
backlash'' in the United States, U.S. Undersecretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat said Friday.
	   Eizenstat, visiting Tokyo with Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, said the United States' deficit with Japan is likely to
hit a historic high this year and urged the government to move
quickly to boost the economy and make the nation less dependent on
overseas markets.
	   ``It is critical that Japan's recovery be, as the government of
Japan itself has insisted, domestic demand-led, not export-led,''
he told reporters in Tokyo.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan was expected to soar to nearly
dlrs 70 billion this year.
	   Japan's Asian neighbors have been devastated by an economic
meltdown that has driven leading companies into bankruptcy and
plunged millions into poverty. Economists say the only way out of
the slump is for Asian nations to take advantage of their
drastically devalued currencies to increase export sales.
	   Early in the crisis _ now more than a year old _ it was hoped
Japan would lead the recovery, but the world's second largest
economy has itself slipped into recession.
	   Eizenstat said, earlier this week, the United States would do
its best to promote recovery by buying products from struggling
Asian nations, but he called on Japan to get its economy back on
track so it could help.
	   Japan's trade surplus has ballooned not because of a big
increase in exports but due to a dramatic decline in imports. U.S.
policymakers say boosting the Japanese economy would help curb the
surplus by increasing demand for imported goods.
	   To revitalize Japan's economy, Eizenstat said Tokyo should focus
on three areas: government spending, reforming the banking system,
and deregulation.
	   Eizenstat met Japanese government officials, businessmen and
academics in Tokyo and attended a conference on global climate
change. He arrived in Japan this week with Barshefsky who met
Japanese trade officials to press Japan to open its markets to U.S.
products as a way of trimming Japan's trade surplus.
	   The visits helped pave the way for discussions between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi set
for next Tuesday in New York.

Organizers to make profit from 1998 games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is going to make a profit
from the 1998 Commonwealth Games, the chief organizer said Friday.
	   Sukom 98, the organizing committee, expects a surplus of 5
million ringgit (dlrs 1.5 million), said executive chairman Hashim
Mohd. Ali.
	   The profit would be a pleasant surprise because Sukom has
struggled to balance its books since Malaysia sank into an economic
crisis over the last year and funds for the games were slashed by
10 percent.
	   ``The surplus we forecast is after we settle all our dues,
including the teams' rights with the Olympic Council of Malaysia,''
Hashim said.
	   Hashim said the company's two major shareholders _ the
government and the OCM _ would decide where the surplus should go.
	   The committee had organized the 10-day event with 360 million
ringgit (dlrs 95 million).
	   Malaysia has also spent millions of dollars on building and
upgrading sports arenas, including the Bukit Jalil stadium, which
cost dlrs 300 million to build.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OPEN DOORS: Boxing enthusiasts can watch pugilists free at the
16th Commonwealth Games.
	   Spectators will also be allowed in free at the shooting range in
the northern Malaysian town of Langkawi, said Rosly Selamat, an
official on the organizing committee.
	   In addition, Rosly said people who had tickets for Monday's
closing ceremony would be allowed to come in early and watch the
final day of athletics.
	   Events scheduled Monday include the men's 1,500-meter final and
the 4 X 100 relay.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VILLAGE RATS: Officials under pressure to keep up hygiene and
sanitation standards at the athletes' village have caught one dozen
rats this month.
	   Health staff also have been spraying anti-mosquito chemicals
every four days.
	   Concern about health was triggered by cases or suspected cases
of dengue fever in the village.
	   So far, a New Zealand team doctor and a Malaysian athlete have
been diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease carried by
mosquitoes. An Australian team official and the wife of an official
have been hospitalized with suspected dengue fever.

Singapore hangs two drug traffickers; arrests 165 in nationwide
</HEADLINE>
drug bust

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore authorities hanged two men for
trafficking drugs on Friday and wrapped up a 24-hour nationwide
anti-narcotics campaign that netted 165 arrests.
	   Mohd Ariff Bin Mat Rifin, a 39-year old Malaysian convicted of
smuggling cannabis in 1996, and Loh Kim Cheng, a 31-year old
Singaporean caught trafficking morphine in 1997, were executed at
dawn inside Changi Prison, according to a statement from the
Central Narcotics Bureau.
	   Under Singapore's strict drug laws, adults caught trafficking
more than 15 grams (half an ounce) of heroin, 30 grams (one ounce)
of morphine or 500 grams (18 ounces) of cannabis face the death
penalty.
	   The executions coincided with the end of an island-wide drug
raid involving 100 officers who seized a total of 251 grams (8.8
ounces) of heroin, 5.4 grams (0.2 ounce) of methamphetamine, and
over 500 psychotropic tablets, according to Muhammad Azni Sarbini,
an intelligence director at the narcotics bureau.
	   Singapore has sent more than 300 people to the gallows, mostly
for drug-related offenses, since tough anti-drug laws were imposed
in 1975.

Nuclear reactor project in North Korea likely to be further delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea is concerned about a
possible further delay in a project aimed at halting North Korea's
suspect nuclear program, government officials said Friday.
	   The delay, which appears inevitable, may give North Korea an
excuse to revive what western experts feared was an attempt to
build nuclear weapons.
	   North Korea abandoned its nuclear program under a 1994 accord
with the United States in exchange for two commercial reactors that
do not produce significant amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.
	   The new reactors were supposed to be completed in 2003. Site
preparation in a remote seaside village in North Korea was
completed in August. Construction was due to begin in mid-October.
	   That schedule is in doubt because of controversy over North
Korea's recent firing of a long-range rocket over Japan, a key
financier of the dlrs 4.6 billion project.
	   ``It's realistically impossible to start building the reactors
this year, not to mention mid-October,'' one Seoul government
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Plans by South Korea, Japan and the United States to sign a
cost-sharing agreement for the project were suspended because of
North Korea's firing of what was believed to have been a ballistic
missile on Aug. 31.
	   The rocket overflew Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Japan, angered, retaliated by freezing its pledge to contribute
dlrs 1 billion to the project. South Korea's share is dlrs 3.22
billion and the United States is responsible for the remaining dlrs
380 million.
	   The three countries are scheduled to meet in New York Sept.
28-30 to resolve the issue but there is little chance that they
will come to agreement unless Japan changes its stance, Seoul
officials said.
	   Under a package deal struck with North Korea in New York early
this month, the United States promised that construction of the
reactors would start in November, about a month behind schedule.
	   But even that revised schedule cannot be met without agreement
on allocation of costs, Seoul officials said.
	   Experts say that the reactor project is already three or four
years behind schedule.
	   South Korea's state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation has
been chosen as the builder-operator of the reactors, which have a
rated capacity of 1,000 megawatts each.
	   Despite repeated denials, North Korea, a Marxist country, is
believed to have extracted enough weapons-grade plutonium to make
at least one atomic bomb.

Former Thai prime minister will surrender over corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A former Thai prime minister said he
will submit to police questioning in a corruption case to share
responsibility with a member of his political party, local papers
reported Friday.
	   The corruption case tainting former Premier Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration Party involves alleged theft of funds
meant for poor farmers.
	   Adisorn Piangket, a senior member of the party, has been accused
of pocketing part of the 363 million baht (dlrs 8.85 million) that
was supposed to compensate farmers left homeless by dam
construction.
	   Adisorn said he will turn himself in and that Chavalit would go
with him, and even to jail if necessary.
	   When asked about the Oct. 14 deadline for Adisorn to appear
before police, Chavalit said: ``That's good. We will make an
appointment to face arrest,'' according to The Nation newspaper.
	   Adisorn, along with five members of the Forum of the Poor, a
grassroots organization that lobbied for the compensation, have
been summoned to give their side of the story to the police.
	   Chavalit resigned last November after public protests over his
inept handling of Thailand's economic crisis.
	   Adisorn, deputy science minister under the Chavalit's
administration, was assigned to supervise the compensation pay-outs
to farmers affected by the construction of the Rasi Salai dam in
Sisaket province, 430 kilometers (267 miles) northeast of Bangkok.
	   He is also the NAP's deputy secretary general.

Officials stand behind Canadian players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's field hockey team has
apologized and offered to pay the estimated U.S. dlrs 25 damage it
caused after a disputed loss at the Commonwealth Games.
	   The Canadian players were angered by an umpiring decision by
Scotland's David Wallis that allowed Malaysia to take a winning 2-1
lead in their match late Thursday. The Canadians surrounded the
umpire after the match and were the subject of a police report
after causing damage to their dressing room.
	   Canadian team spokeswoman Teresa Moore said the damage was minor
and was done because the players were locked out of their dressing
room and feared crowd violence.
	   A crowd of almost 20,000 pelted the playing field with bottles
after the match as the Canadians remonstrated with Wallis.
	   ``Because of the bottle throwing, the players were desperate to
get into the locker room but the door was locked shut because their
belongings were inside,'' Moore said Friday.
	   ``The goalie (Mike Mahood) ran at the door with his stick up,
there's a slight dent in the door and a sign also got knocked over.
The damage was accidental and (Mahood) wasn't a happy camper. They
definitely felt threatened by the bottle throwing.'
	   Moore said any disciplinary action was a matter for the team's
coach but added the team would stay at the village through to the
end of the Games.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, the matter is over,'' Moore said.
``We are 100 percent behind the team. It was a very unfortunate
incident and the players are contrite but every time someone does
something wrong you can't just abandon them.''
	   Moore said the team sent a staff member in to take still and
video footage of the damage done. She said stadium officials had
estimated the damage at about 100 Malaysian ringgit (about U.S.
dlrs 25).

IMF, World Bank, name Thai finance minister committee chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Development Committee of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank appointed Thai Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda its new chairman.
	   Tarrin will replace Malaysia's former Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who was sacked by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad in August. Without his official post in Malaysia, he
couldn't keep his position in the Committee.
	   The appointment prevents the key joint Committee of the two
international agencies from being without a chairman during the
annual meetings of the institutions Sept. 29-Oct. 8.
	   A focus of the meetings will be the financial crisis in Asia,
including difficulties in Thailand, which is receiving a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout from the IMF.
	   The Development Committee is scheduled to meet Oct. 5.
	   Tarrin has been Thailand's Finance Minister since November 1997
and previously held that position from October 1992 to July 1995.
	   At the same time, he has been a member of parliament since
November 1996. He holds a B.A. from Harvard University and an
M.B.A. in finance from Stanford University, which he received in
1970.
	   Officially named the ``Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards
of Governors of the Bank and the Fund on the Transfer of Real
Resources to Developing Countries,'' the group has 24 members,
mostly ministers of finance or development, who represent the full
membership of the World Bank and IMF. The group focuses
specifically on developing country issues.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's president and international
officials urged Albanians to disregard an ex-president's calls for
a nationwide protest on Friday to force the current government to
resign.
	   President Rexhep Meidani and other Western officials fear the
protest could spark unrest similar to rioting Sunday and Monday by
ex-President Sali Berisha's supporters that damaged the parliament
and prime minister's office. Three people died and scores were
injured.
	   The capital was calm early Friday morning, with little visible
police presence or other signs of impeding trouble. On previous
days, police set up road blocks later in the morning to check for
weapons.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of months of anarchy
last year after pyramid schemes collapse, cost many people their
life's savings. Berisha was president during the crisis and lost
elections in its aftermath.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha, who immediately blamed Prime
Minister Fatos Nano.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and disappointment with the government's
inability to revive the economy and restore confidence in the
nation's future.
	   A parliament commission has recommended that Berisha's immunity
from prosecution be stripped. If approved by the full parliament,
Berisha could be arrested for inciting riots aimed at toppling the
Nano's government.
	   Western diplomatic sources said Berisha's possible arrest would
likely come next week to avoid an immediate, emotional backlash
from his supporters.
	   While also appealing for calm, Berisha accused Nano, his
longtime political foe, of seeking confrontation.
	   ``Nano wants to direct the country toward civil conflict,''
Berisha said Thursday night.
	   Berisha earlier urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he
described as a Communist-style dictatorship that has killed its
enemies. The communist reference has resonance in Albania, one of
the most hard-line Communist countries of the Soviet era.
	   Western officials and many Albanians, however, consider Berisha
a power-hungry, corrupt leader interested only in personal gain.
	   For the second straight day, about 2,000 Democratic Party
supporters held a brief, peaceful protest Thursday in Tirana's
central square. Roadblocks at key intersections, where armed police
searched vehicles and people for weapons, prevented some from
joining the protest.

Jobless protesters disrupt German TV election panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ A small group of protesters disrupted a
German election TV panel late Thursday by shouting ``liar'' when
Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said the nation's jobless problem was
improving.
	   One protester held a sign in front of station ZDF cameras saying
``Bluem should now be quiet.'' Security staff for the national TV
station quickly ushered the group out of the studio.
	   The highly visible protest was unusual in a campaign that has
been otherwise tame and uneventful.
	   Unemployment, for months at postwar record highs, is a key issue
for Sept. 27 parliamentary elections. Many Germans blame Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his ruling Christian Democrats for not doing more
to solve the problem.
	   Kohl is struggling in his fight for a record fifth term against
challenger Gerhard Schroeder, the popular governor of Lower Saxony
state.

Hong Kong man jailed over heroin importation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A man from Hong Kong was sentenced
Friday to 15 years' jail after more than 9.2 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.5 million) worth of heroin was sent to him in
the mail.
	   Wing Sum Tsui, 47, who lived on the Gold Coast, pleaded guilty
in the Supreme Court to one count of importation between Oct. 18-21
last year.
	   Tsui, who was born in Guangzhou, China, lived in Hong Kong for
17 years before coming to Australia, ostensibly for a holiday in
January last year.
	   Two packages addressed to Tsui from Canton in China were
revealed to have false bottoms under X-ray at the International
Mail Handling Unit in Sydney.
	   The packages contained Asian ceramic crockery and tweed jackets,
plus 7 1/2 pounds (3.4 kilos) of heroin.
	   Prosecutor Kate McGuinness said the heroin was between 70 and 77
percent pure.
	   Tsui denied any knowledge of the heroin and said he believed the
crockery was antique and he was to pass it on to the brother of a
man he knew from Hong Kong.
	   Tsui, who worked as an assistant club manager in Hong Kong, has
no family or friends in Australia and does not speak English.
	   Justice Margaret Wilson sentenced Tsui to 15 years' jail, with
no parole considered for seven years.

Socialists poised for narrow hold on power in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Heading into national elections, Swedes
are trying to decide where their famed Middle Way is leading:
toward success or to the verge of failure.
	   After a discouraging decade in which the country suffered from
high unemployment and the fabric of its tightly knit social
services network began to unravel, the governing Social Democrats
say the worst is over and that the country's mix of socialism and
capitalism is back on track.
	   The conservative opposition, led by the Moderates party of
former prime minister Carl Bildt, says the worst is yet to come
unless Sweden abandons its high-tax ways.
	   Polls ahead of Sunday's elections show voters leaning toward the
status quo, but not with much conviction. A poll by the SIFO
organization published Friday in the national newspaper Dagens
Nyheter showed the Social Democrats attracting the most support at
36.8 percent _ far short of enough to govern alone. The Moderates
were at 24.8 percent.
	   Throughout the campaign, the graphs of support levels for the
two major parties have remained nearly flat, like the EEG of an
unhealthy patient. The real action has been among the five smaller
parties likely to win some of the 349 seats in the Riksdag
parliament.
	   The two parties at the far ends of the ideological spectrum are
surging. The Left Party, the former Communists, have nearly doubled
their current support to 11.8 percent, according to Friday's poll,
while the Christian Democrats are at 10.1 percent, a 150-percent
jump from their support in the last elections in 1994.
	   Two other non-socialist parties gathered a total of 9.7 percent
and the Greens, likely to support the Social Democrats in a new
government, polled 4.7 percent.
	   A government of the Social Democrats with support from the Left
and Greens would likely continue the policies that, according to
the OECD, make Sweden the world's most heavily taxed country: in
1997, the tax burden was more than 53 percent of gross domestic
product.
	   The high taxes support Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare benefits
and social services, but they are discouraging to businesses.
Several major Swedish companies, including telecommunications giant
LM Ericsson, the country's largest company, have threatened to move
their headquarters out of Sweden unless the business climate
improves.
	   The Swedish economy is reasonably healthy. Unemployment is at
7.3 percent, but has been falling for the past two years as Sweden
digs out of the economic crisis of the early 1990s, inflation is
virtually nil, and the country foresees a budget surplus this year.
	   But the Moderates say continuing the high taxes condemns Sweden
to being marginalized in an increasingly competitive global
economy. They propose a tax cut of 80 billion kronor (dlrs 10
billion) over three years. That would still keep Sweden's tax
burden extraordinarily high _ about 50 percent of GDP _ but would
stimulate job creation, Bildt contends.
	   Bildt has repeatedly lambasted the Social Democrats as holding
on to outmoded ideas, but the Moderates relatively low support
reflects many Swedes' resistance to allowing the cold realities of
the marketplace more power in shaping their country.
	   ``We think that solidarity is modern, and egoism is
old-fashioned,'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson characterized the
issue in a television debate this week.
	   But Sweden's taxes and the regulations that are often obstacles
to small businessmen can also be alienating to many.
	   ``The government should pay more attention to projects like
this,'' said Miguel Montoya, proprietor of an outdoor jewelry stall
on a main Stockholm square. ``I had been unemployed ... Now I feel
myself part of things.''
	   Another sign of widespread disaffection has appeared in the
pre-voting polls, where around 12 percent of the respondents have
said they are undecided _ about twice the level from previous
elections. ``They are tired, they feel frustrated,'' said analyst
Hans Alfredson of the TEMO polling organization.
	   A generally unexciting election campaign hasn't helped. Persson
and Bildt inspire little personal affection among voters. Persson
is regarded by many as being didactic and condescending, while
Bildt puts many off with his cerebral aura and sharp tongue.
	   There has been no issue that has caught fire. Bildt tried
unsuccessfully to make Sweden's hesitance to join the European
Union's single-currency program a linchpin of his contention that
Sweden has ``Europe's most pusillanimous government.''
	   But most parties from left to right either oppose the EMU or say
joining it should be put to a referendum, which surveys indicate
would fail.
	   A brief potential controversy emerged this week when Gudrun
Schyman, head of the high-tax Left Party, admitted she had failed
to report to the tax authorities some payments she made to a girl
who helped clean her house, but the issue lost steam quickly.

Myanmar military dismisses opposition parliament as ill conceived
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government on Friday
criticized an opposition committee that claims to represent the
elected parliament, but stopped short of breaking it up or
arresting members.
	   Diplomats in Yangon said they were surprised by the military's
restrained response to the establishment of the committee, as many
had expected the government would put members in jail.
	   The committee, which includes 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu Kyi, was formed Wednesday and claims to have the mandate of
195 arrested members of parliament to govern in their name.
	   ``It remains unclear which responsibilities of government this
new committee intends to take over,'' a statement from the
government said Friday. ``Under what constitution will it govern?
Will it defend Myanmar sovereignty? Will it send envoys to other
countries?''
	   Myanmar, also known, as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. Although Suu Kyi's party, the National League for
Democracy, won 82 percent of the seats in Parliament in a 1990
election, the military has never allowed the assembly to meet.
	   The government recently arrested 843 people to prevent the
opposition from convening Parliament. The military is wary,
however, of arresting NLD leaders, particularly Suu Kyi, because of
the international backlash it would provoke.
	   The government also said Friday that it found a legal
contradiction in the committee's statements.
	   The committee has proclaimed that all laws passed by the current
military government since it came to power in 1988 were invalid
because the violent takeover _ in which soldiers gunned down
thousands _ was illegal.
	   But at the same time the committee has said it was acting as
parliament until the legislature could be convened under the 1990
election law _ contradicting its statement that all post-1988 laws
are invalid.
	   ``The new committee appears to be confused even about its own
decisions,'' the government statement said.
	   ``While the NLD puzzles over these issues, the current
government will continue to shoulder the real responsibilities of
governing Myanmar,'' it said.

Shortfall in cocoa production likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite consumption being down because of Russia's
economic difficulties, production of cocoa is still likely to fall
short of demand in the coming season, according to a new assessment
released Friday.
	   The shortfall for the 1998-99 season (October-September) is
expected to be at least 150,000 tons, assuming there is no growth
in world consumption and a crop in the Ivory Coast _ the world's
biggest producer _ produces no more than 1.1 million metric tons,
E. D. &AMP; F. Man Ltd. said in its latest quarterly report on the
cocoa market.
	   ``Therefore, the 1998-99 season is likely to yield the seventh
production deficit in eight years,'' according to the London-based
commodity trader, whose revised estimate of the 1997-98 market
balance shows a record production shortfall of 220,000 tons.
	   In Man's view, the likely damage to global use of cocoa _ more
than 95 percent of which goes into chocolate and associated
confectionery and beverage products _ because of Russia's economic
crisis makes it ``unrealistic'' to expect global demand to grow
anywhere near the level of the last two years.
	   In 1996-97, it was up 3.5 percent, with this season's increase
estimated at 2.2 percent.

Parents see video of murdered woman's clothing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The mother of a murdered Japanese
tourist on Friday watched video footage of police discovering her
daughter's blood-soaked clothing at her accused killer's caravan.
	   The brutal slaying, which happened in September 1997 as
right-wing member of Parliament Pauline Hanson was campaigning
against Asian immigration, made some Asians fear for their safety
in Australia.
	   On day five of the Cairns Supreme Court murder trial of a
17-year-old man who cannot be legally named, arresting officer Det.
Sgt. Ian Thompson took the court through a video interview with the
accused.
	   He also showed a further video of the search of the accused's
house trailer which discovered a purple ``bum bag,'' blue
sleeveless shirt, black leather shorts, panties and a bra -- all
identified as belonging to the victim, Michiko Okuyama, 22.
	   The items were found in three black plastic bags stashed in a
box under three teddy bears and a framed picture of the accused
man's mother.
	   Okuyama disappeared while shopping in the city. Her body was
found in a Cairns swamp 14 days later.
	   Her parents, Toshie and Hideo Okuyama, have flown to Cairns to
watch the trial and reportedly intend to establish a permanent
memorial to their daughter.
	   The trial was adjourned until Monday.
	   The prosecutor has said evidence against the suspect included
Okuyama's blood found in a warehouse where he worked alone; that he
was seen pushing a heavily laden wheeled garbage bin which was
emitting a foul smell from the warehouse to the swamp where the
body was found; and that bloodstained clothing belonging to the
victim were found in his caravan.
	   The evidence would show that she choked on her own blood after
suffering facial fractures from being beaten with enough force to
knock out some of her teeth, he said.
	   The accused's name has been withheld on legal grounds because
was aged 16 at the time of the offense.

Daimler shareholders vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting opening, Schrempp statements. ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHARINE SCHMIDT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief executive Juergen
Schrempp told shareholders preparing to vote Friday on the
megamerger with Chrysler that their company is in better shape now
than it has been for years.
	   Operating profit doubled in the first half of 1998 to 3.8
billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue projections for 1998
have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion) to 140
billion marks (dlrs 83 billion).
	   ``With DaimlerChrysler we intend to set a new standard in
earnings power, profitable growth and in helping shape the future
of our society,'' Schrempp assured shareholders. ``In doing so, we
will secure your company's independence and strengthen its
values.''
	   Schrempp, 54, made his reputation as a defender of shareholder
value by refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by
Mercedes-Benz cars _ after his predecessor Edzard Reuter ran up
record losses by expanding into a diversified conglomerate.
	   Before shareholders vote on the merger, they'll grill Schrempp
on details of the dlrs 38 billion deal, in particular about whether
he's in for a hefty pay raise.
	   The disparity in executive pay between Germany and the United
States is a chief shareholder concern going into the vote. Some
fear Daimler managers will use the merger to raise their income.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in total compensation, compared to about dlrs 2 million for
Schrempp.
	   Some shareholders with union ties also worry about
merger-related layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no
jobs will be lost.
	   And there are concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. How, one watchdog asked, will Schrempp
and Eaton be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands separate
if, at the same time, they speak about large synergy effects from
sharing platforms and merging their purchasing?
	   Spokesmen for Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial firm,
expected the comment phase of the shareholders meeting to extend
into the night. Their only deadline: the vote on the merger must be
held before midnight.
	   With the stakes so high, thousands of shareholders thronged to a
Stuttgart arena. Chrysler shareholders also vote on the deal
Friday, but most will vote by mail or on the Internet and the
meeting in Delaware is expected to be brief.
	   Despite concerns about high U.S. salaries, analysts expect
Daimler to raise executive pay over the next few years to prevent
top performers from defecting to other companies.
	   Executives will be trying to appease shareholders' concerns
during the meeting not only to get approval for the merger, but
also to encourage voluntary participation in the stock swap.
	   Both Daimler and Chrysler want 90 percent of the shareholders to
turn in their shares for shares in the new company later this
month, although they only need 75 percent. The higher level will
enable the companies to use the more favorable ``pooling of
interests'' accounting method.
	   If less than 75 percent participate, Daimler and Chrysler said
they will have to cancel the whole deal.

WMC mining company told to leave Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Mining giant WMC Ltd. should pull
out of the Philippines because it is doing social and ecological
harm there, a delegation told the company Friday.
	   The delegation, including church officials, a mining watchdog
group and Philippine representatives, met WMC officials at the
company's Melbourne office to make their protest.
	   They delivered a report by the Mineral Policy Institute that
criticizes the social and ecological impact of the company's bid to
develop Tampakan copper mine on the Philippines island of Mindanao,
as well as a protest letter from indigenous Mindanao people.
	   The Sydney-based institute also alleges that WMC is overriding
the wishes of local people; destroying indigenous sites; leaving
behind radioactive waste; and cutting down native forests.
	   WMC also had a poor track record for injuries and inadequate
safety at its operations in Australia and in other countries
including Papua New Guinea, the report said.
	   After Friday's meeting, Philippine delegate The Rev. Avelino
Sichon accused the company of failing to consult local people, of
misusing ancestral land and of destroying the social fabric of the
area's B'Laan tribe.
	   Avelino, of the Alliance For Genuine Development in the
Philippines, representing farmers and others, said that in an area
beset by poverty, WMC was mining agricultural and forested land
belonging to the indigenous people.
	   The B'Laan people on the island numbered about 240,000, with
6,000 living in the area fenced off by WMC. They fear their
remaining virgin forest in the area will be destroyed, he said.
	   The company signed a financial and technical agreement with the
Philippines government in 1995 for the copper mining project.
	   ``They are using the water for drilling and there is the
experience of the community that they get skin disease off their
drilling activity,'' Avelino said.
	   Mining Policy Institute director Geoff Evans said his institute
was concerned about WMC operations, particularly in Mindanao,
``where their presence in that area has contributed to community
conflict.''
	   Gordon Drake, WMC's group manager for public affairs and
environment, attended the meeting and denied the accusations.
	   ``We believe we have strong community support for exploration
activities around Tampakan.
	   ``We are undertaking baseline studies on the environmental
protection of the area,'' he said.
	   He said he was not aware of the skin disease claims but would
happily look into them.
	   He said the company would examine the report.

Israel tightens West Bank closure amid warnings of Hamas attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of the Jewish New Year, Israel
resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday
amid warnings that Islamic militants were plotting to kidnap
Israeli soldiers and carry out bombings in Israeli cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   In the West Bank, Palestinians planned a mass funeral Friday for
a teen-ager shot dead the day before, apparently by a Jewish
settler. Witnesses said 17-year-old Iyad Kabasma was killed and
another teen-ager wounded when they were fired on from a car with
Israeli license plates in the village of Beitunia.
	   Later, a 35-year-old resident of the nearby Dolev settlement
turned himself in to police, saying his car was attacked by
Palestinian rock-throwers. He told police that he fired in the air,
and was not aware that anyone was hit.
	   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Hamas supporters called for a
rally after Muslim prayers at noon Friday to protest Israel's
killing of two of the group's top fugitives, Imad and Adel
Awadallah, who were shot dead by Israeli troops Sept. 11.
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the soldiers, and
army radio said there was concern that Hamas would try to kidnap
Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force Israel to release the
bodies. Israel's public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani, said
he had received ``specific warnings'' about Hamas plans to snatch
soldiers.
	   Israeli media warned of large-scale Hamas attacks in Israeli
cities. One Israeli newspaper wrote that Hamas planned to set off
car bombs in major Israeli cities. A headline in another paper
screamed, ``Hamas plans an attack like Kenya,'' referring to last
month's explosion that wrecked the American Embassy in Nairobi.
	   The army announced that a complete closure of the West Bank and
Gaza would be reimposed, starting at 4 p.m. (1400 gmt) Friday. The
restrictions, which bar all Palestinians from entering Israel, will
not be lifted before Wednesday morning, the end of the Near Year's
holiday.
	   Israel had imposed a blanket closure after the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but gradually eased it, allowing 17,000 workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.
	   Tension has risen since the killing of the Awadallah brothers.
	   Adel Awadallah was a leader of the military wing of Hamas. His
younger brother, Imad, was suspected by the Palestinian Authority
of killing another Hamas leader in a power struggle. Imad Awadallah
escaped from a Palestinian prison in Jericho last month.
	   Hamas charges that Israel and the Palestinian Authority
co-operated in allowing Imad to escape and lead Israeli forces to
his brother. Israel and the Palestinian Authority deny the charges.
	   Hamas leaders pledged revenge attacks against Israel for the
killing of the Awadallah brothers. A Hamas spokesman said the
targets would be Israeli settlers and soldiers.

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank moved Friday to help the troubled
banking system by infusing more money into the economy _ a risky
move that immediately triggered a further plunge of the ruble.
	   Russia's new government wants to make sure the country's banks
don't fail, and it also wants to pay overdue debts to state
workers. But economists have warned about the dangers of
hyperinflation if the government pumps too much money into the
economy to meet these goals. Prices soared 43 percent in the just
the first two weeks of September.
	   The Central Bank invited leading Russian banks to submit lists
of all outstanding debts and said it would lower reserve
requirements for banks in relatively sound financial position.
	   That means the banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on
hand, and could settle debts, improving the overall liquidity in
the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those treasuries had been frozen by the Central Bank in a
controversial debt restructure plan announced along with the
devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some of the treasury bills.
Kozlov wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed
it would be strictly limited.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble was down again and was nearing its all-time
low of 20 to the dollar, reached earlier this month.
	   At the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, U.S. dollars for
next-day delivery opened at 18-20 rubles in over-the-counter
trading, from 15 on Thursday.
	   ``I think it's because the Central Bank is likely to print
rubles,'' said Pyotr Neimyshev, chief trader at Chase Manhattan
Bank International.
	   Most Russian media assessed the Central Bank's move as a lesser
of two evils.
	   ``The decision made by the Central Bank is justified,'' said the
business daily Kommersant. ``Today we already have the ruble
falling and inflation, but the nation can't live without the
banking system.''
	   The non-payment crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill, including tax payments
to the federal budget. It has threatened to bring broader economic
activity to a halt if no action is taken.
	   The ruble devaluation and forced debt restructure dealt a hard
blow to Russian banks, putting many on the verge of collapse. They
have also incurred huge losses to foreign investors.
	   The government said on Thursday that a decision on debt
restructuring was being delayed until Sept. 25 to try to work out a
deal acceptable to foreign lenders.
	   Meanwhile, the composition and policies of the new Russian
cabinet remained in limbo on Friday. Adding to the confusion were
reports that a moderate lawmaker appointed deputy prime minister
had rejected the job.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov picked Vladimir Ryhkov, a deputy
speaker of the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, as his
deputy in charge of social affairs earlier this week.
	   However, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday that Ryzhkov
had rejected the job because the appointment came without
consultations with him while he was on a foreign trip.
	   Ryzhkov, a 32-year old member of the moderate, pro-government
Our Home Is Russia faction, met with Primakov early Friday.
Following the meeting, Ryzhkov locked himself up in his parliament
offices. ``No comment. I'm still thinking,'' he said over
telephone.

Austria's president divorced years after relationship with aide
</HEADLINE>
became known &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- President Thomas Klestil and his wife of
40 years have divorced four years after they separated over his
relationship with a woman co-worker.
	   The presidential office Friday confirmed a report in the Vienna
daily Kronen Zeitung that a district court had granted the divorce
decree Thursday.
	   Klestil's marital problems caused a furor when his wife, Edith,
moved out of the presidential villa on New Year's Eve 1993.
	   Widely published suggestions that his relationship with the
aide, Margot Loeffler, had caused the marital troubles rocked
Austria's normally staid political and social establishment.
	   Nevertheless, Klestil won a second, six-year term to the largely
ceremonial post during elections in April, defeating four
challengers with 63 percent of the vote.
	   Despite his marital problems, Klestil, a career diplomat, is
widely credited with helping restore Austria's credibility, which
was damaged by the controversy over the Nazi German wartime service
of his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim.
	   Klestil's office said in a statement there would be no further
comment on the court action because ``the president sees this as a
private matter.''

New chairman for Credit Suisse from 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss banking group Credit Suisse
said Friday it has chosen chief executive Lukas Muehlemann as its
new chairman.
	   The banking giant said Muehlemann will be nominated to the board
of directors for approval by shareholders in 2000.
	   He will then be appointed as chairman, to succeed Rainer E. Gut,
who has previously said he would retire from that post.
	   Gut will succeed Helmut Maucher as chairman of food and drinks
group Nestle in 2000.
	   Muehlemann, who was the subject of false rumors that he would
resign amid the current turmoil, will retain his position as chief
executive officer.
	   The bank said earlier this month that global financial market
turmoil, most notably in Russia, will affect the group's operating
results in the second half. But Muehlemann said then that Credit
Suisse didn't have any plans to withdraw from Russia and other
countries experiencing economic problems.
	   The group's net profit rose 36 percent to 2.4 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 1.7 billion) during the first half of this year.

Japanese stock prices stage moderate rebound, dollar falls

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rebounded moderately Friday,
recovering some of the losses from the previous day when Tokyo's
main stock index plunged to a 12-year closing low. The U.S. dollar
fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.98 points,
or 0.89 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,983.12. The rise
followed a 2.38 percent decline on Thursday, when the Nikkei closed
at 13,859.14, down 338.56 points.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 132.10, down 2.20 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 132.18 late in
New York overnight. The dollar ranged from 131.05 yen to 132.68 yen
in Friday's trading.
	   On the stock market, traders said public funds were looking for
bargains.
	   Investors were hopeful Japan's ruling and opposition parties
would reach a compromise on banking reform in time for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States next week, they
said.
	   ``It is questionable whether banking bills created out of a
compromise will effectively stabilize the financial industry,''
said Masaaki Higashida, deputy general manager at Nomura Securities
Co.
	   Share prices started lower after a steep overnight fall on Wall
Street but later moved into positive territory as players made
adjustments ahead of the weekend, traders said.
	   After the market closed, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
the main opposition parties reached a final compromise on details
of the bills, such as how to address the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   LTCB shares, the most actively traded issue Friday, fell briefly
to an all-time low of 18 yen (14 cents) late afternoon amid
continued uncertainties about the bank's future. LTBC stocks closed
at 19 yen (14 cents) per share, the same as the previous low set on
Monday.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 453 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Thursday's 411 million
shares. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 750 to 400, with 138
issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 4.16 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,073.22. On
Thursday, the TOPIX closed down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to
1,069.06.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was weak following renewed falls in U.S.
and Latin American share prices.
	   The dollar remained under selling pressure as some Japanese
businesses began selling the U.S. currency for yen to bring money
home and beef up their balance sheets before the end of the fiscal
half-year on Sept. 30.
	   Also hurting the dollar was the lingering speculation about a
possible U.S. interest rate cut, traders said. Lower rates hurt a
country's currency by lowering returns for investors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.675 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.665 percent,
driving its price down to 115.51 from 115.60 yen.

Kiwis win cricket bronze medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Allrounder Chris Harris and
spinner Daniel Vettori led New Zealand to the first Commonwealth
Games cricket bronze medal Friday with a 51-run win over Sri Lanka.
	   Harris belted an unbeaten 55, including five sixes, to lift New
Zealand to 212 for seven off 50 overs. Sri Lanka suffered a middle
order collapse, as Vettori claimed three wickets for 13 in six
overs, and were bowled out for 161 in the 45th over.
	   The Kiwis bounced back from a dismal performance against
Australia in the semifinal, where they were dismissed for 58 and
lost by nine wickets.
	   ``I'm very happy with our win. We're absolutely rapt,
especically after we played such a horrible game yesterday,'' said
captain Stephen Fleming.
	   Opener Nathan Astle led the way with 56 off 84 balls before he
was run out, but it was Harris' intervention that helped increase
the run rate.
	   He started cautiously but ended in a rush. His final six came
off the second ball of a final over costing 17 runs. It took him to
50 and pushed the Kiwis over 200.
	   The runs were timely for the Kiwis, who had let things slip away
after a solid start by Astle and Fleming, who added 85 for the
second wicket.
	   Harris was particularly harsh on off-spinner Tilan Samaraweera,
while Alex Tait also weighed in with a six in the last over.
	   Sri Lanka, playing without test stars Sanath Jayasuriya and
Aravinda de Silva, struggled with the bat. Opener Avishka
Gunawardene made 30 before he was bowled by Vettori, and Chandika
Hathurusinghe made 34, but the Sri Lankans slumped to 77 for seven.
	   Established test star Hashan Tillakaratne also failed, making
just eight before giving Vettori a third scalp.
	   ``To restrict them to 200 is not a bad effort but again we
batted badly,'' said Tillakaratne.
	   Vettori did the major damage and his three-wicket burst ruined
Sri Lanka's medal chances. The teen-ager finished with 3-33.
	   Lower order batsman Suresh Perera swung hard late in the innings
for 45 but he was the last man out, bowled by Harris, who finished
with 2-20.
	   Australia and South Africa will play for the gold medal on
Saturday.

	   BEIJING _ The government is tightening controls of China's
unruly futures markets in an attempt to curb speculative trading
and prevent riots among clients cheated out of their money.
	   This week, market regulators closed 12 brokerages for trading
violations, bringing the number of closures this year to more than
20.
	   Among the companies closed down was Champion Futures, a
brokerage based in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong
Kong, whose top executives have since gone missing, as has 50
million yuan (dlrs 6 million) in company funds.
	   Angry clients of Champion Futures attempted to storm its offices
Thursday, demanding their money back.
	   Company employees said that although the company was insolvent,
it had continued to accept new clients in order to pay old clients
and debts.
	   The futures markets are viewed by many market watchers as the
epitome of what's wrong with Chinese capitalism: rampant
speculation, commonplace corruption and mostly absent regulators.
	   To prevent the situation from getting further out of hand, the
China Securities Regulatory Commission is moving ahead with a
massive merger of the country's futures exchanges.
	   The merger, which was announced in August and is to take place
by the end of the year, will involve trimming the current 14
futures exchanges to just three, and closing all but 12 of 35
futures contracts.

	   NEW DELHI, India _ Some of India's struggling cellular phone
companies will have five more years to pay license fees they owe
the government, the minister for information and telecommunications
said Friday.
	   But the extension from 10 to 15 years will apply only to
companies doing business outside the main Indian cities of Bombay,
Calcutta, Madras and New Delhi, Minister Sushma Swaraj told
reporters. And the companies may have to pay more, she said.
	   License fees vary widely and are based on the bids the company
offered to win the contract.
	   Twenty-three cell phone companies, all of them Indian-foreign
partnerships, entered the market with high hopes, estimating
revenue per subscriber at around 2,500 rupees (dlrs 59) per month
and offering correspondingly high fees to the government. But
revenues turned out to be less than 1,000 rupees per month,
according to the Cellular Operators Association of India.
	   India's telecommunications sector was opened to private
providers in 1994, ending a five-decade-old government monopoly.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The Development Committee of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank appointed Thai Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda its new chairman.
	   Tarrin will replace Malaysia's former Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who was sacked by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad in August. Without his official post in Malaysia, he
couldn't keep his position in the Committee.
	   The appointment prevents the key joint Committee of the two
international agencies from being without a chairman during the
annual meetings of the institutions Sept. 29-Oct. 8.
	   A focus of the meetings will be the financial crisis in Asia,
including difficulties in Thailand, which is receiving a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout from the IMF.
	   The Development Committee is scheduled to meet Oct. 5.
	   Tarrin has been Thailand's Finance Minister since November 1997
and previously held that position from October 1992 to July 1995.
	   At the same time, he has been a member of parliament since
November 1996. He holds a B.A. from Harvard University and an
M.B.A. in finance from Stanford University, which he received in
1970.
	   Officially named the ``Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards
of Governors of the Bank and the Fund on the Transfer of Real
Resources to Developing Countries,'' the group has 24 members,
mostly ministers of finance or development, who represent the full
membership of the World Bank and IMF. The group focuses
specifically on developing country issues.

	   TOKYO _ Washington is ``deeply concerned'' about a huge Japanese
trade surplus that threatens to raise ``a protectionist backlash''
in the United States, U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
said Friday.
	   Eizenstat, visiting Tokyo with Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, said the United States' deficit with Japan is likely to
hit a historic high this year and urged the government to move
quickly to boost the economy and make the nation less dependent on
overseas markets.
	   ``It is critical that Japan's recovery be, as the government of
Japan itself has insisted, domestic demand-led, not export-led,''
he told reporters in Tokyo.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan was expected to soar to nearly
dlrs 70 billion this year.
	   Japan's Asian neighbors have been devastated by an economic
meltdown that has driven leading companies into bankruptcy and
plunged millions into poverty. Economists say the only way out of
the slump is for Asian nations to take advantage of their
drastically devalued currencies to increase export sales.
	   Early in the crisis _ now more than a year old _ it was hoped
Japan would lead the recovery, but the world's second largest
economy has itself slipped into recession.
	   Eizenstat said, earlier this week, the United States would do
its best to promote recovery by buying products from struggling
Asian nations, but he called on Japan to get its economy back on
track so it could help.
	    &UR; ___
	   SINGAPORE _ U.S.-based Mobil Corp. announced Friday it will
enter a joint venture with the Singapore government to construct a
dlrs 800 million petrochemical facility.
	   The venture with the Economic Development Board _ a division of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry _ is for a naphtha-based
ethylene cracker facility to be constructed adjacent to the
company's existing refinery complex.
	   The new facility will produce 800,000 metric tons (880,000 short
tons) per year of ethylene and 440,000 metric tons (484,000 short
tons) per year of propylene.
	   The company said in a press release that Mobil Oil Singapore
will have an 80 percent stake in the facility, while the Economic
Development Board would take 20 percent.
	   The statement added that the new facility is not expected to
begin operations before 2003 because prolonged discussions on
agreements with possible customers of the refinery's output are
anticipated, due to Asia's economic slowdown.
	   Mobil added that discussions were under way with potential
customers, which will convert the facility's output into products
such as polyethylene, ethylene glycol, polypropylene, propylene
oxide, styrene monomer, elastomers and phenol.
	   The planned facility will ``provide petrochemicals at a very
competitive cost to Asian markets,'' Mobil Chemical president
Raymond McGowan said in the release.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines _ While the government tried to broker a
last-minute deal to keep Philippine Airlines in business, two
smaller carriers were grounded Friday in another severe blow to the
country's airline industry.
	   Regulators said they suspended the operating certificate for Air
Philippines, the country's second-largest airline, for failure to
comply with safety standards. Grand International Airways, a
smaller carrier, canceled its flights because of unpaid insurance
and fuel bills, employees said.
	   The shutdowns and the scheduled closure next week of Philippine
Airlines pose a potentially devastating threat to the country,
leaving many areas of the sprawling archipelago of 7,000 islands
without air service.
	   The president of PAL's flight attendants' union, Roberto
Anduiza, called PAL's decision Thursday to close down ``an economic
disaster of national proportions.'' He said the union would be
willing to make sacrifices to prevent a closure.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it decided to shut down next
Wednesday because its rebuilding efforts were no longer viable
following its unions' refusal to accept a management-proposed
rescue plan.
	    &UR; ___
	   ADELAIDE, Australia _ The Asian financial crisis was set to
continue for at least a couple of years and could last for up to a
decade, Australian Labor Party opposition leader Kim Beazley said
Friday.
	   Beazley told the South Australian Press Club that Australia must
continue its dealings with the region despite the downturn.
	   ``While I don't think the problems are going to go away anytime
in the next couple of years, in the next five or 10 they probably
will,'' Beazley said.
	   ``Despite the difficulties in the region it is still a good
region to have that relationship with.''

Daimler shareholders vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schrempp comment on executive pay, minor edits to
trim &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHARINE SCHMIDT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief executive Juergen
Schrempp told shareholders preparing to vote Friday on the
megamerger with Chrysler that their company is in better shape now
than it has been for years.
	   Operating profit doubled in the first half of 1998 to 3.8
billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue projections for 1998
have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion) to 140
billion marks (dlrs 83 billion).
	   ``With DaimlerChrysler we intend to set a new standard in
earnings power, profitable growth and in helping shape the future
of our society,'' Schrempp assured shareholders. ``In doing so, we
will secure your company's independence and strengthen its
values.''
	   Schrempp, 54, made his reputation as a defender of shareholder
value by refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by
Mercedes-Benz cars _ after his predecessor Edzard Reuter ran up
record losses by expanding into a diversified conglomerate.
	   Before shareholders vote on the merger, they'll grill Schrempp
on details of the dlrs 38 billion deal, in particular about whether
he's in for a hefty pay raise.
	   Schrempp, however, evaded the issue under questioning from
reporters before the meeting opened.
	   ``The executive pay will be determined by the market,'' he said.
``I am waiting for the new management board to decide on that.''
	   The disparity in executive pay between Germany and the United
States is a chief shareholder concern going into the vote. Some
fear Daimler managers will use the merger to raise their income.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in total compensation, compared to about dlrs 2 million for
Schrempp.
	   Shareholders with union ties also worry about merger-related
layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no jobs will be
lost.
	   And there are concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. How, one watchdog asked, will Schrempp
and Eaton be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands separate
if, at the same time, they speak about large synergy effects from
sharing platforms and merging their purchasing?
	   Spokesmen for Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial firm,
expected the comment phase of the shareholders meeting to extend
into the night. Their only deadline: the vote on the merger must be
held before midnight.
	   With the stakes so high, thousands of shareholders thronged to a
Stuttgart arena. Chrysler shareholders also vote on the deal
Friday, but most will vote by mail or on the Internet and the
meeting in Delaware is expected to be brief.
	   Daimler executives will be trying to appease shareholders'
concerns during the meeting not only to get approval for the
merger, but also to encourage voluntary participation in the stock
swap.
	   Both Daimler and Chrysler want 90 percent of the shareholders to
turn in their shares for shares in the new company later this
month, although they only need 75 percent. The higher level will
enable the companies to use the more favorable ``pooling of
interests'' accounting method.
	   If less than 75 percent participate, Daimler and Chrysler said
they will have to cancel the whole deal.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with breakthrough, comments by opposition leader &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to break an embarrassing deadlock ahead of
his visit to the United States next week, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi bowed to opposition party demands Friday on a crucial set of
bills on how to bail out Japan's debt-laden banks.
	   ``They accepted our offer,'' Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic
Party, the largest opposition bloc in Parliament, told reporters
after a meeting with Obuchi and top government and ruling party
officials.
	   Kan refused to give details of that offer. Obuchi continued to
hold talks with the leaders of other opposition parties and had no
immediate comment.
	   The breakthrough follows marathon negotiations through the night
Thursday, which were called off at 5 a.m. local time after
lawmakers failed to reach an agreement.
	   Under intense pressure from abroad and from the Japanese voters,
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to pass the
bills through Parliament to speed the cleanup of the banking
industry's bad loans.
	   But the opposition, which controls enough seats in the upper
house of Japan's bicameral legislature to block the bills, has
demanded several significant changes.
	   One of the biggest points of contention was curtailing the
powers of Japan's mighty Finance Ministry. The opposition said it
would only agree to the bills if they included measures giving
oversight of financial markets from the ministry to some new
finance committee.
	   The talks also stalled over the use of public money to bail out
ailing banks. LDP proposals called for bailing out banks before
they fail to engineer a ``soft landing'' and avoid shocks to the
financial system.
	   Kan called that an irresponsible use of taxpayer funds, saying
the government should only step in after banks fail to protect
depositors and healthy borrowers.
	   Kan had also demanded greater disclosure of a failed bank's
financial records, the resignation of executives and writing off as
many bad loans as possible using stockholders' capital before
introducing taxpayers' money.
	   These issues came to a head over the LDP proposal to use public
money to bail out the cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank, one of
the nation's largest lenders.
	   Japanese newspapers reported the two sides were nearing an
agreement to nationalize the bank while its bad loans are sold off
_ effectively proclaiming it bankrupt.
	   Obuchi wanted an agreement Friday because he is to meet
President Clinton Tuesday in New York.
	   Top U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, who visited Tokyo this week, have criticized Japan for
dragging its feet and not doing more to revive its economy and ease
the economic crisis in Asia.
	   The impasse over the bills has roiled world financial markets by
stirring fears that Japan will not be able to pull itself out of
its worst recession in 50 years.

	   Anwar appears to be making the most of his time. Over the past
three days, he has called for a corruption investigation against
Mahathir. He has also accused Mahathir of fearing for his own
dwindling popularity and firing him because Anwar was the best
political alternative to Mahathir.
	   ``I slogged day and night for him. I didn't challenge him,''
said Anwar.
	   ``I feared opposing him,'' he said. ``But now I'm battling
him.''
	   Anwar called on police to be fair in their investigation of
himself, his family and his friends. And police must do the same
with Mahathir, his sons and his family, he said.
	   Such comments about Mahathir are unheard of in Malaysia, where
even opposition parties do not demand the prime minister step down.
	   ``What has he done for the downtrodden?'' Anwar said of
Mahathir, mocking the prime minister's pride in building the
world's tallest building in the capital.

Premier says don't rush tobacco sponsorship ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia should not try to end
tobacco sponsorship of Formula One motor racing ahead of the rest
of the world, Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said Friday.
	   Kennett said the sport was international and Australia should be
in step with the proposed ban, due from 2006.
	   ``I think if the world is moving towards that target date, then
we should be part of it,'' he said. ``I don't think we should argue
against it. On the other hand, I don't know that there is much
value in us trying to do something different from the world because
the sport is international.''
	   ``You're not going to be able to run this event with different
continents having different rules.''
	   The Age newspaper reported Friday that tobacco advertising at
the Melbourne race would be banned in a deal between state and
federal governments to be announced next week, and effective after
2000.
	   Grand Prix Corporation chairman Ron Walker said he would not
comment until federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge had
announced a deal.
	   Asked whether he could confirm the story he said: ``It's up to
the minister to make an announcement about it.''
	   ``I can't give you the date that it'll happen, but it'll happen
some time in the future.''
	   A spokesman at Wooldridge's office refused to confirm or deny
details in the story.
	   Wooldridge has been a long-time campaigner for the abolition of
cigarette advertising in sports, and has reportedly pushed for
Australia to bring in the ban before the rest of the world.
	   Formula One's governing body, the Federation Internationale de
L'Automobile, has agreed to phase out tobacco sponsorship of
Formula One by 2006 and will look for other forms of sponsorship.

Canadians win two shooting golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with trap shooting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadians won two gold medals
Friday in shooting events at the Commonwealth Games, including the
difficult full-bore rifle competition at distances of 300 to 1,000
yards.
	   Jim Paton won the full-bore event and Metodi Igorov took gold in
the men's rapid fire pistol competition on Langkawi Island.
	   New Zealand's Stephen Petterson, who won two golds in small-bore
rifle shooting in the 1994 games, scored highest in the men's free
rifle prone event.
	   Malaysia's Nurul Baharin won the women's air rifle shooting.
	   Paton, a 41-year-old liquor store manager, built his lead at the
shorter distances of 300, 500 and 600 yards, and then matched the
best scores at 900 and 1,000 yards, scoring 402 points. He had won
the separate Commonwealth shooting championships last November with
402.53.
	   Malaysia's Zainal Md Zain and England's Andy Luckman both shot
400, but Zainal won the silver on countback. Zainal said wind
affected the long-distance shooting.
	   Igorov, a 39-year-old native of Bulgaria, won the rapid fire
pistol with 580 points, six ahead of silver medalist Allan McDonald
of South Africa and seven ahead of bronze medalist Bhanwar Dhaka of
India.
	   Petterson beat David Moore of the Isle of Man 697.4 to 696.6 for
the gold in free rifle shooting. South African Gavin van Rhyn took
the bronze with 694.1.
	   In the women's air rifle shooting, Baharin won with 494.8,
followed by Canada's Sharon Bowes with 493.3 and England's Louise
Minett with 491.7.

Akebono wins for 5-1 five-way lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hawaiian-born yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono was
stable and quick in his latest victory for a five-way lead at 5-1
Friday, the sixth day of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Also in the lead are yokozuna brothers Takanohana and
Wakanohana, ozeki Musashimaru and No. 6-maegashira (senior
wrestler) Tochinonada.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, bulldozed out No. 2 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Kotonowaka (3-3) with powerful hand thrusts.
	   Wakanohana pulled No. 2 maegashira Minatofuji (0-5) by the arm,
sending the opponent falling on his stomach.
	   Takanohana, Wakanohana's younger brother, pushed out No. 3
maegashira Asahiyutaka (2-4) after locking him from both sides.
	   Ozeki (champion) Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii,
gave a couple of hand thrusts at No. 3-maegashira Tamakasuga's
neck, pushing him out. Tamakasuga is 1-5.
	   Ozeki Takanonami was pushed to the ringside but quickly turned
around to shove out No. 1 maegashira Tochiazuma (1-5).
	   Tochinonada shoved out No. 11-ranked Ganyu (4-2).
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, was slapped down by No. 9 maegashira Gojoro (3-3)
to suffer his fourth defeat against two wins.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, slapped down No. 9-ranked Dewataira (1-5) for his fourth
victory against two defeats.
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, shoved
out No. 11-ranked Otsukasa (3-3), improving his record to 2-4.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu
(2-1), or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, pushed down No. 5-ranked
Kasuganishiki. The No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda
from Brazil, pushed out No. 22-ranked Kyokuryuzan, also for 2-1.
	   In the second-highest junior division of sandanme, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, tripped No. 8-ranked
Tatsukabuto for a 2-1. No. 33-ranked Azumakaze, or Brazilian
Tussato Giuliano Kotinda, was pushed out by No. 30-ranked Raido,
and still winless.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Ukrainian president goes to Moscow for low-key meeting with
</HEADLINE>
Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had hoped
for a broad summit with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin here in
Ukraine, with large government delegations taking part to discuss
bilateral ties.
	   Instead, Kuchma is traveling to Moscow on Friday for a low-key
session with Yeltsin, to be held behind closed doors at a Russian
presidential residence outside Moscow.
	   The economic crisis in Russia is keeping Yeltsin occupied and
``does not provide for travels,'' Kuchma said Thursday. The summit
had originally been planned for the Ukrainian industrial town of
Kharkiv.
	   Instead of a range of mutual cooperation issues, the meeting is
to focus on Russia's economic crisis, its effects on neighboring
Ukraine and the formation of a new government in Moscow, Kuchma
said.
	   ``What road Russia takes in the future, what economic policies
the new government adopts in its program _ all that will
significantly influence the situation in Ukraine,'' he said.
	   The Russian crisis has put heavy pressure on Ukraine, a fellow
Slav nation of 50 million people. The hryvna currency went down
from 2.1 in mid-August to 2.94 Thursday as the government was
forced to expand its currency fluctuation band, and investors have
been leaving the shaky Ukrainian market.
	   Russia's financial downfall also is affecting Ukrainian exports.
Ukraine annually exports to Russia more than dlrs 10 billion worth
of commodities, or a third of its total exports, and these exports
were decreasing even before the crisis.
	   Kuchma, speaking in Kiev, said he would bring to Moscow a
far-reaching proposal for the creation of a free trade zone between
the two countries and other former Soviet republics instead of the
inefficient customs union set up by several ex-Soviet nations.
That, he said, would be ``the best way out'' of the crisis.
	   But Ukrainian media remained skeptical, pointing out that Russia
was not likely to open its market to the relatively cheap Ukrainian
goods.
	   Ukrainian officials say the sides still might discuss their
ambitious plan for economic cooperation signed in February. The
Russian side is likely to raise several painful questions, such as
that of Ukraine's debt for Russian natural gas and the issue of
Russian naval bases in Ukraine.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong slumped for the
second straight session Friday, pushed down by a sharp fall
overnight on Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 130.61 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 7,445.96. On
Thursday, the index had tumbled 284.11 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.39 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
562 million), down from Thursday's 4.88 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 625 million).
	   Brokers attributed the slump largely to the tumble on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 216.01, points,
or 2.7 percent, to close at 7873.77.
	   They said market sentiment was also damped by the government's
announcement on Thursday that the territory's unemployment rate
rose to a new 15-year high of 5 percent in the three-month period
ending Aug. 31.
	   ``The market was bullish'' earlier this week amid hopes of a
U.S. interest rate cut, said Philip Niem, an analyst with HSBC
Securities. But these hopes have been dashed by U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent comments.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 85 Hong Kong
cents to 24.05, and Cheung Kong fell 20 cents to 32.70.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.50 dollars to
137.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 80 cents to 45.80.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 80 cents to 22.00, and Hong
Kong Telecom fell 5 cents to 14.75.

Former top tax collector arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A former top government tax collector
was indicted Friday on charges of collecting illegal funds from
businessmen to help bankroll the then-ruling party's presidential
campaign last year.
	   Lim Chae-ju, then head of the National Tax Administration, used
threats of tax audits to collect dlrs 4.4 million from Daewoo,
Hyundai, SK and five other South Korean big businesses last
October, prosecutors said.
	   Lim, who was arrested Friday, handed the money over to the Grand
National Party, which at the time was the ruling party, they said.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, a lifelong opposition leader, won the
December election, becoming the country's first dissident leader to
take power.
	   Kim soon began punishing campaign irregularities. A former head
of the government spy agency is now on trial on charges of trying
to destroy Kim's election bid by depicting him as a dangerous
communist.
	   Also Friday, prosecutors said they would seek a warrant to
arrest opposition lawmaker Suh Sang-mook, who has been accused of
asking Lim to raise secret funds to finance the presidential bid of
the then-government candidate Lee Hoi-chang.
	   Lee, president of the now No. 1 opposition Grand National Party,
has denied any involvement.
	   Lee's party accused Kim of using the prosecutors' investigation
to break up the large opposition party. Eight of its members are
being investigated on bribery charges. Prosecutors deny their
investigation is politically motivated.

U.S. ambassador pledges to find killers of Peace Corps volunteer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Steven Pifer pledged Friday
to work with Ukrainian authorities to find those responsible for
the death of an American Peace Corps volunteer killed in Ukraine.
	   Victor Verloo, 64, of Sacramento, California, was found dead at
his home in the northern Ukrainian town of Chernihiv last Monday.
Police and the U.S. embassy said he was apparently killed during a
robbery.
	   ``I am very saddened by this senseless death and extend the
sympathy of our entire U.S. Embassy to his family,'' Pifer said in
a statement. ``The U.S. Embassy is working with Ukrainian
authorities to bring justice in this case.''
	   Peace Corps officials said Verloo, a native of Belgium, worked
for the California Department of Transportation before arriving in
the former Soviet republic in February. He was sworn in as a
volunteer in April and worked as a business development adviser in
Chernihiv.
	   ``He approached his role as a volunteer with enthusiasm and a
desire to bring real expertise to the people in Ukraine,'' said
Peace Corps director Mark Gearan. ``Our prayers and thoughts go out
to his family, and we pledge to do all we can to help authorities
bring his killers to justice.''
	   Police have launched a massive investigation, but have released
few details. The daily Segodnya reported that police have arrested
two women aged 28 and 38, suspected of being linked to the killing,
and were looking for the actual killer, identified as a 33-year-old
who had served prison terms for robbery, theft and extortion.
	   The Peace Corps organization has 6,500 volunteers doing charity
work in 80 countries. There are 170 currently serving in Ukraine.
	   Pifer said the case must not harm relations between the two
countries.
	   ``Tragic though it is, we will not allow this incident to mar
relations between Americans and Ukrainians,'' he said. ``We know
that Ukrainians join in our sorrow, and are committed to continuing
in our strong partnership.''
	   Verloo is survived by his son and daughter, his mother, his
former wife and two grandchildren.

General election set to be held on May 26, 1999: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has set May
26 as the tentative date for parliamentary elections, which will be
held under new democratic electoral laws, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Bisnis Indonesia quoted Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid as
saying the government hoped the new laws would be in place by
December and that elections may be held May 26.
	   According to Syarwan, drafts of the new bills, including
regulations on elections, political parties and the composition of
new legislative bodies, would be submitted to Parliament soon for
debate.
	   Originally, the government had planned to have done this by
August.
	   The opposition has criticized the delay, saying it was designed
to give extra time to the ruling Golkar party, which supports
President B.J. Habibie, to reorganize itself.
	   The new laws are expected to be enacted by the People's
Consultative Assembly at a special meeting on Nov. 10.
	   The 1,000-member assembly is made up of members of Parliament
along with government appointees and is Indonesia's highest
lawmaking body.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and protests forced
former autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32 years in
power.
	   Under Suharto, the political system was tightly controlled. Only
three political parties were permitted and their policies and
candidates all needed government approval.
	   Habibie has promised greater democratic freedom. So far more
than 50 political parties have been set up.
	   After the parliamentary election are held, the assembly is
scheduled to meet against and select a president before the end of
1999. Habibie has said he plans to stand again for office.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's deeply divided cycling
team was torn apart Friday when world champion Lucy Tyler-Sharman
was kicked out of the Commonwealth Games for criticizing team
management.
	   While Australian chef de mission Don Stockins acted swiftly to
expel Tyler-Sharman, Canadian officals stood ``100 percent'' behind
their field hockey players, who were involved in ugly scenes after
a disputed loss Thursday.
	   The dramas overshadowed early competition on Day 8 Friday, which
was in a lull following the excitement of swimming and the
100-meter men's track race a day earlier.
	   Tyler-Sharman,a former American rider who moved to Australia in
1991, was one of three leading Australian riders in conflict with
head coach Charlie Walsh's methods before the World Championship in
Bordeaux, France, last month.
	   She accused team officials of sabotaging her bike after both
feet came out of the pedals during her semifinal Thursday night.
	   The latest drama cost Tyler-Sharman her chance to ride for
bronze in Friday night's finals, and further embarrassed a cycling
outfit dubbed Team Tabloid for its constant squabbling and bitter
infighting.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' Stockins said.
	   Canada's hockey players were the subject of a police report
after causing minor damage to their locker room following their 2-1
loss to Malaysia. Spokeswoman Teresa Moore said the players had
made a full apology and offered to cover the estimated U.S. dlrs 25
cost to repair a damaged door.
	   She said the team, which angrily confronted Scottish umpire
David Wallis after his decision allowed Malaysia's late winner,
only caused the damage because they were locked out of the dressing
room and were scared of the crowd. The fans had rained bottles on
to the field at the finish.
	   The hosts were also involved in controversy at the boxing ring
Friday when English light flyweight Gary Jones went down 15-11 to
local fighter Sapok Biki in their semifinal.
	   ``I thought I won it and at the end of the day I've been robbed
of a gold medal,'' said Jones. ``He was nowhere near as good as
me.''
	   Malaysia picked up its fifth gold medal Friday when Nurul Huda
Baharin won the women's individual air rifle event at Langkawi
Island. She scored 494.8 points to win from Sharon Bowes of Canada
(493.3) and Louise Minett of England (491.7).
	   Canada's James Paton won the men's individual full-bore rifle
gold medal with 402 points. Malaysia's Zainal Abidin Md Zain took
the silver with 400 and Andrew Luckman of England collected the
bronze, also with 400.
	   Canadian Metodi Igorov added a gold in the the men's rapid fire
pistol competition while New Zealand's Stephen Petterson, who won
two golds in small-bore rifle shooting in the 1994 games, won
another in the men's free rifle prone event.
	   New Zealand also won the first medal on offer in cricket at the
Commonwealth Games when it beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs in the bronze
medal playoff.
	   Allrounder Chris Harris was the star with an unbeaten 55 in the
Kiwis 212-7 off 50 overs and took two wickets as Sri Lanka was all
out for 161 in the 45th. Australia will play South Africa for the
gold Saturday.
	   England claimed three gold and three silver medals in the
85-kilogram weightlifting division. Leon Griffin won two golds in
the overall and clean and jerk sections and silver in the snatch.
Stephen Ward had the snatch gold and silver in the other two
sections.
	   England's three weightlifting golds and Canada's two in shooting
moved them to 19 and 16 respectively, behind runaway leader
Australia on 50.
	   The third night of track and field finals was expected to suffer
a letdown after Thursday's men's 100-meter title, won by Trinidad
and Tobago's Ato Boldon in 9.88 seconds.
	   Welsh pair Iwan Thomas and Jamie Baulch were to tussle for the
400-meter title, and were expected to take the final more seriously
than they did the semi, when the pair held a conversation down the
stretch.

Unusual scorers raise eyebrows, win admiration at cricket

 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chinese and cricket?
	   The two have rarely mixed. But four Chinese women found
themselves as scorers at the six venues for Commonwealth Games
cricket competition, along with five Indians and a Eurasian.
	   Over the past 10 days, Tracy Jones, Coreen Pong, Mandy Choo and
Vivien Geh soldiered from the sidelines to trace the progress and
downfall of budding and famous cricketers: Sachin Tendulkar of
India, Curtly Ambrose of Antigua, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe and
Nathan Astle of New Zealand to name a few.
	   ``We had butterflies in our stomach when we were first asked to
do the job, wondering whether we can do it,'' said Jones.
	   ``But we did it,'' said the scorer, who often worked dressed in
whites and a straw hat, evoking visions of ladies and gentlemen at
cricket grounds during the British colonial days when the game was
brought to Malaysia.
	   Until a few years ago, the four were typical of the 6.3 million
ethnic Chinese of Malaysia: they had no idea what cricket was. That
changed a few years ago when they met their boyfriends and future
spouses, all fanatic cricket players.
	   Unwilling to be away from the men while they played cricket on
weekends, the women decided to go along and watch.
	   ``I said to myself what a stupid game. People are running here
and there and then one person walks out. `What is this?' I
thought,'' said Choo.
	   But with a few more innings under their belt, the women became
intersted. Keeping score for cricket clubs was the next step.
	   ``Now we love the game,'' said Choo, whose boyfriend is a Malay,
one of the few members of the dominant Malay and Chinese
communities of Malaysia to play the game, which is popular mostly
with the ethnic Indian minority.
	   Geh's boyfriend is an Australian, Pong's an ethnic Chinese and
Jones' husband is an Englishman from Hong Kong.
	   For Jones, there was no option but to get involved in cricket.
	   ``That was David's marriage contract. `If you want to marry me
you must marry cricket,''' said Jones, speaking jokingly about her
husband, who works in Malaysia.
	   Jones, who played netball for Malaysia, is now considered one of
the best cricket scorers in Malaysia. She and the others took a
test for the scorers' certificate awarded by England's Association
of Cricket Umpires and Scorers.
	   In the press box during a preliminary India-Canada match,
phrases like caught-and-bowled, leg-before-wicket and leg-byes
rolled off easily from Jones' tongue as a group of Pakistani
officials watched open-mouthed.
	   The Chinese scorers even taught a thing or two to cricket
journalists. In a rain-interrupted match, the team batting second
was given a higher run target to win, something that many reporters
derided as a wacky decision unheard of in regular cricket.
	   Not so, explained Jones. The higher target is reached from a
newly devised Duckworth/Lewis formula that accurately takes into
account the overs bowled, fall of wickets, runs from the first
innings and the number of penalized overs.
	   For their dedication, Jones and Pong won the greatest prize in
their profession: they will tally the scores at Saturday's gold
medal game between Australia and South Africa.

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another first deputy prime minister named in new
final graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank moved Friday to help the troubled
banking system by infusing more money into the economy _ a risky
move that immediately triggered a further plunge of the ruble.
	   Russia's new government wants to make sure the country's banks
don't fail, and it also wants to pay overdue debts to state
workers. But economists have warned about the dangers of
hyperinflation if the government pumps too much money into the
economy to meet these goals. Prices soared 43 percent in the just
the first two weeks of September.
	   The Central Bank invited leading Russian banks to submit lists
of all outstanding debts and said it would lower reserve
requirements for banks in relatively sound financial position.
	   That means the banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on
hand, and could settle debts, improving the overall liquidity in
the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those treasuries had been frozen by the Central Bank in a
controversial debt restructure plan announced along with the
devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some of the treasury bills.
Kozlov wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed
it would be strictly limited.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble was down again and was nearing its all-time
low of 20 to the dollar, reached earlier this month.
	   At the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, U.S. dollars for
next-day delivery opened at 18-20 rubles in over-the-counter
trading, from 15 on Thursday.
	   ``I think it's because the Central Bank is likely to print
rubles,'' said Pyotr Neimyshev, chief trader at Chase Manhattan
Bank International.
	   Most Russian media assessed the Central Bank's move as a lesser
of two evils.
	   ``The decision made by the Central Bank is justified,'' said the
business daily Kommersant. ``Today we already have the ruble
falling and inflation, but the nation can't live without the
banking system.''
	   The non-payment crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill, including tax payments
to the federal budget. It has threatened to bring broader economic
activity to a halt if no action is taken.
	   The ruble devaluation and forced debt restructure dealt a hard
blow to Russian banks, putting many on the verge of collapse. They
have also incurred huge losses to foreign investors.
	   The government said on Thursday that a decision on debt
restructuring was being delayed until Sept. 25 to try to work out a
deal acceptable to foreign lenders.
	   Meanwhile, the composition and policies of the new Russian
cabinet remained in limbo on Friday. Adding to the confusion were
reports that a moderate lawmaker appointed deputy prime minister
had rejected the job.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov picked Vladimir Ryhkov, a deputy
speaker of the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, as his
deputy in charge of social affairs earlier this week.
	   However, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday that Ryzhkov
had rejected the job because the appointment came without
consultations with him while he was on a foreign trip.
	   Ryzhkov, a 32-year old member of the moderate, pro-government
Our Home Is Russia faction, met with Primakov early Friday.
Following the meeting, Ryzhkov locked himself up in his parliament
offices. ``No comment. I'm still thinking,'' he said over
telephone.
	   In the latest Cabinet appointment on Friday, Vadim Gustov, 50,
the governor of the St. Petersburg region was named first deputy
prime minister in charge of relations with the regions.

Malaysian ousted minister calls on Mahathir to step down
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, fighting for his freedom and his political life, made a
stunning call Friday for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to step
down.
	   Just as startling, hundreds in the crowd listening to Anwar
Ibrahim responded with shouts of support, punching their fists in
the air, and chanting, ``God is great.''
	   Calls for a prime minister's resignation are extremely rare in
Malaysia.
	   Even opposition parties have not called for Mahathir to leave
office or suggested he be investigated for corruption, as Anwar did
this week in a series of increasingly scathing speeches.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's heir-apparent, made the call as he
escalates his challenge against the man who has ruled Malaysia for
17 years.
	   ``I call for the prime minister to step down,'' Anwar said,
shouting from a platform in front of a two-story house near the
beach.
	   When he yelled to the crowd of 5,000, asking them whether they
were behind his call, hundreds replied, ``We do.''
	   About 15 police officers, who had earlier barred Anwar from
speaking in front of a mosque, stood by but did nothing.
	   After grooming Anwar as his successor, the mercurial Mahathir
fired him Sept. 2 from the posts of deputy prime minister and
finance minister, then engineered Anwar's ouster from the ruling
party. Mahathir said that Anwar was morally unfit to hold office.
	   Five of Anwar's associates have been arrested as part of a
police investigation against Anwar on allegations of sexual
misconduct, abuse of power, interfering in a police probe and
leaking state secrets.
	   Anwar, who has denied the charges, says authorities are
embarrassed to detain him during the Commonwealth Games ending
Sept. 21 and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, which ends Sept. 23.
	   He told the crowd that on Sunday, the day the queen arrives, he
would speak in Merdeka Square in the center of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
	   How much longer the authorities will tolerate Anwar's challenge
is the top question on the streets.
	   Najib Tun Razak, vice president of the ruling United Malays
National organization, said Thursday that Anwar's nationwide
campaign, calling for reform, ``could create chaos and spark a
revolution, which would eventually lead to anarchy in the
country.''
	   Mahathir has responded almost mildly in public. In comments
published in Friday's papers, he challenged Anwar to prove his
innocence and criticized Anwar's attacks on the judiciary as a ploy
to claim unfair trial later.
	   ``Produce the evidence if there is evidence. We do not have a
problem with that,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Friday's Star
newspaper.
	   Police have said they would press charges against Anwar if he
speaks without a police permit. His increasingly personal
references to Mahathir in speeches over the past three days appear
to some observers to be almost daring arrest.
	   Friday's speech was the boldest yet.
	   ``I slogged day and night for him. I didn't challenge him,''
said Anwar.
	   ``I feared opposing him,'' he said. ``But now I'm battling
him.''
	   Anwar has accused Mahathir of firing him because Anwar was the
best political alternative to Mahathir.
	   Anwar called on police to be fair in their investigation of
himself, his family and his friends. But police must do the same
with Mahathir, his sons and his family, he said.
	   ``What has he done for the downtrodden?'' Anwar said of
Mahathir, mocking the prime minister's pride in building the
world's tallest building in the capital.

North Korea says no reform, no openness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Despite its massive economic
difficulties and widespread famine, North Korea declared Friday
that it will stick to its isolationist economic policy.
	   In an article in its official organ, the ruling Workers' Party
reaffirmed that juche, or self-reliance, will continue to be the
backbone of the communist country's economic policy.
	   ``It is a foolish daydream to try to revive the economy by
introducing foreign capital, not relying on one's own strength,''
said the article in Rodong Sinmun.
	   Rodong Sinmum described the article as the policy of Kim
Jong-il, who was installed as North Korea's supreme leader earlier
this month.
	   The article, also published by Kuroja, or the Laborer, a party
publication, warned that capitalistic economic reforms would only
cause catastrophic results as shown in former Soviet-bloc
countries.
	   ``We will ... set ourselves against all the attempts to induce
us to join an `integrated' world,'' the article said. ``We have
nothing to `reform' and `open.' ''
	   The article admitted that North Korea faces serious economic
difficulties but said that under Kim Jong Il, the country will
revitalize its economy ``one sector after another as ants gnaw a
piece of bone.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five South Korean civic groups will
send 1 billion won (dlrs 719,000) worth of free food to
hunger-stricken North Korea by mid-October, government officials
said Friday.
	   For the first time, the civic groups will give the aid directly
to North Korea, said the Ministry of National Unification, a
government agency in charge of relations with North Korea.
	   In the past, all aid has been delivered through U.N. agencies or
the state-controlled Red Cross.
	   Shipments of 2,510 tons of corn, 200 milk cows and sugar and
powered milk will begin Monday, the ministry said.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war after their
three-year war ended without a peace treaty in 1953, and civilian
contact is strictly controlled by both governments.
	   South Korea has given North Korea dlrs 352 million worth of food
since the communist country turned to the international community
to feed its 22 million people in 1995.
	   North Korea has suffered through three years of disastrous
weather that aggravated food problems caused by inefficient
cooperative farming techniques.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition politician Sam Rainsy
said Friday he would cooperate with the regime of strongman Hun Sen
if it would help ``put Cambodia back on its feet,'' although he
feared the government planned to kill him.
	   ``We have to address the serious situations facing this
country,'' Sam Rainsy said at a news conference at his home. ``How
are we going to resolve the food crisis, ensure the rule of law?''
	   Sam Rainsy on Thursday spent his first night in more than a week
outside the United Nations offices in a Phnom Penh hotel where he
had taken refuge after being threatened with arrest. Strongman Hun
Sen had accused him of being behind a grenade attack on his home on
Sept. 7.
	   Hun Sen was not home and no one was hurt by the blast, which
opposition leaders accused Hun Sen of staging as a pretext to crack
down on his opponents. A violent police crackdown against largely
peaceful anti-government protesters began within hours of the
attack.
	   Sam Rainsy and his family spent 10 days sleeping on the floor of
the U.N. offices after seeking the protection of the U.N. Secretary
General's Personal Representative in Cambodia.
	   He returned home Thursday when he was told that there was little
the U.N. could do if authorities decided to carry out their threats
of arrest, he said.
	   ``I have been told that to arrest me would be very embarrassing
for the government, they would not know how to handle custody of a
leading opposition leader,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``But if they just
get rid of me by killing me, this would solve the problem very
easily.''
	   He said he thought, however, he would not be arrested as long as
his party attended the convening of the National Assembly on Sept.
24 and did not block the formation of a new government
	   Sam Rainsy had already agreed Thursday to a plan for an
all-party summit meeting under the sponsorship of the king, and for
his party to attend the Sept. 24 convening of parliament, which it
had previously threatened to boycott.
	   The summit meeting will be held next Tuesday in the northwestern
town of Siem Reap.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won July 26
parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government on its own.
	   Sam Rainsy's party and opposition ally Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party accused Hun Sen of winning through
fraud, and had threatened to not attend the National Assembly.
	   Ranariddh earlier this week agreed to attend, leaving the Sam
Rainsy Party _ with only 15 of the total 122 assembly seats _ no
political leverage.
	   Opposition supporters had demonstrated to protest the election
results, but police last week violently cracked down on the street
protests, killing at least four people and arresting and beating
dozens others.
	   ``The only option left is to continue our struggle in the
National Assembly because we want to avoid violence and prevent
confrontation,'' Sam Rainsy said Friday.
	   Sam Rainsy said the opposition will continue to press two of its
election complaints, and push for ``the respect of fundamental
rights, constitutional rights, freedom of speech and assembly,
freedom of movement.''
	   ``If these fundamental rights are not resolved, we will not talk
about any coalition government,'' he said.
	   Sam Rainsy's opposition ally Ranariddh meanwhile flew to
Bangkok, Thailand. No reason for his trip was given.
	   A travel ban had been imposed on all opposition members of
parliament and other government critics after the grenade incident.
Despite the prince's trip, the ban apparently remained in effect
for the others.

Number of corpses discovered around Cambodian capital reaches 21
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The tally of unidentified corpses
discovered in recent days in and around the capital has climbed to
21, United Nations human rights workers said Friday.
	   Government officials said it is too early to say whether the
deaths are linked to current political unrest. But the bodies began
appearing after anti-government demonstrations were violently
suppressed by police.
	   Three bodies were found Thursday just south of Phnom Penh
floating in rivers or ponds, said a U.N. human rights worker,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
	   One victim's skull was smashed in small pieces, with his hands
tied behind his back, his mouth gagged, and his abdomen cut open,
he said.
	   Another victim had been shot several times and dumped in a lake
with a bag of bricks tied to his back.
	   The last, the corpse of a woman, was in an advanced state of
decay, with no clear signs of torture.
	   Thousands of demonstrators had taken to the streets calling for
the resignation of Cambodian leader Hun Sen, whose party won
parliamentary elections in July. The opposition charged the polls
were marred by fraud.
	   Only four protesters are known to have been killed when police
broke up demonstrations, but the discovery of a large number of
corpses has raised suspicions of a cover-up.
	   The government has said that there is no evidence to prove that
the corpses are in any way linked to the political unrest.
	   ``Even before the demonstrations took place, we the authorities
have found bodies which have been shot dead, victims of robbery and
kidnapping and looting and so on,'' said Interior Ministry
spokesman Khieu Sopheak. ``So it's too early to say they are
demonstrators.''

Socialists poised for narrow hold on power in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS newspaper in 4th graf to Svenska Dagbladet sted
Dagens Nyheter, ADDS comment from pollster, details from afternoon
papers &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Heading into national elections, Swedes
are trying to decide where their famed Middle Way is leading:
toward success or to the verge of failure.
	   After a discouraging decade in which the country suffered from
high unemployment and the fabric of its tightly knit social
services network began to unravel, the governing Social Democrats
say the worst is over and that the country's mix of socialism and
capitalism is back on track.
	   The conservative opposition, led by the Moderates party of
former prime minister Carl Bildt, says the worst is yet to come
unless Sweden abandons its high-tax ways.
	   Polls ahead of Sunday's elections show voters leaning toward the
status quo, but not with much conviction. A poll by the SIFO
organization published Friday in the national newspaper Svenska
Dagbladet showed the Social Democrats attracting the most support
at 36.8 percent _ far short of enough to govern alone. The
Moderates were at 24.8 percent.
	   Throughout the campaign, the graphs of support levels for the
two major parties have remained nearly flat, while five smaller
parties likely to win some of the 349 seats in the Riksdag
parliament have soared or plunged.
	   The two parties at the far ends of the ideological spectrum are
surging. The Left Party, the former Communists, have nearly doubled
their current support to 11.8 percent, according to Friday's poll,
while the Christian Democrats are at 10.1 percent, a 150-percent
jump from their support in the last elections in 1994.
	   Two other non-socialist parties gathered a total of 9.7 percent
and the Greens, likely to support the Social Democrats in a new
government, polled 4.7 percent.
	   A government of the Social Democrats with support from the Left
and Greens would likely continue the policies that, according to
the OECD, make Sweden the world's most heavily taxed country: in
1997, the tax burden was more than 53 percent of gross domestic
product.
	   The high taxes support Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare benefits
and social services, but they are discouraging to businesses.
Several major Swedish companies, including telecommunications giant
LM Ericsson, the country's largest company, have threatened to move
their headquarters out of Sweden unless the business climate
improves.
	   The Swedish economy is reasonably healthy. Unemployment is at
7.3 percent, but has been falling for the past two years as Sweden
digs out of the economic crisis of the early 1990s, inflation is
virtually nil, and the country foresees a budget surplus this year.
	   But the Moderates say continuing the high taxes condemns Sweden
to being marginalized in an increasingly competitive global
economy. They propose a tax cut of 80 billion kronor (dlrs 10
billion) over three years. That would still keep Sweden's tax
burden extraordinarily high _ about 50 percent of GDP _ but would
stimulate job creation, Bildt contends.
	   Bildt has repeatedly lambasted the Social Democrats as holding
on to outmoded ideas and the contention has struck a chord with the
young. Pollster Toivo Sjoeren of SIFO said support for the
Moderates among first-time voters is about 40 percent.
	   But the party's relatively low support overall reflects many
Swedes' resistance to allowing the cold realities of the
marketplace more power in shaping their country.
	   ``We think that solidarity is modern, and egoism is
old-fashioned,'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson characterized the
issue in a television debate this week.
	   But Sweden's taxes and the regulations that are often obstacles
to small businessmen can also be alienating to many.
	   ``The government should pay more attention to projects like
this,'' said Miguel Montoya, proprietor of an outdoor jewelry stall
on a main Stockholm square. ``I had been unemployed ... Now I feel
myself part of things.''
	   Another sign of widespread disaffection has appeared in the
pre-voting polls, where around 12 percent of the respondents have
said they are undecided _ about twice the level from previous
elections. ``They are tired, they feel frustrated,'' said analyst
Hans Alfredson of the TEMO polling organization.
	   A generally unexciting election campaign hasn't helped. Persson
and Bildt inspire little personal affection among voters. Persson
is regarded by many as being didactic and condescending, while
Bildt puts many off with his cerebral aura and sharp tongue.
	   There has been no issue that has caught fire. Bildt tried
unsuccessfully to make Sweden's hesitance to join the European
Union's single-currency program a linchpin of his contention that
Sweden has ``Europe's most pusillanimous government.''
	   But most parties from left to right either oppose the EMU or say
joining it should be put to a referendum, which surveys indicate
would fail.
	   A brief potential controversy emerged this week when Gudrun
Schyman, head of the high-tax Left Party, admitted she had failed
to report to the tax authorities some payments she made to a girl
who helped clean her house, but the issue lost steam quickly.
	   The election's failure to capture strong interest could be
gauged from the headlines in Stockholm's two afternoon newspapers
on Friday. For one, the election was the day's top story, while the
other led with an investigation of which liquor store has the
fastest service.

Two Khmer Rouge `intellectuals' defect to the Cambodian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two officials from the
all-but-defunct Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement have defected to the
government, state television announced Friday, but the fate of one
of its top leaders remains unclear.
	   The two men, Tep Khunnal and Khan Soeun, had been among the last
so-called ``intellectuals'' with the rebel group after its near
total collapse earlier this year, when large numbers of guerrillas
defected and government troops pushed the rest out from their last
major stronghold.
	   Cambodia's leader, Hun Sen, was quoted as saying he welcomed the
news of the defections.
	   The rebel group's longtime leader, Pol Pot, was arrested by his
comrades last year in an internal power struggle and died in April
this year as his movement was collapsing.
	   Many middle-level officials and ``intellectuals'' defected this
year.
	   The rebel band is now led by veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok
and the group's main ideologue, Nuon Chea.
	   What remains a mystery is the fate of Khieu Samphan, another
veteran revolutionary who has served as the group's titular
president in the past. It appears that Khieu Samphan may remain
with Ta Mok's group, although perhaps not voluntarily.
	   Tep Khunnal had been an aide to Khieu Samphan, but his statement
read on television had no reference to him.
	   ``Seeing a need to put an end to the war, we decided to cut away
from Ta Mok and Nuon Chea,'' said the statement attributed to Tep
Khunnal and Khan Soeun. ``We recognize his Majesty King Norodom
Sihanouk as a symbol of national reconciliation and recognize the
constitution.''
	   The statement was dated Sept. 11 and said to be written at Phnom
Malai, a former guerrilla base on the Thai border when many
defectors have settled.
	   In early July, Tep Khunnal had said in a jungle interview that a
faction of the rebel movement led by Khieu Samphan had been holding
talks with the government after splitting with Ta Mok and Nuon
Chea.
	   He had also claimed then that Ta Mok and Nuon Chea had ``decided
to leave our organization.''
	   A Thai military source familiar with Khmer Rouge activities also
said at that time that Khieu Samphan had split with Ta Mok and Nuon
Chea, whom he said were protected by only about 100 guerrillas.
	   The government in Phnom Penh maintains it wants to try Ta Mok,
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan for crimes against humanity during the
Khmer Rouge regime, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.
	   In June it had hinted of contacts with Khieu Samphan, when Hun
Sen said, ``We will forgive'' him if he helped capture Ta Mok and
Nuon Chea.
	   But Hun Sen later indicated Khieu Samphan, who never had armed
clout in the movement, would be unlikely to cooperate and it would
be better to capture him.
	   A score of other high-ranking Khmer Rouge have since defected
and been allowed to live in peace for what Hun Sen has identified
as national reconciliation, raising the prospect that none of the
Khmer Rouge would ever be tried for their genocidal activities.

Premier Leauge considering pro referees and video replays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Professional referees and video replays to
adjudicate on contentious goals are among inititiatives proposed
for England's Premier League soccer competition next season.
	   Premier League referees' officer Philip Don on Friday said the
introduction of professional referees would help match officials
meet the expanding demands of players and fans.
	   Don said video replays would only be used in close goal
decisions, to verify whether or not the ball crosses the goal line.
	   ``The likes of fouls and infringements are down to the referee's
opinion,'' he said.
	   Rugby League and cricket already use video replays to support
officials in domestic competitions, while the technology is also
being used in other European soccer leagues.
	   Don said sponsorship would subsidize the wages for referees,
reportedly up to 50,000 pounds (dlrs 84,000) for top officials.
	   Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said the proposals could be
introduced by next season.
	   ``The thinking behind it all is to make sure there is continuous
improvement in refereeing standards,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion cyclist Lucy
Tyler-Sharman was expelled from the Australian Commonwealth Games
team Friday for criticizing team management.
	   In the latest soap opera style scandal to affect the Australian
cycling team, Tyler-Sharman broke an agreement not to criticize
other members of the group.
	   She had been due to race for a bronze in the 3,000-meter pursuit
race Friday but was banned from competing, and she will also miss
Sunday's points race. England's Yvonne McGregor won the bronze in a
walkover.
	   Tyler-Sharman, who won the world title in that event at
Bordeaux, France, last month, lost her Commonwealth Games semifinal
Thursday night.
	   She attacked team management, including coach Charlie Walsh, in
a post-race interview and was dragged away from the cameras by
cycling team manager Michael Flynn.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' said Don Stockins, head of the Australian delegation.
	   As a result, he said, he had decided to expel her from the team,
and ``we both agreed that she should leave the (athletes') village
as soon as possible. She will do this today.''
	   Tyler-Sharman, a former United States rider who moved to
Australia in 1991, fell out with Walsh earlier this year and she
complained in a letter to the Australian Sports Commission in July
about his conduct.
	   ``Nothing has gone to plan since I came here,'' Tyler-Sharman
said after Thursday's race. ``First of all they insisted _ insisted
_ I have a head coach ordering me during the ride who wasn't my
head coach. They informed me of that last night and wouldn't let me
out of it.''
	   Tyler-Sharman also implied her pedals had been sabotaged, a
claim hotly denied by team support staff.
	   ``When I went for my first ride this morning they insisted I
changed my pedals,'' she said. ``Then, bolted in as I was on the
line, they (the pedals) both failed.
	   ``I pulled out of one pedal on the line ... and someone yelled
put your foot back in, so I went, and then I pulled out another
foot in the course of the ride.''
	   Flynn then stepped in and took Tyler-Sharman into a room outside
the track, where they were seen to argue heatedly for several
minutes.
	   All members of Australia's Commonwealth Games team have signed
agreements not to comment on other members.
	   ``Lucy acknowledged that there was a flare-up at the time,''
Stockins said, referring to Tyler-Sharman's outburst. ``She
realized she had made a mistake.''
	   Stockins warned athletes that he would not tolerate such
behavior.
	   ``The athletes need to recognize the agreement, they need to be
aware there are leaders, bosses and decision-makers. ... Their
decisions need to be observed,'' Stockins said.
	   Tyler-Sharman, 33, is a six-time American champion and 14-time
Australian champion.
	   She joined Walsh's national squad in late 1995 and he led her
away from the sprint events towards the 3,000-meter pursuit.
	   Walsh backed her to ride the pursuit at the Atlanta Olympics
against Kathy Watt after she won a time trial against her rival.
Watt, who was originally named in the Olympic team for the event,
took the selectors to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and won,
earning reinstatement.
	   Tyler-Sharman won bronze in the points race at Atlanta and a few
weeks later vindicated her switch to the pursuit by briefly holding
the world record and then taking silver in that race at the world
championships.
	   Illness thwarted her efforts at the worlds last year in her home
town of Perth where she was fourth.
	   There was no sign of trouble with Walsh when she again won the
pursuit at the track nationals earlier this year but reports
started filtering out of the team's camp in Buttgen, Germany of
tensions. These tensions had escalated by the time the riders
reached a high-altitude camp in Colorado Springs in the US.
	   Tyler-Sharman and husband Graham Sharman, whom she married in
1995, split from the team after intervention from Australian Sports
Commission officials.
	   In a letter to the ASC, Tyler-Sharman alleged Walsh was now
vindictive in his conduct.
	   Tyler-Sharman's world title in Bordeaux was her first in 15
years of trying.

Rights groups vows to defy government and support gays in Zambia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A human rights group said it will
recognize Zambia's first gay rights organization despite threats by
the government to arrest gays and their sympathizers.
	   The Zambia Independent Monitoring Team said it will next week
register the Lesbians, Gays and Transgender Persons Association as
an affiliate body.
	   Alfred Zulu, head of the human rights group, said if the
government took punitive action his group would be forced to name
government officials with links to gays.
	   ``We don't want to disclose names but if pushed too far, we'll
do so,'' Zulu told a meeting of human rights and civic groups on
minority rights in Lusaka on Thursday.
	   Earlier this month Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa and
Legal affairs Minister Vincent Malambo promised to arrest gays and
supporters of their group.
	   Sodomy is an offense in Zambia but it is not illegal to declare
ones' sexual preferences, Zulu said.
	   The gay rights group has about 100 registered members.
	   At the meeting, Jon Lomoy, the Norwegian ambassador to Zambia,
commended the courage of those who openly debated homosexuality in
African countries traditionally hostile to same-sex partners.
	   President Frederick Chiluba, like President Robert Mugabe of
neighboring Zimbabwe, maintains homosexuality is foreign to African
culture and was brought to the continent from the West.
	   Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against gays in his
country, but the controversial debate has only emerged in Zambia in
recent weeks.

Dutch airbase to be venue of proposed Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch and British governments have
chosen a Dutch airbase as the site for the proposed trial of the
two Libyan suspects of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
	   British Ambassador to the Netherlands Rosemary Spencer and Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen Friday signed an agreement to
use Camp Zeist at the Soesterberg air base, about 35 kilometers (20
miles) southeast of Amsterdam, near the city of Utrecht.
	   Soesterberg was a former U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya has accepted the proposal from the United States and
Britain to try the suspects in the Netherlands by Scottish judges
under Scottish law, but is arguing specifics about the treatment of
the two suspects.
	   Both Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan
demands for guarantees before the suspects are turned over.
	   The bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

Grace Park wins individual title in intercollegiate golf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANAKURA, Japan (AP) _ Grace Park, winner of the U.S. Women's
Amateur Championship, edged Shiho Oyama in a playoff Friday and
captured the women's individual title of the 16th annual Topy Cup,
a U.S.-Japan intercollegiate golf championship.
	   Park, a South Korean sophomore from Arizona State University,
shot a 3-under-par 69 and forced the playoff at a 2-under 142
total. Oyama, a junior from Nihon University, had her second
straight 71.
	   On the first playoff hole at No. 9, the 19-year-old Park reached
the green in three shots and two-putted for par, while Oyama missed
a 3-foot (1-meter) par putt.
	   Park's final-round 69, the day's best, helped Arizona State
surge past overnight leader Senshu University and win the women's
team event by three strokes over Nihon University. Senshu fell to
third place.
	   Among five Arizona State's team members, Tui Selvaratham shot a
75 for 153, Michaela Friberg a 79 for 154 and Jody Niemann an 80
for 156. The team carded a two-round total of 14-over 603.
	   Nihon totaled 606, followed by Senshu's 608, University of
Arizona's 616, Kinki University's 636 and Nippon Sport Science
University's 676.
	   In the team events, each team had five players with the best
four scores counted.
	   In the men's competition, also held at the par-72 Tanakura
Country Club course, Arizona State's Greg Padilla shot a 68 for a
1-under 143 total and won the individual title by one stroke over
UCLA's Byron Schlagenhau and Tohoku Fukushi University's Hidemasa
Hoshino.
	   Overnight leader Jeff Quinney of Arizona State, winner of the
Oregon Amateur Golf Tournament and also the Pacific Northwest Golf
Association Men's Amateur Championship in July, struggled to a 78
for a share of sixth at 147.
	   Tohoku Fukushi won the team event with a two-round total of
11-over 587, followed by Arizona State's 593, Arizona University's
594 and Nihon's 600.
	   UCLA placed fifth at 603 and UNLV was seventh at 611.
	   The three-round event was shortened to 36 holes because of
Typhoon Stella and floods that hit central and northern Japan
Wednesday.
	   In 16 championships, U.S. men's and women's teams have won nine
trophies each.

Philippine stocks drop sharply on profit-taking; index down 7.5
</HEADLINE>
percent &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower; analyst comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply Friday
on profit-taking sparked by a steep fall in Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co.'s stock.
	   After takeover rumors ignited a record 25 percent jump in PLDT's
share price Thursday, the stock plunged 17 percent Friday to 840
pesos (dlrs 19.18).
	   The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index slumped 94.63
points, or 7.5 percent, to 1,174.61, erasing its 92.70-point gain
Thursday.
	   Friday's drop ended a four-day rally in which the index rose
187.06 points for the market's most significant advance in three
months.
	   The broader All Shares Index was off 19.98 points to 393.09
after climbing 19.96 points Thursday.
	   Analysts said Philippine Airlines' decision to close its
operations next week also damped investor sentiment, particularly
toward banks, a number of which have exposure to the airline.
	   Philippine National Bank, the airlines' largest local creditor,
fell 5.3 percent.
	   Overall, losers beat gainers 59 to 18, with 27 issues unchanged.
	   ``Profit-taking was bound to happen. Yesterday's advance was
clearly a fluke, with only one issue bringing up the market,'' said
Julie Villena, analyst for Magnum International Securities Inc.
	   She said PLDT will continue to hold sway in the market in coming
days, given persistent rumors about a possible takeover of the
country's most profitable telephone company.
	   Analysts said an upcoming decision on U.S. interest rates would
also have a strong influence on the market next week.
	   In currency trading, the peso was pressured by the steep stock
losses and by PAL's announcement it will shut down, dealers said.
	   The peso's weakness was in marked contrast to the generally
steady performance of regional currencies.
	   The dollar averaged 43.891 pesos for the day, up from 43.780
pesos on Thursday. The dollar tested the sensitive level of 44
pesos and closed at 43.910 pesos.
	   Dealers said the gray market saw the dollar changing hands as
high as 44.10 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the peso was pressured by
fears that the closure of PAL would mean that banks with credit
exposure to the stricken airline would have to cover their
dollar-denominated loans.
	   PAL is mired in debts of dlrs 2.1 billion to financial
institutions and aircraft lessors. It has secured a suspension of
debt payments pending the approval of a rehabilitation plan by
regulators and creditors.
	   But there is much uncertainty over how the debts would be
handled, and there still appears to be a chance that the airline
can be saved.

Deutsche Telekom negotiating to sell loss-making cable division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Telekom is negotiating with
several possible buyers for its loss-making cable division _ banks,
cable network operators, media companies and a large computer
software company.
	   Market observers have long speculated that Microsoft is the
software company, given Telekom's existing cooperation with the
Seattle-based giant on Internet technology.
	   Telekom board member Gerd Tenzer confirmed the negotiations
Thursday but refused to identify the interested parties.
	   Telekom's board announced Wednesday that it had approved
management's decision in May to unbundle its broad-band cable
business on Jan. 1 by founding an unspecified number of
subsidiaries. It plans to sell stakes in the subsidiaries.
	   A single investor could acquire a majority-holding on a regional
basis, but not in all regions, Tenzer said.
	   Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom, which offers telephone and on-line
services, is 74 percent government owned. It has faced competition
since the Jan. 1 liberalization of the German telecommunications
market according to European Union regulations.

Germany granting European Central Bank directors diplomatic status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany is granting diplomatic status
to the six executive directors of the new European Central Bank
under an agreement signed Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and bank president Wim Duisenberg
signed the document at a ceremony in Frankfurt, where the bank that
will oversee Europe's new single currency - the euro - is based.
	   Among other things, the agreement stipulates that the European
bank is independent of German financial regulators and its
employees do not need German work or residency permits.
	   The agreement must be ratified by the German parliament.
Officials said they hoped it could be passed before the
introduction of the single currency on Jan. 1.

Most Asian markets dragged down by global woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower
Friday on the back of an overnight plunge on Wall Street. Bucking
the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the key index
rebounded after falling to a 12-year low a day earlier.
	   Philippine shares tumbled nearly 8 percent on profit-taking
sparked by a steep fall in the stock of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co.
	   After takeover rumors ignited a 25 percent jump in PLDT's share
price Thursday, the stock plunged 17 percent on a technical
correction.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks
slumped 94.63 points, or 7.5 percent, to 1,174.61.
	   In Indonesia, the key index closed at a six-year low amid
lingering fears that the Indonesian government may impose capital
controls.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 13.804 points,
or 4.8 percent, to close at 271.671.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
123.98 points, or 0.89 percent, closing the day's trading at
13,983.12. The rise followed a 2.38 percent decline on Thursday,
when the Nikkei closed at 13,859.14, down 338.56 points.
	   Traders said investors were hopeful Japan's ruling and
opposition parties would reach a compromise on banking reform in
time for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States
next week.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 132.10, down 2.20 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 132.18 late
in New York overnight.
	   Singapore closed sharply lower, dragged down by the overnight
plunge on Wall Street. The benchmark Straits Times Index slid 3
percent, or 28.68 points, to 912.74.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong slumped for the second straight
session.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 130.61 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at
7,445.96. On Thursday, the index had tumbled 284.11 points.
	   Brokers attributed the slump largely to the tumble on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 216.01, points,
or 2.7 percent, to close at 7873.77.
	   ``The market was bullish'' earlier this week amid hopes of a
U.S. interest rate cut, said Philip Niem, an analyst with HSBC
Securities. But these hopes have been dashed by U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent comments.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by losses
overnight on Wall Street. The market's key Weighted Stock Price
Index fell 38.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,961.76.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed as the plunge on
Wall Street fueled a slide on the local market. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index fell 27.69 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,734.67.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly lower. The All
Ordinaries Index fell 2.9 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,539.9.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on a selling spree by local
institutional investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
8.67 points, or 2.8 percent, to 302.21.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed higher, with short-term retail
investors continuing to play the market, dealers said. The
benchmark Composite Index rose 6.75 points, or 1.7 percent, to
393.30.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index rose 1.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 221.85.

Battered but unbowed, Cape Town tourism survives bomb blast

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Three days after arriving in
South Africa, British tourist Sara Green was in Johannesburg when
she heard a terrorist bomb had ripped through a crowded Cape Town
restaurant, killing two and injuring 26.
	   But despite television pictures showing bloodied victims carried
into ambulances, Green, a 30-year old teacher from London, pressed
on with plans to spend several weeks in the city.
	   ``At first I thought `Oh my God! Cape Town of all places,'''
Green said Friday. ``But I never really thought for a minute that I
wouldn't come.''
	   Nearly a month after the Planet Hollywood bomb, for which no one
has been arrested, Green and thousands of other tourists have
defied predictions that the blast would cripple Cape Town's vibrant
tourist industry.
	   With the sector projected to bring in about 11 billion rand
(dlrs 1.79 billion) this year to Cape Town's Western Cape region,
tourist officials cannot afford to ignore the bomb.
	   Though they admit they were unprepared for the attack, industry
bosses have reacted quickly to repair the city's battered image.
	   Launching a public relations offensive, Cape Metropolitan
Tourism quickly commissioned a survey showing Cape Town is the
cheapest tourist destination when compared to other popular cities
such as San Francisco and Paris.
	   Another survey, aimed at proving value for money for conference
events, is in the works and journalists are being flown in from
around the world to write holiday reviews of the city.
	   ``It is a strategy that we sat down and worked out,'' said Rick
Taylor, the tourism group's chief executive. ``We still have to go
out there and portray the positives.''
	   The plan seems to be working. The popular Waterfront shopping
area is still thronged with tourists, with only the closed-off
Planet Hollywood building serving as a reminder of the blast.
	   In the aftermath of the Aug. 25 bomb, tourism industry
consultant Gillian Saunders estimated about 350 million rand (dlrs
57 million) of revenue would be lost.
	   Most of this would come from American tourists, scared off by a
perception that Muslim extremists may have carried out the blast in
reprisal for U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   However, Saunders says the effect on the U.S. industry has been
smaller than thought and she may revise her figures downwards.
	   ``There's been a few cancellations, but nothing major,'' she
said.
	   Some tourist workers say the blast may have a longer term effect
as tourists no longer see Cape Town as a safe haven in a country
with one of the highest violent crime rates in the world.
	   Tour guide Wolfgang Steincke said that though few tourists had
canceled their holidays, the more violent image of the city could
put people off in the future.
	   The bombing ``creates an overall gloomy perception,'' he said.
``Very few places are totally safe these days.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian rider Brad McGee broke
his own Commonwealth Games record Friday, winning the men's
4,000-meter individual cycling pursuit in 4 minutes, 30.594
seconds.
	   McGee had set the record of 4:31.371 in the 1994 games in
Victoria, Canada.
	   Compatriot Luke Roberts ended with the silver after losing the
first-place race to McGee. England's Matt Illingworth won the
bronze by outracing compatriot Brad Wiggins.
	   Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand beat games record holder Alayna Burns
of Australia by 1.3 seconds for the gold in the 3,000-meter women's
individual pursuit.
	   Ulmer finished in 3:41.667 in the afternoon heat and humidity,
slower than the record of 3:40.389 that Burns had set Thursday.
	   England's Yvonne McGregor won the bronze unopposed after her
opponent in the third-place duel, world champion Lucy
Tyler-Sharman, was expelled from the Australian team earlier Friday
for criticizing team management.
	   Tyler-Sharman broke a team agreement not to criticize other
members of the group.
	   The 33-year-old Australian, who won the world title in that
event at Bordeaux, France, last month, lost her chance for gold
here when she lost a semifinal Thursday night.
	   After that race, she attacked team management, including coach
Charlie Walsh, in an interview and was dragged away from the
cameras by cycling team manager Michael Flynn.
	   Tyler-Sharman also implied her pedals had been sabotaged, a
claim hotly denied by team support staff.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' said Don Stockins, head of the Australian delegation.

Young Swiss face veteran Spaniards in Fed Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Led by World No. 1 Martina Hingis,
Switzerland will attempt to cap its three year climb out of the
tennis minor leagues with a victory over veteran Spain at the Fed
Cup finals this weekend.
	   Languishing in third division of Fed Cup play just three years
ago, Switzerland is now on the brink of claiming its first title.
	   The showdown marks the first time in Fed Cup history that a team
just coming into the world group goes directly to play for the
title.
	   The battle promises to be fierce.
	   ``My first impression is positive,'' said Swiss team captain
Melanie Molitor, Hingis' mother. ``Martina and Patty seem
comfortable on this court.
	   ``But against Spain it's 50-50,'' acknowledged Molitor. ``The
four in the final are all ranked in the top-10. And today the
difference between them is minimal.''
	   Spain, which has reached the finals seven times in the last
eight years, will be led by four-time Fed Cup champions world No. 4
Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario and No. 7 Conchita Martinez.
	   Figuring in all four Spanish Fed Cup titles in 1991, 1993, 1994
and 1995, the gritty veterans will weild the more powerful
psychological artillery.
	   The pair displayed plenty of their famous grit in their
semifinal tie against the United States in July when the two
Spaniards battled into the night to win the doubles against Lisa
Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez before finally prevailing 6-4 6-7
11-9.
	   Switzerland, on the other hand, will benefit from the choice of
surfaces _ choosing the fast Greenset indoor carpet _ and the
support of a 12,000-strong soldout crowd.
	   With her number of tournament wins dropping from 12 in 1997 to
four this season, and the loss of her U.S. Open and Wimbledon
titles, Hingis is anxious to close out a mostly disappointing
campaign on an upbeat note - starting with a Fed Cup crown.
	   The winner of four Grand Slams, Hingis' lead atop the WTA
rankings _ once in the thousands _ has slipped. The Swiss Miss is
now watching anxiously as U.S. Open champion Lindsay Davenport
inches dangerously closer to the No. 1 spot.
	   Hingis, who hasn't won a tournament since May, may not have had
the brightest season, but her record against the Spaniards is
sparkling.
	   The 17-year-old has won her last 11 matches against
Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez over the past two years, with a 7-1
record against Sanchez.
	   Hingis will be backed by world No. 9 Patty Schnyder, who has
outshone her so far this season.
	   With five titles to her credit this season _ Hobart, Hannover,
Madrid, Maria Lankowitz and Palermo _ and a record of 52 wins and
14 defeats this year, Schnyder's more than ready to face the
Spaniards.
	   Though it marks the team's first time in the world group since
1994, Hingis and Schyder marched through to the finals
unencumbered.
	   In steamroller fashion, Switzerland flattened the Czech Republic
4-1 in Brno for their place in the semifinals against France, then
swept aside the defending champions 5-0.
	   In contrast, Spain's journey was much more labored, recording a
tight 3-2 win against Germany before struggling against the
Americans.
	   ``Just getting to the final is a big success for us,'' said
Hingis, who flew by Concorde to Zurich from New York Monday after
winning the U.S. Open doubles final with Jana Novotna. ``It doesn't
happen everyday.''
	   But Hingis will unlikely be satisfied with just getting to the
finals.
	   A landmark title would satisfy the teenager's sense of duty, and
allow Hingis to tiptoe out of Fed Cup competition next year.
	   Many players find the three weeks of Fed Cup play difficult to
squeeze into an already long, packed season, and Hingis has hinted
it might not fit into her schedule next year
	   ``It'll all depend on the weekend's outcome,'' allowed Hingis.
	   Final action begins Saturday with a pair of singles matches,
while Sunday will decide the outcome of the final, with reverse
singles and a doubles match.

New government offensive causes fresh refugees exodus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A new Serb government offensive in northern Kosovo
has emptied at least 13 villages and sent more than 10,000 ethnic
Albanians fleeing, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo is worsening by the day,''
said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   About 300,000 people have been displaced and scores of villages
destroyed by the Serb attacks against Albanian rebels. Many of the
displaced are struggling to survive in the open as the harsh Balkan
winter approaches.
	   Some have spilled over the border into neighboring countries.
About 9,000 ethnic Albanians have fled to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
placing additional strains on authorities still trying to cope with
the aftermath of the Bosnian war. About 500 ethnic Albanians
blocked UNHCR's offices in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on
Thursday, appealing for shelter and food, said Janowski.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, Janowski said. Many were
reportedly sick or wounded.
	   The latest government offensive, which began earlier this week,
is concentrated on a previously peaceful region with 13 villages
some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital, Pristina. At
the last census in 1991 about 10,000 people lived in the area.
	   Janowski said Serb soldiers and police prevented UNHCR from
entering the area, although U.N. staff could see smoke coming from
one of the villages, Bajgora.
	   On the road, UNHCR staff met a family of 13, including nine
women and children, crammed into the wagon of their tractor. They
had escaped from Bajgora and had slept in open fields in drenching
rain for the previous two nights. An old woman in the wagon was
crying.
	   All the villagers told the same story, said Janowski. They
received word they would be attacked and so fled. Shortly after the
shelling started.
	   The United Nations is sending daily convoys to the displaced but
has warned this will not be enough to prevent a tragedy this
winter.

Deepening bank scandal engulfs Zimbabwe affirmative action campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The central bank refused Friday to
release a report alleging that fraud and corruption caused the
collapse of a private bank owned by Zimbabwe's leading affirmative
action campaigner.
	   The Reserve Bank gave the report to justice ministry and police
officials, said bank spokesman Remi Kahari. ``We are not in a
position to release anything,'' he said.
	   The report details the business activities of Roger Boka,
founder of Zimbabwe's first wholly black-owned private bank, United
Merchantg Bank.
	   Boka fled to the United States soon after the bank's collapse in
April in the nation's biggest banking scandal, which brought weeks
of chaos to local money markets.
	   Boka allegedly transferred more than dlrs 21 million in clients'
funds into personal accounts he held abroad in a series of illegal
transactions, the independent Financial Gazette newspaper reported
Thursday. The paper said it had been leaked a copy of the report.
	   The newspaper said Reserve Bank Governor Leonard Tsumba alleged
``rampant violations'' of hard currency regulations by Boka.
	   The government itself was owed more than 1 billion Zimbabwe
dollars (dlrs 35 million) by the collapsed bank after the state had
to honor fake investment bills sold by Boka on behalf of
government-owned enterprises.
	   ``UMB was grossly mismanaged and was operated in total disregard
of laws, rules and regulations,'' Tsumba said in the central bank
report.
	   Loans, some to politicians, were granted imprudently and
corruptly, draining funds from the bank's dwindling reserves and
causing its own checks to bounce, the report said.
	   The disclosures were expected to deeply embarrass the government
and ruling party leaders who supported an outspoken campaign by
Boka for black advancement in the economy of the former British
colony.
	   Boka, in his 50s and in poor health, headed a group of companies
that were at the forefront of a campaign for black advancement in
the economy since Zimbabwe embraced Western-style economic reforms
in 1990 after a decade of strict socialist policies.
	   The bank was the first of several ``indigenous'' finance houses
hailed as breaking the traditional domination of the financial
sector by mostly white-managed foreign banks.
	   The bank purported to offer loans to blacks at favorable terms
and accused multinational banks of discriminating against black
entrepreneurs who lacked collateral.
	   Tsumba suggested Boka was granted a banking license for
political reasons, according to The Financial Gazette.
	   ``It is clear that licensing standards were bent to accommodate
an otherwise undeserving applicant,'' Tsumba said.
	   There was no immediate indication of the losses of ordinary
depositors. Tsumba said Boka and his aides concealed or destroyed
much of the banks records.
	   Attorney General Patrick Chinamasa said Zimbabwe will seek
Boka's extradition from the United States once police have prepared
charges against him.
	   Boka is reportedly living in a family-owned mansion near
Atlanta.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ International attempts to cool passions
in Albania appeared to be working Friday, with only a few thousand
people heeding a call by the former president to join in massive
protest against the government headed by his rival.
	   Between 3,000-4,000 people rallied in central Skanderbeg Square
to hear ex-President Sali Berisha rail against the ``dictatorship'
of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano and call for his
resignation. There were no immediate reports of similar
demonstrations elsewhere.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that the tensions kindling violent riots early this week may be
fading.
	   Ahead of the protest, international officials urged Albanians to
remain reasonable.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. President Rexhep Meidani also issued a
public appeal for calm after meeting with Everts and other Western
officials.
	   Parliament was expected to discuss legal moves against Berisha
on Friday, including having him arrested on charges of staging an
attempted coup. But on the urging of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe and European Union officials, it was
expected to defer a decision until next week, in hopes that would
allow tempers to cool further.
	   While also appealing for calm, Berisha on Thursday accused Nano,
his longtime political foe, of seeking confrontation and of wanting
``to direct the country toward civil conflict.''
	   Berisha earlier urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries of the Cold War era. But most Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   Corruption is also rife under Nano's elected government. Still,
he is backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the unrest from
fueling other crises in the region, mainly the violence in
neighboring Kosovo province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   While the parliamentary commission moved to lift the immunity
from arrest Berisha enjoys as a member of the legislature, it
decided against removing the immunity of five of his Democratic
Party allies, pending further evidence.
	   The crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha. Nobody has claimed
responsibility for the killing, but Berisha immediately blamed
Nano.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year. In seeking a return to
power, Berisha has exploited outrage over Hajdari's killing and
widespread disappointment with the government's inability to revive
the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.

Belgian trainer of Tour de France team arrested in drug scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ In the latest fallout from the
scandal-plagued Tour de France, police on Friday arrested the
trainer of cycling team La Francaise des Jeux on charges of
supplying performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Jeff D'Hont, a Belgian, was placed under formal investigation _
one step short of being charged _ for ``supplying and encouraging
the use of doping substances,'' officials said.
	   D'Hont, who in the past has worked for the Festina team, was
questioned earlier Friday by investigating judge Patrick Keil after
cyclists told police he was linked to the supply of drugs.
	   The investigation into drug abuse at this year's Tour de France
has centered mainly around the Festina team, which was expelled
from the race, and TVM, which pulled out along with five other
teams in protest.
	   Although police raided the La Francaise des Jeux team hotel
during a general swoop on suspected teams during the latter stages
of the race, no proof of drug-taking was found.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the Tour de France. The
pack was reduced to fewer than 100 riders from the original 189.

Prime minister gives into to opposition demands on bank reform

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to break an embarrassing deadlock ahead of
his visit to the United States next week, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Friday bowed to opposition demands on a crucial set of
bills to clean up Japan's debt-laden banks.
	   Naoto Kan, head of the largest opposition party, said Obuchi
agreed to nationalize one of Japan's largest banks, the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and curtail the powers of the
Ministry of Finance, which is widely blamed for getting the banking
industry into its mess.
	   ``They accepted our offer,'' the Democratic Party leader said
after meeting with Obuchi and other ruling party officials.
	   Obuchi continued to hold talks with the heads of other
opposition parties and had no immediate comment.
	   The breakthrough followed marathon negotiations that continued
through the night and called off at 5 a.m. Friday (2000 GMT
Thursday) after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement. They
resumed negotiations later.
	   The bills are aimed at cleaning up some 76 trillion yen (dlrs
575 billion) in bad loans that have burdened the nation's banks
since the collapse of the property market in the early 1990s.
	   Under intense pressure from abroad and from Japanese voters,
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to get the
bills passed to fix the bad loan problem.
	   But the opposition, which controls enough seats in the upper
house of Japan's bicameral legislature to block the bills, has
demanded several significant changes.
	   One of the biggest points of contention was curtailing the
powers of Japan's mighty Finance Ministry. Opposition lawmakers
said the prime minister agreed to their demands to transfer
oversight of financial markets from the ministry to a new committee
by next June.
	   Another was to let bad banks fail and limit the use of taxpayer
money to protect depositors and healthy borrowers.
	   Obuchi originally sought to draw from a 13 trillion-yen (dlrs
100 billion) pool of public funds that had been set aside to prop
up banks to avoid shocks to the financial system. The opposition
wants the pool eliminated.
	   The debate came to a head over a ruling party proposal to spend
part of the money to bail out cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   Under Friday's agreement, the prime minister gave into
opposition demands that public money be used to clean up the bank's
bad loans only after placing it under government control _
effectively proclaiming it bankrupt.
	   The opposition parties have also sought greater disclosure of
the failed bank's financial records, the resignation of executives
and writing off as many bad loans as possible using stockholders'
capital before introducing taxpayer money.
	   Obuchi wanted an agreement Friday before he meets President
Clinton Tuesday in New York.
	   Top U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, who visited Tokyo this week, have criticized Japan for
dragging its feet and not doing more to revive its economy and ease
the economic crisis in Asia.
	   The impasse over the bills has roiled world financial markets by
stirring fears that Japan will not be able to pull itself out of
its longest recession in half a century.

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank moved Friday to help the troubled
banking system by infusing more money into the economy, an action
that immediately triggered a further plunge of the ruble.
	   Russia's new government wants to make sure the country's shaky
banks don't fail, and it also wants to pay overdue wages to state
workers.
	   But economists have warned about the dangers of hyperinflation
if the government pumps too much money into the economy to meet
these goals. Prices soared 43 percent in the just the first two
weeks of September.
	   The Central Bank invited leading Russian banks to submit lists
of all outstanding debts and said it would lower reserve
requirements for banks in relatively sound financial position.
	   That means the banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on
hand, and could settle debts, improving the overall liquidity in
the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those treasuries had been frozen by the Central Bank in a
controversial debt restructuring plan announced last month.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some of the treasury bills.
Kozlov wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed
it would be strictly limited.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble was down again and was nearing its all-time
low of 20 to the dollar, reached earlier this month.
	   At the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, U.S. dollars for
next-day delivery opened at 18-20 rubles in over-the-counter
trading, compared to 15 on Thursday.
	   ``I think it's because the Central Bank is likely to print
rubles,'' said Pyotr Neimyshev, chief trader at Chase Manhattan
Bank International.
	   The Russian generally supported the Central Bank's move as a way
to protect the banks.
	   ``The decision made by the Central Bank is justified,'' said the
business daily Kommersant. ``Today we already have the ruble
falling and inflation, but the nation can't live without the
banking system.''
	   The economic crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill. It also threatens to
bring broader economic activity to a halt.
	   In a move to help importers and exporters, the Central Bank on
Friday revoked its earlier order requiring them to secure
pre-payments for their transactions.
	   The move was taken ``in order to avoid shortage of staples and
medicines,'' the Central Bank said in a statement released to the
media. Many Russians stocked up on medicines when the crisis hit,
leaving pharmacy shelves bare.
	   Meanwhile, the composition and policies of the new Russian
cabinet remained in limbo Friday. Adding to the confusion were
reports that a moderate lawmaker appointed deputy prime minister
had rejected the job.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov picked Vladimir Ryhkov, a deputy
speaker of the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, as his
deputy in charge of social affairs earlier this week.
	   However, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Friday that Ryzhkov
had rejected the job because he was appointed without being
consulted.
	   Ryzhkov, a 32-year old member of the moderate, pro-government
Our Home Is Russia faction, met with Primakov early Friday.
Following the meeting, Ryzhkov locked himself up in his parliament
offices. ``No comment. I'm still thinking,'' he said over the
telephone.
	   In another Cabinet appointment, Vadim Gustov, 50, the governor
of the St. Petersburg region was named first deputy prime minister
in charge of relations with Russia's regions.

Japan donates dlrs 162,180 to Laos for vocational schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan has donated dlrs 162,180 to help
Laos build vocational schools in two provinces, Laos government
radio said Friday.
	   The schools provide vocational training for residents of
Oudomsay and Sayaboury provinces, government radio said.
	   The United Nations Development Program and Laotian officials
spent five months working with the local residents to assess the
needs for the training facilities, it said.
	   The agreement was signed Thursday by Japan's Ambassador to
Thailand Hiroomi Sakai and Khamsing Solasouk, vice director for
planning in Sayaboury, and Somkeo Manivanh, head of the rural
development office Oudomsay.

Austrian interior minister says more money needed for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union should consider
establishing a joint task force to manage a probable flood of
refugees from Kosovo if predictions of a humanitarian disaster this
winter in the Serbian province come true.
	   In a report to the Austrian Cabinet, Interior Minister Karl
Schloegl said the task force should maintain an office in the
Kosovo capital Pristina to screen refugees, plan for their movement
to asylum centers and advise member governments of the situation in
the rebellious Serbian province.
	   The United Nations and other organizations have warned of a
humanitarian disaster this winter in Kosovo, where up to 300,000
people have been displaced by fighting between Serb police and
secessionist Albanian rebels.
	   Austria and other EU member states are worried that hunger and
despair could unleash a new wave of refugees from the Balkans,
straining the resources of countries where the Kosovo Albanians
would likely seek shelter.
	   Schloegl said Austria is already having problems coping with the
influx of ethnic Albanians. He said his ministry needs additional
personnel to screen asylum seekers and a supplementary budget
allocation of five million Schillings (dlrs 417,000) to hire
Albanian interpreters and other specialists to cope with refugees
already on Austrian soil.
	   Austrian officials say the number of people of all nationalities
seeking asylum here has risen from an average of 500 per month in
1997 to 1,282 last month.
	   Schloegl said that number would increase dramatically if a hard
winter brings greater suffering to displaced people in Kosovo.

Daimler shareholders vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shareholder comment, crowd estimate. Vote to be
held after shareholder comments, expected to last until 2000-2100
GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHARINE SCHMIDT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief executive Juergen
Schrempp told shareholders preparing to vote Friday on the
megamerger with Chrysler that their company is in better shape now
than it has been for years.
	   Operating profit doubled in the first half of 1998 to 3.8
billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue projections for 1998
have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion) to 140
billion marks (dlrs 83 billion).
	   ``With DaimlerChrysler we intend to set a new standard in
earnings power, profitable growth and in helping shape the future
of our society,'' Schrempp assured shareholders. ``In doing so, we
will secure your company's independence and strengthen its
values.''
	   Schrempp, 54, made his reputation as a defender of shareholder
value by refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by
Mercedes-Benz cars _ after his predecessor Edzard Reuter ran up
record losses by expanding into a diversified conglomerate.
	   Before shareholders vote on the merger, they'll grill Schrempp
on details of the dlrs 38 billion deal, in particular about whether
he's in for a hefty pay raise.
	   Schrempp, however, evaded the issue under questioning from
reporters before the meeting opened.
	   ``The executive pay will be determined by the market,'' he said.
``I am waiting for the new management board to decide on that.''
	   The disparity in executive pay between Germany and the United
States is a chief shareholder concern going into the vote. Some
fear Daimler managers will use the merger to raise their income.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in total compensation, compared to about dlrs 2 million for
Schrempp.
	   Shareholders with union ties also worry about merger-related
layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no jobs will be
lost.
	   And there are concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. One watchdog concern is whether Schrempp
and Eaton will be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands
separate if, as planned, they share platforms and merge their
purchasing.
	   Spokesmen for Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial firm,
expected the comment phase of the shareholders meeting to extend
into the night. Their only deadline: the vote on the merger must be
held before midnight.
	   With the stakes so high, 13,000 shareholders thronged to a
Stuttgart arena, and the company expected a record 16,000 present
for the vote. Tents were set up outside to handle the overflow. A
small group of protesters stood outside handing out leaflets
objecting to the deal because both firms have a history of military
contracts.
	   Chrysler shareholders also vote on the deal Friday, but most
will vote by mail or on the Internet and the meeting in Delaware is
expected to be brief.
	   Daimler executives will be trying to appease shareholders'
concerns during the meeting not only to get approval for the
merger, but also to encourage voluntary participation in the stock
swap.
	   Both Daimler and Chrysler want 90 percent of the shareholders to
turn in their shares for shares in the new company later this
month, although they only need 75 percent. The higher level will
enable the companies to use the more favorable ``pooling of
interests'' accounting method.
	   If less than 75 percent participate, Daimler and Chrysler said
they will have to cancel the whole deal.
	   Klaus Kessler, a shareholder advocate, favored the merger, but
recommended that individual investors don't immediately exchange
their shares. The 75 percent threshold can be reached with
institutional investors, who control 80 percent of Daimler's
capital, he said, and by voluntarily swapping stocks smaller
investors risk losing an additional cash payment that will be
sought in court.

Myanmar military dismisses opposition parliament as ill conceived
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new arrest total in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government on Friday
criticized an opposition committee that claims to represent the
elected parliament but stopped short of breaking it up or arresting
members.
	   Diplomats in Yangon said they were surprised by the military's
restrained response to the establishment of the committee, as many
had expected the government would put members in jail.
	   The committee, which includes 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu Kyi, was formed Wednesday and claims to have the mandate of
195 arrested members of parliament to govern in their name.
	   ``It remains unclear which responsibilities of government this
new committee intends to take over,'' a statement from the
government said Friday. ``Under what constitution will it govern?
Will it defend Myanmar sovereignty? Will it send envoys to other
countries?''
	   Myanmar, also known, as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. Although Suu Kyi's party, the National League for
Democracy, won 82 percent of the seats in Parliament in a 1990
election, the military has never allowed the assembly to meet.
	   The NLD said Friday the military had arrested another 10 of its
members. That brings the total to 853, including 196 members of
parliament, detained by the military to prevent the opposition from
convening the assembly.
	   The military is wary, however, of arresting NLD leaders,
particularly Suu Kyi, because of the international backlash that
would provoke.
	   The government also said Friday that it found a legal
contradiction in the committee's statements.
	   The committee has proclaimed that all laws passed by the
military government since it came to power in 1988 were invalid
because the violent takeover _ in which soldiers gunned down
thousands _ was illegal.
	   But at the same time, the committee has said it was acting as
parliament until the legislature could be convened under the 1990
election law _ contradicting its statement that all post-1988 laws
are invalid.
	   ``The new committee appears to be confused even about its own
decisions,'' the government statement said.
	   ``While the NLD puzzles over these issues, the current
government will continue to shoulder the real responsibilities of
governing Myanmar,'' it said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ International attempts to cool passions
in Albania appeared to be working Friday, with only a few thousand
people heeding a call by the former president to join in massive
protest against the government headed by his rival.
	   Between 3,000-4,000 people rallied in central Skanderbeg Square
to hear ex-President Sali Berisha rail against the ``dictatorship'
of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano and call for his
resignation. There were no immediate reports of similar
demonstrations elsewhere.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that tensions that kindling violent riots early this week may be
fading.
	   Ahead of the protest, international officials urged Albanians to
remain calm.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. President Rexhep Meidani also issued a
public appeal for calm after meeting with Everts and other Western
officials.
	   Parliament was expected to discuss legal moves against Berisha
on Friday, including having him arrested on charges of staging an
attempted coup. But at the urging of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe and European Union officials, parliament
was expected to defer a decision until next week, in hopes that
would allow tempers to cool further.
	   While also appealing for calm, Berisha on Thursday accused Nano,
his longtime political foe, of seeking confrontation and of wanting
``to direct the country toward civil conflict.''
	   Berisha earlier urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries of the Cold War era. But most Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   Corruption is also rife under Nano's elected government. Still,
he is backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the unrest from
fueling other crises in the region, mainly the violence in
neighboring Kosovo province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   While the parliamentary commission moved to lift the immunity
from arrest Berisha enjoys as a member of the legislature, it
decided against removing the immunity of five of his Democratic
Party allies, pending further evidence.
	   The crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha. Nobody has claimed
responsibility for the killing, but Berisha immediately blamed
Nano.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy and restore confidence
in the nation's future.

Vietnam increases export tax on rice to prevent food shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has raised its export tax on rice
because of fears of shortages caused by a drought in some regions,
a finance ministry official said Friday.
	   The drought has forced the government to reduce its export
target of 4 million tons for 1998, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The decision, which will take effect Sept. 25, will raise the
export tax on high and medium quality rice from 1 percent to 2
percent, he said.
	   It also levied an export tax of 1.5 percent on lower quality
rice.
	   Rice exports have totaled 2.9 million tons so far this year. The
government has set a rice export quota of 150,000 tons per month
for the remaining months of this year, he said.
	   Vietnam last year exported 3.7 million tons of rice, making it
the world's second largest rice exporter after Thailand. Export
totals for this year are expected to be the same as last.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower
Friday on the back of an overnight plunge on Wall Street. Bucking
the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the key index
rebounded after falling to a 12-year low a day earlier. Philippine
shares tumbled nearly 8 percent on profit-taking sparked by a steep
fall in the stock of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. The
Philippine Stock Exchange index slumped 94.63 points, or 7.5
percent, to 1,174.61. In Indonesia, the key index closed at a
six-year low amid lingering fears that the Indonesian government
may impose capital controls. The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite
Index fell 13.804 points, or 4.8 percent, to close at 271.671. In
Tokyo, however the Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.98 points, or 0.89
percent, closing the day's trading at 13,983.12. Traders said
investors were hopeful Japan's ruling and opposition parties would
reach a compromise on banking reform before the prime minister's
U.S. visit next week. The U.S. dollar was quoted at 132.10, down
2.20 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to break an embarrassing deadlock ahead of
next week's U.S. visit, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday bowed
to opposition demands on crucial legislation to clean up Japan's
debt-laden banks. Naoto Kan, head of the largest opposition party,
said Obuchi agreed to nationalize one of Japan's largest banks, the
ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and curtail the powers of
the Ministry of Finance, widely blamed for the banking industry's
mess. Obuchi continued negotiations with the opposition leaders and
had no immediate comment. The bills are aimed at cleaning up some
76 trillion yen (dlrs 575 billion) in bad loans that have burdened
the nation's banks since the collapse of the property market in the
early 1990s. (JAPAN-BANK BILLS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank moved Friday to help the
troubled banking system by infusing more money into the economy _ a
risky move that triggered a new plunge of the ruble. Russia's new
government wants to make sure the country's banks don't fail, and
it also wants to pay overdue debts to state workers. But economists
have warned about the dangers of hyperinflation if the government
prints too much money or lowers bank reserves to meet these goals.
Prices soared 43 percent in the just the first two weeks of
September. Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman,
said the bank would print a limited amount of money to pay for some
outstanding treasury bills. In response, the ruble was nearing its
all-time low of 20 to the dollar, reached earlier this month.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief executive Juergen
Schrempp told shareholders preparing to vote Friday on the
megamerger with Chrysler that their company is in better shape now
than it has been for years. Operating profit doubled in the first
half of 1998 to 3.8 billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue
projections for 1998 have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs
79 billion) to 140 billion marks (dlrs 83 billion). Schrempp, 54,
made his reputation as a defender of shareholder value by
refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by Mercedes-Benz cars
_ after his predecessor ran up record losses by expanding into a
diversified conglomerate. Before shareholders vote on the merger,
they'll grill Schrempp on details of the dlrs 38 billion deal, in
particular about whether he's in for a hefty pay raise.
(GERMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is tightening controls of its unruly
futures markets to curb speculative trading and prevent riots by
clients cheated out of their money. This week, market regulators
closed 12 brokerages for trading violations, bringing the number of
closures this year to more than 20. The closed companies included
Champion Futures, a brokerage based in the southern boomtown of
Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, whose top executives have since
disappeared, as has 50 million yuan (dlrs 6 million) in company
funds. Angry clients attempted to storm its offices Thursday,
demanding their money back. Experts say futures markets, where
agreements are made to later buy or sell commodities or financial
instruments at a particular price, are plagued by rampant
speculation, corruption and mostly absent regulators.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In separate interrogation sessions, Chinese
police warn three dissidents not to try to set up an opposition
political party, one of those interrogated says Friday. Ren
Wanding, who spent 11 of the last 19 years in prison, said the long
questioning on Thursday succeeded in getting him to give up plans
to register the China Democracy Party branch in Beijing. Ren said
at least three of his four colleagues in the would-be China
Democracy Party's Beijing branch also had separate run-ins with
police. In the past two weeks, dissidents in five provinces who
sought to register branches of the China Democracy Party did not
meet outright refusal, sparking speculation communist leaders were
considering permitting the first legal opposition in 49 years. The
police action is part of an apparent clampdown on dissent that the
ruling Communist Party began shortly after U.S. President Bill
Clinton ended a nine-day China tour in July. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, fighting for his freedom and his political life, made a
stunning call Friday for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to step
down after 17 years in power. Just as startling, hundreds in the
crowd listening to Anwar Ibrahim responded with shouts of support,
punching their fists in the air, and chanting, ``God is great.''
Even opposition parties have not called for Mahathir to leave
office or suggested he be investigated for corruption, as Anwar did
this week in a series of increasingly scathing speeches. After
grooming Anwar as his successor, the mercurial Mahathir fired him
Sept. 2 from the posts of deputy prime minister and finance
minister, then engineered Anwar's ouster from the ruling party.
Police are investigating Anwar on allegations of sexual misconduct,
abuse of power, interfering in a police probe and leaking state
secrets. He denies the charges. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition politician Sam Rainsy
said Friday he would cooperate with the regime of strongman Hun Sen
if it would help ``put Cambodia back on its feet,'' although he
feared the government planned to kill him. Sam Rainsy on Thursday
spent his first night in more than a week outside the U.N. offices
where he took refuge after being threatened with arrest. Strongman
Hun Sen had accused him of being behind a grenade attack on his
home on Sept. 7 in which no one was hurt. Cambodian leader Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party won July 26 parliamentary elections,
but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on its own. Sam
Rainsy's party and opposition ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party accused Hun Sen of winning through fraud, and had
threatened to not attend the convening of parliament. (CAMBODIA)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two days before the Jewish New Year, Israel
resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday
amid warnings that Islamic militants were plotting to kidnap
Israeli soldiers and carry out bombings in Israeli cities. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism. In the West Bank,
Palestinians planned a mass funeral Friday for a teen-ager shot
dead the day before, apparently by a Jewish settler. In the West
Bank town of Ramallah, Hamas supporters called for a rally after
Muslim prayers Friday to protest Israel's killing of two of the
group's top fugitives, Imad and Adel Awadallah, who were shot dead
Sept. 11. Israel's public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani, said
he had received ``specific warnings'' about Hamas' plans to snatch
soldiers in retaliation. Also, Israeli media has warned of large
Hamas attacks in Israeli cities. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ President Ernesto Zedillo called the flood
disaster in southern Mexico ``grave, but under control'' and
insisted that his government was rushing aid to hundreds of
thousands affected by last week's floods. The official death toll
grew to 162 on Thursday and officials said they expect it to rise
further. Zedillo made his fourth visit to Chiapas state since
floods devastated coastal area last week, leaving some 450,000
people homeless. Shortly before Zedillo arrived, reporters saw
survivors with nothing more than the clothes on their backs crowd
around military helicopters, trying to flee. Government officials
said 250,000 people will probably have to relocate from their
lowland houses and the government may have to build as many as
25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed by the flooding.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim extremists marched
in the Bangladeshi capital Friday demanding that author Taslima
Nasrin _ who returned to the country this week after four years in
exile _ be put to death for blaspheming Islam.
	   ``Arrest infidel Taslima and hang her!'' chanted the protesters,
emerging from Dhaka's main Baitul Mukurram mosque after the Islamic
Sabbath prayers.
	   Nasrin angered fundamentalists with her novel Lajja (
``Shame''), which criticized Muslims for attacking minority Hindus
in Bangladesh following the 1992 destruction of a mosque by Hindu
zealots in neighboring India.
	   She fled the country in 1994 after former Prime Minister Khaleda
Zia's government ordered her arrest following a newspaper interview
in which she was quoted as saying that the Koran, the Islamic holy
book, should be rewritten.
	   Nasrin denied making the comments, but said she favored legal
changes to give more rights to women in her male-dominated,
predominately Muslim society.
	   On Friday, the largest group of 500 protesters, wearing white
prayer caps, were from the Islamic Constitution Movement. Another
300 protesters who demonstrated separately were from three other
Islamic groups.
	   Police equipped with riot gear watched the demonstrations, but
there was no confrontation.
	   A liberal writer's group has welcomed Nasrin's controversial
homecoming.
	   ``She has every right to return to our country and freely
express her views,'' Bangladesh Writers' Forum said in a statement
Friday.
	   Nasrin faces trial in a 1994 blasphemy case, she is on bail and
has no restrictions on living in her predominantly Muslim country,
and the government has shown no interest in going through with a
trial.
	   Nasrin, living under death threats from Islamic zealots,
returned home Monday after four years of exile in Europe.
	   She accompanied her mother, who had been treated for colon
cancer in a New York hospital. Saying doctors have given her only
two months to survive, Nasrin's mother Eid-ul-Ara Begum said she
wants her daughter to nurse her.
	   According to the 36-year-old novelist's whereabouts have been
kept secret for her security, a family member told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.

Sri Lanka's guns fall silent, but British rockers cancel visit to
</HEADLINE>
war zone
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's 15-year-old civil war
paused briefly Friday to allow health workers to vaccinate children
against polio, but two British rock stars who are helping with the
campaign will stay out of the war zone.
	   Ian Dury of Blockheads fame and former Take That idol Robbie
Williams canceled their visit to northern Jaffna city, said Colin
Glennie, resident representative of UNICEF in Sri Lanka.
	   ``They will be taking part in the immunization campaign, but it
has not yet been decided exactly where they will visit,'' said
Glennie. The two arrived in the Indian Ocean island on Thursday.
	   The vaccination starts Saturday, but the cease-fire began a day
earlier to allow health workers time to transport the vaccine to
the war zones.
	   A military spokesman confirmed that the truce was holding.
	   Dury and Williams were scheduled to visit Jaffna, which is
isolated from other government-held areas, to visit clinics and
vaccinate children.
	   But it was decided they wouldn't do so after a Sept. 11 bomb
explosion in Jaffna that killed 12 people, including the town's
mayor and the area's army and police commanders.
	   The rebels and the government have agreed to a request by UNICEF
to observe Sept. 18, 19, and Oct. 23 and 24 as ``days of
tranquility.''
	   ``We expect another successful immunization campaign, with the
cooperation of all sides,'' Glennie said.
	   This is the fourth straight year that the two sides have ceased
fire for the oral immunization of all children under five years. A
total of 1.8 million children will be vaccinated, but it wasn't
immediately clear how many are in the war zones.
	   The rebels say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority can only prosper in an
independent own homeland in the north and east, separate from the
areas where the Sinhalese majority predominates. Many of Sri
Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the
population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination, though few
support the extreme solution proposed by the rebels.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the war.

St. Petersburg mayor agrees to be questioned in France, but not
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The former mayor of St. Petersburg, who now lives
in Paris, agreed Friday to be questioned regarding corruption
allegations against him, but said prosecutors would have to travel
to France, a news report said.
	   Anatoly Sobchak has been in France since undergoing heart
surgery in Paris in November. He has said repeatedly that he will
not return to Russia until the general prosecutor clears him.
	   Sobchak, who held office from 1991-96, faces charges of bribery
and abuse of power. Before he left Russia, prosecutors warned him
he would face corruption charges.
	   Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov has promised not to
detain Sobchak if he returned to Russia for questioning, Sobchak
said. But the ex-mayor said he had ``no reasons to trust Skuratov
and cannot tell the investigators anything new,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   However, Sobchak told Interfax he would be ``glad'' to meet with
Skuratov in Paris.
	   A former law professor, Sobchak was one of the leaders of
Russia's reform movement in the late 1980s.
	   Russian media reports, citing law enforcement officials, have
said he was under investigation for allegedly arranging to have his
apartment upgraded and for accepting another apartment as a gift
for his niece. A real estate company allegedly received privileges
from city authorities in return.
	   Sobchak has denied the accusations.

Russian border guards kill two infiltrators at Tajik-Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards shot and killed two
unidentified gunmen who tried to cross the border from Afghanistan
into Tajikistan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   The third intruder was forced to retreat into Afghanistan after
the shootout Thursday evening, the report said. Border guards have
found two submachine guns and some ammunition at the scene.
	   The 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan supported the government
during a five-year civil war that formally ended last year. The
troops have remained to guard against smugglers bringing drugs and
weapons from Afghanistan.

Mahathir says dlrs 3 billion has returned from Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
says nearly dlrs 3 billion worth of Malaysian ringgit has been
returned from accounts in neighboring Singapore in the past two
weeks, helping make loans easier.
	   ``Now we have a lot of money in circulation, the liquidity
problem is mostly resolved,'' he was quoted as saying by Malaysian
media reports Friday. ``And if the banks don't lend, we'll check on
the banks.''
	   The central bank last week ordered commercial banks to extend
fresh credit at a rate of at least 8 percent a year to get
Malaysia's recession-hit economy back on track.
	   Faced with its worst economic downturn in more than three
decades, Malaysia introduced sweeping currency curbs on Sept. 1 to
halt the slide of its currency, the ringgit, and isolate the
country from stock speculators. The curbs peg the ringgit to 3.8 to
the U.S. dollar.
	   Singapore, the main financial center for Malaysian securities,
has been hit hardest by the curbs, which ban trading of Malaysian
stocks offshore and effectively render ringgit outside the country
worthless after Sept. 30.
	   ``The ringgit has come back,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying
about the 11 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.89 billion) he said had
flooded back into the country.
	   The move comes amid a widening rift between the two Southeast
Asian neighbors, embroiled in a series of disputes over a water
supply agreement and a railway border post.
	   Malaysia Thursday banned Singapore Air Force planes from
entering its airspace.
	   Malaysia denied the move was retaliation for the release of
memoirs this week by Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew. The
book, ``The Singapore Story,'' is deeply critical of Malaysian
leadership.

Two militants, 30 kilograms of explosives seized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Two suspected militants with some 30
kilograms (66 pounds) of explosives were captured overnight in
violence-prone Kashmir, police said Friday.
	   Police Superintendent B.L. Pandita said the two were taken from
a house near Jammu, winter capital of Indian-held Kashmir. He said
they were members of a Sikh militant group.
	   Further north in the state's summer capital of Srinagar Friday,
19 political leaders opposed to Indian rule held a sit-down
demonstration to protest the death a day earlier of a 10-year-old.
	   Police said the boy who was caught in crossfire during a clash
between Indian troops and Muslim militants, but witnesses said the
firing near a school just north of Srinagar was unprovoked.
	   Police broke up Friday's demonstration, firing tear gas and
beating the protesters and a crowd that had gathered to watch. The
protest leaders were briefly detained.
	   Police say militants seeking a separate state for adherents of
the Sikh religion are increasingly cooperating with other groups
seeking Kashmir's independence because of their mutual hatred for
the Indian government.
	   Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 to sever the far
northern territory of Kashmir, this predominately Hindu country's
only Muslim-majority state, from India. In Punjab, south of
Kashmir, Sikhs led a 10-year rebellion for a separate state that
was declared crushed five years ago but which still occasionally
flares.
	   The Sikh religion grew out of a Hindu reform movement in the
15th and 16th centuries. Sikhs are about two percent and Muslim's
about 11 percent of India's population of nearly 1 billion.

Hundreds of thousands hold funeral for slain Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured
into the streets Friday to take part in a funeral procession for
diplomats killed by fighters of Afghanistan's Taliban militia.
	   Chanting ``death to the Taliban'' and ``death to America,'' the
protesters carried six coffins, cloaked in Iran's red, white and
green flag, to Tehran University, where Friday prayers were held.
	   The coffins were then taken to the sprawling cemetery of
Behesht-e-Zahra in south Tehran and buried near the tomb of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.
	   Demonstrations against the Taliban were also held in the cities
of Mashhad, Arak, and Tabriz, the Islamic Republic News Agency
said.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
admitted Sept. 10 to killing eight diplomats and a journalist for
the Islamic Republic News Agency after its forces captured the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran Monday.
However, Iranian radio reported Friday that the Foreign Ministry
could not identify the body of one diplomat and asked the
International Committee of the Red Cross to try to help.
	   The killings brought to a head simmering tension between Iran
and the Taliban. Iran has since massed tens of thousands of troops
on its border with Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has put the military on full alert.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the border region
to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The demonstrators ``lashed out at the Taliban's heinous crimes
and brutal acts and declared their readiness to implement the
leader's commands,'' the Iranian news agency reported.
	   At Tehran University, Zabihullah Bakhshi, a member of the
militant Ansar-e Hezbollah group, set his hand on one coffin.
	   ``We will get your revenge. We will not let your blood go to
waste,'' he shouted, dressed in camouflage and carrying a rifle.
	   A statement read at the end of the funerals called on the
Iranian government to provide Afghans living in Iran with weapons
to ``fight the backward Taliban militia in Afghanistan.''
	   It also called for the immediate release of other Iranian
nationals held captive by the Taliban. Iran says 60 of its
nationals are held by the Taliban on suspicion of arms smuggling.
	   The demonstrators called on Pakistan to end its support for the
Taliban. Pakistan is widely believed to provide military and other
support to the religious army. Iran is suspected of backing the
opposition, which largely represents the country's minority ethnic
and religious groups, including minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Iran has also accused Pakistani intelligence forces of helping
the Taliban storm the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif last
month and capturing the diplomats.
	   Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack.

Unionists reject compulsory pay cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Union leaders at the Hong Kong Telecom, one of
Hong Kong's largest employers, on Friday rejected across-the-board
pay cuts imposed by the company.
	   Terry Ip, chairman of the Hong Kong Telephone Co. Staff Union,
told reporters that union leaders reject company claims that the
cuts are needed to help it straddle lean economic times.
	   Late Thursday, the company, one of the biggest private sector
employer, said all of its 13,800 employees would have to accept a
10 percent pay cut starting Nov. 1, or be laid off.
	   Telecom's Chief Executive Linus Cheung said the company would
have to lay off thousands of people if employees do not accept the
cuts, which would save the company 300 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 38.46 million) a year.
	   The news came hours after the government announced unemployment
had climbed to a 15-year high of 5 percent.
	   Several companies, including the Telecom's rival, New T and T,
investment banks Warburg Dillon Read and Nikko Securities, and
cargo handler Hong Kong International Terminals, have announced
staff cuts this week.
	   On Thursday, thousands of people lined up outside a soon-to-be
opened department store to apply for the 400 openings, a situation
the Hong Kong Standard newspaper said had never occurred here in
living memory.
	   Unionists and workers fear the Telecom's decision may trigger
off a new round of salary cuts across Hong Kong.
	   The mass circulation Apple Daily said in an editorial that most
companies which have cut salaries are medium-sized, but now the
Telecom has ``given other companies a good excuse to follow suit.''
	   Legislator Chan Yuen-han, also an official of the Federation of
Trade Unions, Hong Kong's largest union, told reporters after a
meeting with Telecom managers that the company's terms were not
acceptable, and asked employees not to accept the cuts.
	   She and several other unionists have requested a meeting with
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to discuss the issue next week, a
spokeswoman for Tung said.
	   Several smaller firms, including G2000 and Crocodile, two major
Hong Kong chain clothing retailers, already have cut pay by up to
25 percent, media reports said.

Hoddle contract on agenda at FA talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle faces the
Football Association's international committee Friday with his
controversial book and his future high on the agenda.
	   Hoddle is scheduled to present his post-World Cup report to the
12-man committee. Contract talks are expected to continue over the
next month.
	   F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly said Hoddle's World Cup diary
would be discussed at the meeting because it had ``contributed to a
general climate that is unfortunate.''
	   He said the ``obvious pressure points in Hoddle's stewardship''
will be debated.
	   ``We are pleased we got to the World Cup finals. After that it
is very subjective,'' he was quoted saying in the Daily Telegraph
newspaper.
	   Hoddle's tenure as coach has become increasingly uncertain after
a Euro qualifier loss to Sweden and public backlash over his World
Cup diary and links with faith healer Eileen Drewery.
	   Since the World Cup, where England was eliminated in the second
round after a penalty shootout against Argentina, Hoddle has come
under fire for allegedly betraying the confidences of players in
his World Cup diary and for relying on Drewery in team preparation.
	   However, Kelly said he was certain Hoddle would continue his
current contract and confirmed talks were progressing on extending
his contract to take in the 2002 World Cup.
	   Hoddle has recently been linked with a move to his old club,
Tottenham, to replace Christian Gross as manager.
	   Hoddle has rejected calls for his resignation and said he would
consider a contract extension.
	   ``...you get criticised in the job. I've been criticised in the
past and it'll happen in the future no doubt. The bottom line is
that we've got to respond,'' he said after the 2-1 loss to Sweden.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Shanghai
dissidents applying to form party; picks up 10th graf pvs `Other
dissidents ... '

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In separate interrogation sessions of three hours
or more, Chinese police warned three dissidents not to try to set
up an opposition political party, one of those interrogated said
Friday.
	   Ren Wanding _ one of the dissident community's most prominent
figures _ said his Thursday night detention and questioning
persuaded him to give up plans to apply to register the China
Democracy Party's Beijing branch.
	   Police ``told me: `Now we're still under the Communist Party's
leadership. Setting up political parties is not permitted,''' said
Ren, who has spent 11 of the past 19 years in prison.
	   At least three of Ren's four colleagues in the would-be Beijing
branch had separate run-ins with police. Ma Shaohua and Wang Linhai
were interrogated for three to four hours Wednesday and Thursday
nights, while police ransacked the home of Zhao Xin, who was out of
town, Ren said.
	   Despite the apparent retreat in Beijing and his own five-hour
detention Thursday in Shanghai, Yao Zhenxian and four other
democracy campaigners mailed an application Friday to register the
party's Shanghai branch, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Attempts to set up the China Democracy Party and police actions
to intimidate party organizers are the latest battle line in an
apparent attempt by communist leaders to clamp down on dissent.
	   Since mid-July, after U.S. President Bill Clinton's nine-day
China tour, police have rounded up, mostly for short periods of
time, more than two dozen democracy and labor rights campaigners.
	   Most of the detentions were connected to the China Democracy
Party. Twelve people were detained, and later released, in Zhejiang
province after the first attempt to register the party in late
June.
	   But in the past two weeks, dissidents in five other provinces
sought again to register party branches. When they did not meet
outright refusal, dissidents speculated that communist leaders were
considering permitting the first legal opposition in 49 years.
	   Ren Wanding, the Beijing dissident, said his police
interrogators indicated to him that the prohibition on forming
political parties applied nationwide.
	   Other dissidents have reported stepped up surveillance and
harassment by police since Clinton left China.
	   Police burst into Jia Wei's home in northeastern Changchun city,
arguing and ransacking the place on Tuesday morning, the fourth
time in 2 1/2 months, New York-based Human Rights in China reported
Friday.
	   On Wednesday, they made another of their repeated visits to the
offices of his older brother and sister, the group said.
	   Jia Wei traveled to Beijing to try to give political tracts to
Clinton in June but was detained and taken back to Changchun in
custody, Human Rights in China said.

Thai politicians and health officials linked in medicine scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An independent fact-finding committee
said Friday it has found at least two politicians and several
senior bureaucrats were involved in a drug price-fixing scam at
Thailand's hospitals, but refused to divulge their names.
	   ``My job was to find whether there was corruption at the
ministry and the answer is yes. But further actions against the
wrongdoers must be done by the government,'' Dr. Banlu Siripanich,
the committee chairman, told reporters.
	   The committee was appointed by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
after a rural doctors association charged that hospitals were being
forced by the Ministry of Health to buy drugs at inflated prices
from pre-selected companies.
	   ``My team completed its duty of finding the facts. With no legal
power, we can just make a report to the prime minister,'' he said.
	   Recent polls show the scandal had damaged the government's
reputation for honesty, and some have criticized the appointment of
the panel precisely because it has no legal power.
	   The corruption involved a 1.4 billion baht budget set up for the
ministry to cover the purchase of medicines and supplies for state
hospitals nationwide.
	   Despite the resignation of the health minister on Monday, public
discontent is growing amid demands the prime minister root out
corruption at the ministry.
	   Chuan said, however, he would not act until he received the
committee's report, but promised to punish every wrongdoer no
matter what position they hold.
	   ``Whoever they are, they deserve punishment,'' Chuan told
reporters.

Beijing announces it will station troops in Macau after handover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China announced Friday it will station troops in
Macau when the Portuguese territory returns to Chinese rule in 15
months.
	   Speaking at a meeting preparing for the transfer of power, Vice
Premier Qian Qichen said the elite detachment of soldiers will
symbolize China's sovereignty over Macau and protect social order
and economic development, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   The report gave no details about the number of People's
Liberation Army troops to be stationed or where they would be
housed after the Dec. 20, 1999 handover.
	   Beijing stationed 4,700 soldiers in Hong Kong after resuming
sovereignty from Britain on July 1, 1997.
	   The decision to open a PLA garrison in Hong Kong initially
provoked unease in the freewheeling capitalist enclave, many of
whose residents are refugees from communism.
	   The announcement by Qian, chairman of the government-backed
Macau Preparatory Committee, got a big round of applause from
committee members, Xinhua said. The committee is made up of 60
Macau residents and 40 mainland Chinese, all approved by Beijing.
	   Emphasizing Beijing's concern about the recent spread of
gang-related violence in Macau, Qian said Macau authorities were
responsible for protecting social order before the handover.
	   He also said the committee would propose measures to support the
Macau government's fight against violence.
	   The tiny Portuguese enclave 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of
Hong Kong, long famous for its gambling and tourism, has been hit
with gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks, many
targeting government officials.
	   Police blame gang wars over payoffs from casinos whose profits
have been shrinking in Asia's economic slump.

Prime minister: Ireland wants to strenghten trade ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Ireland is eager to strengthen business ties
with Hong Kong, visiting Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said
Friday.
	   ``I am confident that many new business opportunities will be
realized as a result of my visit,'' Ahern told a lunch meeting
organized by the Irish Business Forum.
	   He said Hong Kong has been an important gateway to mainland
China, pointing out that a decade ago Ireland's exports to the
territory ``hardly covered half our imports.''
	   ``It is now our 22nd largest export market, a bigger customer
than many European and Middle Eastern countries,'' he said.
	   Ahern also met with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, the leader
picked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after it regained the
territory's sovereignty from Britain last year, and two opposition
lawmakers, Martin Lee and Emily Lau.
	   A government statement said Ahern told Tung that he was
impressed by steps taken by the Chinese government to rehouse
victims of recent floods in China.
	   It said Tung assured the Irish Prime Minister that Hong Kong was
committed to maintaining a free market.
	   The government last month intervened in the financial markets to
prop up share prices and defend the Hong Kong currency, raising
concerns that the move would damage the territory's reputation for
having one of the freest markets in the world.
	   Ahern arrived late Thursday on the last leg of his weeklong
visit to mainland China. He was the first Irish prime minister to
visit China since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1979.

Minister accused of scandal denies taking kickbacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus' interior minister was accused
Friday of illegally amassing the equivalent of millions of dollars
in a scandal that has gripped the eastern Mediterranean island.
	   The minister, Dinos Michaelides, denied the charges and said the
accusations were made to destroy his political career.
	   The accusations came from Christos Pourgourides, the chairman of
the parliament's Audit and Ethics Committee.
	   Pourgourides said he was approached by a close friend and
business partner of the minister who supplied him with details of
Michaelides' illegal deals. He said he looked into each case.
	   Pourgourides delivered the report to President Glafcos Clerides.
Government officials said the charges would be investigated.

Queen Elizabeth pays respect to Islam during Brunei visit

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II slipped
off her white pumps, donned a white prayer robe and gingerly padded
about one of the most magnificent mosques in modern Islam on
Friday.
	   The queen began her second day of her state visit to this
oil-rich sultanate, a former British colony on the northern tip of
Borneo island, by paying respects to Islam. Most of the 312,000
people in this tiny Southeast Asian kingdom are Muslim.
	   Wearing a blue, wide-brimmed hat and floor-length prayer robe
designed for her back in London, the queen was escorted through the
Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque.
	   In the cavernous male prayer room, some 150 men sat
crossed-legged on their golden prayer rugs in identical black felt
``songkok'' caps and embroidered sarongs as the queen strolled
behind them in her stocking feet.
	   Her gloved hands clasped, the queen softly inquired about the
gold-plated Arabic calligraphy of Koranic verse carved into the
white Italian marble.
	   The mosque covers 20 acres (8 hectares), with 29 marble domes
and 29 white marble steps, symbolizing Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the
29th Sultan of the 600-year-old Bolkiah dynasty.
	   The queen walked through the lower courtyard to visit hundreds
of children _ girls in pink Muslim head scarves and boys in black
caps _ kneeling in front of wooden stands cradling tiny Korans.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his new wife, Gaynor
Regan, were among those in the queen's entourage, all in stocking
feet, the women in black prayer robes.
	   Zaini Ali, the mosque architect who escorted the queen, said she
was most impressed by a compulsory pre-marital counseling class.
	   ``She was jumping up and down, she was so excited,'' said the
British-trained architect. He said the queen turned to Cook and
said, ``We should try something like this.''
	   The Church of England does not require marriage counseling. The
children of the royal couple _ celebrating their 50th wedding
anniversary last year _ have been plagued by divorce, perhaps the
most infamous between Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.
	   Zaini may not have known his comments would raise gleeful
eyebrows among the British press on the tour. The tabloids have
skewered Cook for recently leaving his wife of 28 years and
marrying his former aide.
	   In Buckingham Palace's push to promote the British royals as
more people-friendly, the queen also visited a health-care clinic
for women and children along the Brunei River.
	   The clinic, which practices preventative care, sits in Kampong
Ayer, or Water Village, a settlement of 2,500 rickety wooden houses
on river stilts. The small villages linked by foot-bridges dates
back to the 16th century and was the capital of Brunei until the
turn of the century.
	   Though the queen did not reach out to touch any of the babies,
in the much-admired style of Princess Diana, the mothers in their
neon-bright head scarves and nurses in crisp white uniforms were
thrilled to have met her.
	   Like many Asians with dark eyes, they commented on the deepness
of the queen's blue eyes.
	   ``I'm quite sure they're as excited as I am,'' said Dy Ooi Poh
Sim, the head nurse who was trembling after having given the queen
the tour.
	   The royal couple is on their first state visit to Brunei since
1972, 12 years before the sultanate gained full independence from
the United Kingdom.

China to fly flags at half-staff for dead President Yang
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will commemorate the death of former
President Yang Shangkun by flying flags at half-staff, the official
Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
	   Flags at Tiananmen Square, symbol of the communist revolution,
all government offices, ports and embassies worldwide will fly at
half-staff Monday, the day Yang is to be cremated, Xinhua said.
	   Yang, a veteran revolutionary and long an ally of party
patriarch Deng Xiaoping, died Monday in Beijing of an undisclosed
illness at the age of 91.
	   Yang served as president, a largely ceremonial post, from 1988
to 1992 when an ailing Deng, worried about his ally's growing
power, engineered his retirement.
	   Despite that downfall, Yang remained an influential party elder,
one of the coterie of powerful, aged veterans known as the ``Eight
Immortals.''
	   State media have run a series of reports eulogizing Yang. On
Friday, major national dailies ran a Xinhua article praising Yang
for keeping an interest in state affairs even though he was sick
and in hospital.
	   ``I am very happy you have the right ways for flood control,''
Yang was quoted as telling Premier Zhu Rongji after discussing
attempts to contain catastrophic summerlong flooding.

Pakistan shuts border to Afghanistan to stop flow of religious

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   TORKHAM, Pakistan (AP) _ Wracked by bitter feuding between rival
Islamic sects, Pakistan on Friday shut its border with neighboring
Afghanistan to try to stop the inflow of militant Muslims.
	   The steel gates that separate Afghanistan and Pakistan have been
padlocked and only Afghans with ``proper travel documents and
tribesmen'' are being allowed to cross, said border agent Bashir
Wazir.
	   Until Friday, the gates were wide open fore free travel.
	   But in recent days militant Sunni Muslims, many of whom are
believed to have links with the radical Taliban religious army that
rules Afghanistan, have been staging demonstrations in Pakistan.
	   They have burned down Shiite Muslim mosques, attacked police and
threatened to storm jails where many of their activists are being
held.
	   In the last one week there have been almost daily killings by
feuding Sunni and Shiite Muslims.
	   Police in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province where most of the
killings have occurred has arrested an estimated 400 members of
militant Muslim groups. Members from both sects of Islam were
arrested.
	   Most Pakistanis are Sunni Muslims, like most Afghans. While most
get along, the members of rival militant groups routinely clash.
	   The militant Sunni group in Pakistan, Sipah-e-Sahaba or
Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet, accuses Iran of arming and
financing their Shiite Muslim rivals.
	   The Taliban too accuses Iran of sending military equipment to
its Shiite Muslim opponents belonging to the Hezb-e-Wahadat group.
	   ``We are checking everyone and are being very vigilante about
foreigners and Pakistanis traveling to and from Afghanistan,'' said
Wazir.
	   A senior government official, who refused to be named, said
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government feared that the Sunni
Muslim militants wreaking havoc in Pakistan were being trained in
camps in Afghanistan.
	   However, he refused to blame the Taliban religious militia,
which is considered a close ally of Pakistan. Pakistan is one of
only three countries to recognize the Taliban government in
Afghanistan.
	   There are reports of hundreds of Pakistanis, many of them
graduates of religious schools in the northwest frontier province,
fighting alongside the Taliban army.
	   Several Pakistanis were among the 26 people reportedly killed
when U.S. missiles struck alleged training camps in eastern
Afghanistan on Aug. 20.

Ukrainian opposition denounces detention of prominent politician
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian opposition movement said Friday
the detention of one of its members on suspicion of embezzlement
was a political move by the authorities.
	   Mykola Syvulskiy, a member of the centrist Hromada party and
former deputy finance minister and deputy central bank chief, was
detained Thursday, the chief prosecutor's office said.
	   He is suspected of transferring more than dlrs 5 million from
the accounts of the state gas company Ukrgazprom to a private gas
and energy trader, Unified Energy Systems.
	   ``This is a ... a mockery of the people living in the country,''
Julia Timoshenko, a Hromada leader, said in parliament.
	   Timoshenko called Syvulskiy a ``perfectly honest man'' who was
``thrown behind bars under orders from the president and his
closest entourage,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Syvulskiy holds a senior post in the shadow cabinet formed last
year by Hromada and headed by Timoshenko, and has been active in
trying to organize a referendum on President Leonid Kuchma's
resignation.
	   Syvulskiy's referendum headquarters said Friday it would
continue his work.
	   ``Every day that Leonid Kuchma stays in power is leading to a
political, social and economic catastrophe,'' it said.
	   The detention was the latest chapter in a massive investigation
launched by state prosecutors recently against Hromada leader and
former premier Pavlo Lazarenko.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97 and reaping huge
profits from gas imports to Ukraine by giving the UES preferential
status in the country's gas market during his term in office.
	   Tax authorities recently fined UES 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 500
million) for evading tax payments and illegally transferring abroad
money received from gas sales.
	   UES has appealed, and the case was sent to the Supreme
Arbitration Court.

Officials see little hope of reviving Philippine Airlines

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government officials and executives
of ailing Philippine Airlines held out little hope Friday of
stopping the closure of Asia's oldest carrier.
	   On Thursday, the carrier announced it will halt operations next
week after 57 years because of its unions' rejection of a
management-proposed rescue plan.
	   The closure of the flag carrier would be a devastating blow to
the country, leaving many areas of the sprawling archipelago of
7,000 islands without air service.
	   In a further blow, two smaller airlines were grounded Friday.
	   Regulators suspended Air Philippines, the country's
second-largest airline, for failure to comply with safety
standards.
	   Grand International Airways, a smaller carrier, canceled its
flights because of unpaid insurance and fuel bills, employees said.
	   President Joseph Estrada met separately with Philippine Airlines
majority owner Lucio Tan and union officials to try to broker a
last-minute deal to save the airline.
	   But Estrada's executive secretary, Ronald Zamora, said the
ground workers' union rejected the president's proposal for a
referendum among union members on whether to accept the management
proposal.
	   Philippine Airlines has offered workers 20 percent ownership of
the company in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreements _ a condition which officials of
all three PAL unions say is unacceptable.
	   ``If you try to take away the soul of the union, we will have to
uphold our principles,'' said Abel Capili, a board member of the
ground workers' union. ``We may have to accept the closure of
PAL.''
	   Zamora said no more meetings were scheduled with either side.
	   ``I think management is not going to change its mind about the
closure,'' he said.
	   PAL has been devastated by a series of strikes and by Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   During a crippling 22-day pilots' strike in June it fired the
pilots, cut most of its routes and laid off 5,000 of its nearly
14,000 workers. But the layoffs triggered a strike by ground
personnel.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said some hope still
remained that the airline could survive, but ``as we come closer to
the deadline, the possibility of stopping the closure becomes
dimmer.''
	   He said the unions would have to make ``a big move'' to stop the
closure process.
	   The management proposal gives workers three seats on PAL's
board. Each worker would receive 60,000 shares of stock worth
300,000 pesos (about dlrs 6,900).
	   Even with the support of the unions, the airlines' creditors,
owed dlrs 2.1 billion, might withdraw their support if they feel
the viability of the airline is in doubt, Aquino said.
	   Foreign creditors have loaned the airline about dlrs 1.6
billion, with the bulk coming from a consortium of European banks
led by Credit Agricole Indosuez to help finance the fleet
modernization program.

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Chanting ``blow up, blow up Tel
Aviv,'' thousands of Hamas supporters on Friday exhorted the
group's bomb makers to attack Israelis in retaliation for the
killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israel.
	   Israel resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip
ahead of the Jewish Near Year and amid warnings that Hamas planned
to kidnap Israeli soldiers and detonate bombs in Israeli cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   The heightened tensions came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made a
final effort to salvage his peace mission and narrow the gaps
between Israel and the Palestinians on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Ross met with Arafat in Gaza City on Friday afternoon, ahead of
his return to Washington on Saturday. It was no clear whether the
envoy would hold a final round of talks with Netanyahu.
	   The Hamas rally in El Bireh, the hometown of slain fugitives
Imad and Adel Awadallah, drew some 3,000 people after Muslim noon
prayers Friday. The Awadallah brothers, who had been involved in
plotting suicide bombings in Israel, were shot dead in an Israeli
army raid of their hideout near Hebron on Sept. 11.
	   Shaking their fists in anger, the marchers demanded that the
killings be avenged by the new chief bombmaker, known as Abu Hunud.
	   ``Abu Hunud, blow up, blow up Tel Aviv,'' the crowd chanted.
``Abu Hunud, oh hero, we want you to kidnap Israeli soldiers.''
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the Awadallah
brothers, and Israel army radio said there was concern that Hamas
would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force
Israel to release the bodies.
	   Israel's public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani, said he had
received ``specific warnings'' about Hamas plans to snatch
soldiers.
	   Israeli media warned of large-scale Hamas attacks in Israeli
cities. One Israeli newspaper wrote that Hamas planned to set off
car bombs in major Israeli cities. A headline in another paper
screamed, ``Hamas plans an attack like Kenya,'' referring to last
month's explosion that wrecked the American Embassy in Nairobi.
	   Also Friday, about 600 mourners joined the funeral procession of
17-year-old Iyad Kabasma who was shot dead the day before,
apparently by a Jewish settler, in the West Bank village of
Beitunia.
	   Witnesses said Kabasma was killed and another teen-ager wounded
when they were fired on from a car with Israeli license plates.
	   The suspect, a 35-year-old resident of the Dolev settlement, had
turned himself in on Thursday, several hours after the shooting.
	   On Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect held for
eight days while the investigation continues. The suspect said his
car was attacked by Palestinian rock-throwers. He told police that
he fired in the air, and was not aware that anyone was hit.
	   The Israeli army announced that it was reimposing a complete
closure of the West Bank and Gaza, starting at 4 p.m. (1400 gmt)
Friday. The restrictions, which bar all Palestinians from entering
Israel, will not be lifted before Wednesday morning, the end of the
two-day Near Year's holiday.
	   Israel had imposed a blanket closure after the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but gradually eased it, allowing 17,000 workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.

Hochtief chosen to negotiate on expansion at Berlin airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The public holding company planning the expansion
of Schoenefeld airport chose a consortium led by the German
construction firm Hochtief on Friday as the preferred bidder for
the project.
	   The Hochtief group _ which also includes ABB Calor Schaltanlagen
AG, the operator of the Frankfurt airport and a Berlin bank,
Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG _ beat out another consortium whose
partners included the operator of the Vienna airport and the French
depository bank Caisse des Depots.
	   But Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, who chairs the board of the
holding company that owns and operates Berlin's three airports,
said the decision to work with Hochtief could change depending on
how negotiations over details proceed.
	   Schoenefeld, former East Berlin's main airport, is to be
privatized and expanded into a major international hub by 2007,
with all passenger traffic to Germany's new capital concentrated
there.
	   The consortium will pay 650 million marks (dlrs 385 million) to
the government holding company for the right to build and operate
Schoenefeld for 50 years.

Chief election official warns Bosnian Serbs about premature

celebrations of election win &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The chief international
election official warned Bosnian Serb radicals Friday against
celebrating their self-declared electoral victory, hinting they
could face punishment if demonstrations continue.
	   Cheering supporters of Nikola Poplasen have been celebrating in
Bosnian Serb towns, proclaiming that the leader of the Serb Radical
Party defeated the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in last
weekend's vote for president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Western officials admit Plavsic is trailing but have refused to
release any figures from the Saturday-Sunday balloting, citing a
complicated ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the need
for accuracy.
	   But a Poplasen victory would be a humiliating setback for U.S.
and European efforts to rebuild Bosnia-Herzegovina after the 3
1/2-year war which ended with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   A win by Poplasen, an ally of indicted war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic, would call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   ``We are in the process of suggesting to the (Serb) Radical
party and to Mr. Poplasen that it would not be in his interest to
have these demonstrations,'' said Robert Barry, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe office here.
	   Barry said that if protests continue, ``we will have to take
them into account in terms of our reaction.'' The OSCE, which
supervised the election, has the authority to disqualify candidates
of parties which violate campaign rules.
	   He refused to say whether OSCE was prepared to do that but
added, ``we cannot allow efforts to intimidate this process to go
on.''
	   Western officials admit that disqualifying Poplasen could
trigger a violent reaction among his followers and threaten the
entire Bosnian peace process. Bosnian Serbs have urged OSCE to
release results, although Barry's office said that could take
another five or six days.
	   In the Bosnian Serb city of Banja Luka, an official of
Poplasen's party, Pantelija Damjanovic, warned that if the OSCE
``comes up with an unjust decision,'' it would ``cause grave
problems and great evil... We shall await the decision, hoping it
will not be unjust.''
	   But a Plavsic ally, Milorad Dodik, urged the OSCE to disqualify
Poplasen for violating campaign rules by granting an interview to
Serb television after the deadline for such broadcasts.
	   Dodik, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic, said he
was willing to accept disqualification for his own breach of the
rules -- giving an interview to a local newspaper after the
deadline.
	   ``It would be an act of personal responsibility and a gesture of
basic democratic behavior,'' Dodik said. ``I think the OSCE should
be consistent and take off presidential candidate... Nikola
Poplasen. His television interview was a more drastic breach of
election law that my interview published in a limited-circulation
daily.''
	   He said that would show that OSCE was taking an ``unbiased
approach.''
	   Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Bosnia's top international
mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said his office would ``respect the
will of the people.''
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists at the
election, despite international efforts to boost Plavsic and her
coalition by supplying millions of dollars of economic aid.
	   Analysts believe that nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs
has been rekindled because of the clashes in the Serbian province
of Kosovo against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians.
	   Rising Western pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic over
Kosovo also hurt the pro-Western Plavsic at the polls, they said.
	   During the election, Bosnians chose candidates for the
three-member joint national presidency, a national parliament and
regional and local posts. Those in the Serb-run area also voted for
their president.

Germany rips Yugoslavia in diplomatic tiff over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany on Friday rejected Yugoslav charges
that it supports ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in
Serbia's Kosovo province and was planning a military attack.
	   Yugoslav officials accused Germany on Thursday of preparing to
launch ``genocide'' against Serbs after Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe said NATO military action could come in a matter of weeks.
	   ``We view this as a cheap propaganda show,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said. ``The implication that Germany is
acting alone or as the initiator is nonsense. It's a conscious
deception of the Yugoslav public.''
	   NATO has readied plans for possible military intervention in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province in an attempt to end Serbia's
crackdown on the ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Ruehe said on German television Tuesday that NATO could strike
``in three to five weeks,'' drawing harsh criticism from two top
Serbian officials.
	   ``Our people have to get ready for defense,'' said
ultranationalist vice premier Vojislav Seselj. ``Germany and all
its allies must be defeated if they strike against our territory.''
	   A spokesman for Serbia's ruling Socialist Party, Ivica Dacic,
accused Germany of ``openly supporting terrorists in Kosovo.''
	   ``Probably, two genocides against the Serbian people were not
enough, so they want to finish off the job,'' Dacic said, referring
to World Wars I and II when Germans and Serbs fought each other.

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank said Friday it planned to print
rubles as part of a plan to aid the troubled banking system, but
the news did nothing to aid the currency, which again plummeted.
	   Russia's new government wants to make sure the country's shaky
banks don't fail, and it also wants to pay overdue wages to state
workers.
	   But economists have warned about the dangers of hyperinflation
if the government pumps too much money into the economy to meet
these goals. Prices soared 43 percent in the just the first two
weeks of September.
	   The Central Bank invited leading Russian banks to submit lists
of all outstanding debts and said it would lower reserve
requirements for banks in relatively sound financial position.
	   That means the banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on
hand, and could settle debts, improving the overall liquidity in
the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those treasuries had been frozen by the Central Bank in a
controversial debt restructuring plan announced last month.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some treasury bills. Kozlov
wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed it would
be strictly limited.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble was down again and was nearing its all-time
low of 20 to the dollar, reached earlier this month.
	   At the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, U.S. dollars for
next-day delivery opened at 18-20 rubles in over-the-counter
trading, compared to 15 on Thursday.
	   ``I think it's because the Central Bank is likely to print
rubles,'' said Pyotr Neimyshev, chief trader at Chase Manhattan
Bank International.
	   The Russian generally supported the Central Bank's move as a way
to protect the banks.
	   ``The decision made by the Central Bank is justified,'' said the
business daily Kommersant. ``Today we already have the ruble
falling and inflation, but the nation can't live without the
banking system.''
	   The economic crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill. It also threatens to
bring broader economic activity to a halt.
	   In a move to help importers and exporters, the Central Bank on
Friday revoked its earlier order requiring them to secure
pre-payments for their transactions.
	   The move was taken ``in order to avoid shortage of staples and
medicines,'' the Central Bank said in a statement released to the
media. Many Russians stocked up on medicines when the crisis hit,
leaving pharmacy shelves bare.
	   Meanwhile, the composition and policies of the new Russian
cabinet remained in limbo Friday.
	   Adding to the confusion, a moderate lawmaker appointed deputy
prime minister in charge of social affairs earlier this week
announced Friday he was rejecting the job.
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a 32-year old deputy speaker of the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, said he lacked the
experience to handle the job during the crisis.
	   ``It would be a gamble to accept this job now when pensions and
wages are months overdue,'' Ryzhkov told reporters after meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``I wouldn't like to make
irresponsible decisions.''
	   Dealing with social affairs is considered one of the toughest
jobs in government because the state has run up huge debts to
millions of Russian workers and pensioners.
	   In another Cabinet appointment, Vadim Gustov, 50, the governor
of the St. Petersburg region was named first deputy prime minister
in charge of relations with Russia's regions.

Australia's Kounev, two English lifters win gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Kiril Kounev swept all
three gold medals Friday in 94-kilogram division weightlifting at
the Commonwealth Games, lifting a total 30 kilograms more than his
nearest rival.
	   England's Leon Griffin won two of the golds at 85 kilograms, and
teammate Stephen Ward took the other.
	   The two countries took 15 of the 18 medals at stake in Friday's
weightlifting. Matam David of Cameroon won all three bronzes in the
85-kilogram division.
	   Kounev, a 30-year-old native of Bulgaria who won a world
championship in 1989, also had swept three golds in the 1994 games,
in the 83-kilogram class.
	   This time, he beat England's Anthony Arthur 165 kilograms to
152.5 in the snatch, and outlifted England's Andrew Callard 205 to
190 in the clean and jerk and 370 to 340 in total.
	   Callard had won two golds at 99 kilograms in 1994.
	   Australia's Simon Heffernan won all three bronzes with lifts of
150 and 185 for a 335 total.
	   ``There was not much pressure from the other lifters as I was
all by myself,'' said Kounev, who started lifting when most of the
other competitors had finished.
	   At 85 kilgrams, Ward won the snatch with 157.5 to Griffin's 155.
Then Griffin, a 23-year-old motor mechanic, beat Ward 192.5 to
187.5 in the clean and jerk and 347.5 to 345 in total.
	   David had lifts of 147.5 and 180 for a 327.5 total.
	   After six divisions of weightlifting, Australia had six gold
medals to three each for England, India and Naru, two for Canada
and one for Malaysia.

Flood waters damage Philippine dike, thousands evacuated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Heavy rains destroyed a portion of a
dike protecting residents from mud flows from Mount Pinatubo on
Friday, endangering more than 100,000 people in a northern
Philippine province, officials said.
	   A massive evacuation was under way late Friday in the towns of
Guagua, Lubao and Sasmuan in Pampanga province, about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) north of Manila, they said.
	   The Office of Civil Defense said an earthen dike in Lubao was
breached as a result of continuous rains brought by a storm
northwest of the Philippines.
	   The storm, with 75 kmh (46 mph) winds, was located about 320
kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila at late afternoon and
was forecast to remain stationary for the next 24 hours, weather
forecasters said.
	   The swollen Porac-Gumain river in Pampanga overflowed a bridge
and flooded the main highway link to Subic Bay Freeport, prompting
police to set up roadblocks that stranded thousands of commuters.
	   Olive Luces, operations chief of the civil defense office, said
107,295 people in 46 villages in the three towns were at risk and
needed to be evacuated.
	   Some residents had already moved out of their villages on their
own, staying with relatives in unaffected areas, she said. The
government has deployed boats and amphibious trucks to evacuate the
others.
	   In metropolitan Manila, about 1,940 people living near flooded
rivers and creeks were evacuated to temporary shelters in
government schools, Luces said.
	   The capital and much of the main northern island of Luzon have
been drenched by rains since Sunday.
	   Authorities also suspended classes Friday for grade schools in
metropolitan Manila.
	   Mount Pinatubo's eruption in 1991 left millions of tons of
volcanic debris on its slopes which washes down into rivers during
heavy rains.

Libya calls Arab League stand on sanctions a joke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's foreign minister has dismissed as a
joke a decision this week by the Arab League to respect a six-year
U.N. ban on flights to or from Libya.
	   The minister, Omar al-Muntasser, said the decision falls short
of a stand by African countries to ignore the embargo imposed on
Libya to force it to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency said Friday.
	   The Arab League said Thursday that it would break the sanctions
as soon as the United States, Britain and Libya agree on measures
to put the two Libyan suspects on trial in the Netherlands. Until
then, its member countries should adhere to the embargo.
	   ``The decision ... by the Arab League, with regard to Lockerbie,
is a joke,'' al-Muntasser was quoted as saying by the agency.
	   In its June summit, the Organization of African Unity voted
unanimously to ignore the air sanctions. Since then, several
African leaders have flown to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

Spanish government rules out truce for truce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's security chief said Friday _ the
first day of an indefinite cease-fire declared by armed Basque
separatists _ that he had no intention of matching truce for truce.
	   ``The state can never declare a truce against a terrorist
group,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said Friday in an
interview broadcast on a local TV channel.
	   The unlimited cease-fire is the first ever for the ETA during
its bloody 30-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland.
	   The Spanish government's immediate reaction sought to temper
public expectations that the cease-fire would lead to an end of the
violence.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, in a statement Thursday during
a visit to Lima, Peru, responded with skepticism and demanded that
ETA prove its commitment to peace ``with actions and not
declarations.''
	   An editorial in leading daily El Pais Friday also called for
prudence, but added, ``Caution should not be taken to the extreme
of negating that we are in a previously unknown situation....There
are new opportunities now that never existed before.''
	   During his television interview, Mayor said ETA might be buying
time to rebuild its strength, and that the security forces should
be particularly wary of signs that the separatists were
reorganizing over the border in France.
	   The government claims that armed group is up against the ropes,
suffering from a series of police successes against its commandos
and financing network.
	   Last year's imprisonment of the entire leadership of the
ETA-allied Basque party Herri Batasuna, who were convicted of
``collaborating with terrorism,'' and July's closure of the Basque
newspaper Egin for allegedly acting as a front for the separatists,
have also reportedly weakened ETA.
	   But as well as calling for caution, and seeking to claim the
credit for forcing the truce, the government appears keen to
demonstrate that it will give the cease-fire a chance to lead to a
lasting peace.
	   ``We will begin to measure the sincerity of the cease-fire from
October 25th (election day in the Basque region),'' Mayor said in
the Antena 3 television interview. He said that by then it would be
clear whether the truce had been a mere campaign tactic in support
of Basque nationalist candidates.
	   The minister was more conciliatory in another interview Friday
on a Basque radio station, saying the government viewed the
elections as a potential guide of Basque public opinion on the
cease-fire, as well as an acid test of its sincerity.
	   ``The result is very important to determine in which direction
we go,'' he said on Radio Euskadi.
	   The cease-fire has been greeted with optimism in the northern
region, particularly from Basque nationalist leaders. Basque
nationalists, who support ETA's goal but reject the use of
violence, claim much of the credit for pressuring ETA into
declaring the truce.
	   The four-page cease-fire declaration by ETA said the move was
motivated by a new political context favorable to the formation of
a pro-independence political front in the Basque region.
	   ETA gunmen and bombs have killed nearly 800 people since the
group began fighting in the late 1960s for an independent Basque
homeland straddling the border between Spain and France.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

Nigeria invites U.N. expert to visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Intent on restoring its international image, the
Nigerian government has invited a U.N. investigator to visit the
country for the first time to check on the human rights situation.
	   U.N. spokesman Jose Diaz said Friday that Nigerian authorities
had asked Soli Sorabjee, an expert from India, to travel to the
African nation ``as soon as possible.''
	   Sorabjee will report his findings back to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. No date for his visit has been set yet.
	   Nigeria is on a special watch list at the U.N. commission for
countries accused of the most flagrant violations. However, the
late military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, refused to allow Sorabjee
into Nigeria for a first-hand investigation.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has promised to
end human rights abuses and restore democracy and civilian rule.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, in
July urged Abubakar to prove his government was serious about
respecting human rights by letting Sorabjee tour the country.

 &UR; EDs: updates with Australia-Fiji result, new material throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia scored 42 second-half points
to open the rugby union World Cup Pacific qualifying tournament
Friday with a 66-20 win over Fiji at Parramatta Stadium.
	   Earlier at the same ground, Western Samoa scored a 28-20 win
over Tonga in the first rugby union doubleheader to be played in
Australia.
	   Damian Smith and Stephen Larkham scored two tries each in
Australia's nine-try demolition of Fiji while captain John Eales
converted all the tries and kicked a penalty.
	   Australia led 24-6 lead at halftime. Solid Fijian defense kept
the Wallabies scoreless for the first 22 minutes until Smith scored
the first of Australia's three first-half tries. Winger Jason
Little fielded a George Gregan chip over the Fijian defenders to
cross in the 36th minute.
	   In the first match, it took Va'aiga Tuigamala only two minutes
to remind Australian fans of his power when he set up the
match-stealing try in the Western Samoa win over Tonga.
	   Both sides scored three tries but Samoan five-eighth Stephen
Bachop was the difference with three penalties and two conversions.
	   Former All Black winger Tuigamala came on as a replacement in
the 60th minute with Samoa leading 18-8 but under enormous pressure
from the physical Tongans.
	   Two minutes later, he charged onto a path inside the 22,
delivered on the other side of halfway with center Terry Fanolua
finishing off by crashing over in the corner. Bachop's sideline
conversion gave Samoa an unattainable 25-8 lead.
	   It was Tuigamala's first game in Australia since he played for
New Zealand here in 1992 and his fourth test for his native Samoa
since he returned to rugby two years ago following a four-year
stint in rugby league.
	   ``We haven't had a game leading up to this game so we were very
rusty and our lineout throws weren't quite finding the mark, but I
always felt we had the answers,'' said Western Samoan coach Bryan
Williams.
	   ``We turned up the heat after halftime and controlled the ball a
lot better and it started to work for us.''
	   The top three teams in the tournament qualify directly for next
year's World Cup, with the fourth getting a second chance via
another qualifying round.
	   The tournament moves to Canberra on Tuesday with Australia
meeting Tonga and Western Samoa facing Fiji at Bruce Stadium.
	   Scores:
	   AUSTRALIA 66 (Damian Smith 2, Stephen Larkham 2, Jason Little,
Owen Finegan, Joe Roff, Nathan Grey, Jeremy Paul tries, John Eales
9 goals, penalty goal) def. FIJI 20 (Sale Sorovaki, Waisale Serevi
tries, Waisale Serevi 2 goals, 2 penalty goals).
	   WESTERN SAMOA 28 (Steven So'oialo, Brian Lima, Terry Fanolua
tries, Stephen Bachop 2 goals, 3 penalty goals) def. TONGA 20
(Sonatane Koloi, Salesi Finau, Fololisi Masila tries, Piea Hola
goal, Brian Wooley penalty goal). (djp)

Former East German Politburo member Kurt Hager dead at 86
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Kurt Hager, longtime top member of former East
Germany's Politburo, the communist party's ruling body, died Friday
in Berlin. He was 86.
	   The German Communist Party made the announcement in a statement
from Essen, in western Germany. Party chairman Heinz Stehr praised
Hager as an ``aggressive anti-fascist and upstanding communist.''
	   Hager, who was charged with numerous counts of manslaughter in
the deaths of people trying to escape over East German borders to
the West, was dropped from the trial in 1996 because he was
seriously ill from cancer.
	   A member of the Politburo from 1963-89, Hager was a hardline
communist ideologist with emphasis on East Germany's
political-cultural course.
	   He stubbornly rejected democratic reforms. Commenting on the
democratic movement in eastern Europe in 1987, Hager said: ``Would
you, when your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, also feel obligated
to wallpaper your home?''
	   Hager, a journalist by training, joined the Communist Party in
1930 and fought in the Spanish civil war in the late 1930s. He was
born July 24, 1912, in the Swabian town of Bietigheim as the son of
a waiter.
	   Along with other top members of the Politburo, Hager was kicked
out of the party in October 1989 under pressure of East Germany's
peaceful revolution, which brought unification a year later.
	   He is survived by his wife, Sabina, and two children. Funeral
services were not announced.

Shell sees gloomiest oil market in five years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a
gloomy assessment of the oil business on Friday _ sending its
shares tumbling despite its plans to weather the weak market by
closing four big European offices.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart warned shareholders
that ``the results in the current and next quarter are expected to
reflect as difficult a trading environment as we have seen in the
last five years.''
	   Investors pushed Shell shares down by 5.6 percent in heavy
volume on the London Stock Exchange, while Royal Dutch stock fell
6.1 percent in Amsterdam.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell predicted depressed oil prices won't recover
any time soon, with the market glutted even as the ripple effects
of the Asian economic crisis are spreading into other regions.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil group said it is responding by cutting out
some bureaucratic fat.
	   It will close big offices that run its operations in Britain,
the Netherlands, France and Germany, leaving employees in smaller,
decentralized offices to deal directly with headquarters.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell will close its national head offices in
London, where 2,000 people work; Rotterdam, where 470 people work;
Hamburg, where 850 people work; and Frankfurt, where 900 people
work.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell could not say how many of the jobs will be
eliminated, although many of the people will be transferred to
other offices.
	   For example, Shell U.K. announced it will send 300 of the 2,000
people in the London office to Aberdeen, Scotland, where it runs
its North Sea oil operations.
	   ``There will be some job losses, but the number is unclear,''
said Shell spokesman Eric Nickson in London.
	   The big oil group is facing tough times in a market that has
seen crude oil prices plunge this year to levels unseen in a
decade.
	   The collapse started in the winter, when OPEC started pumping
more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis began
choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell chairman, Moody-Stuart, was to offer his
bleak assessment in a speech to be delivered later in the day to
fund managers in San Francisco. The company released highlights
ahead of time.
	   Moody-Stuart said that while the average price of Brent crude
oil over the past decade has been dlrs 18 per barrel, Royal
Dutch-Shell expects that over the next two to three years ``it
could stay depressed at levels between dlrs 12 and dlrs 16 per
barrel.''
	   Royal Dutch-Shell would probably have to write down the value of
some of its assets, even as it works to make its business more
efficient to weather the weak market conditions, the chairman said.

Polish tests of Israeli missiles in November at the latest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The first tests of Israeli NTD missiles
for the Huzar helicopter on a Polish testing range will be held no
later than November, a defense ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   Polish experts will watch the tests that will be held according
to a Polish scenario, Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk told the Associated
Press.
	   He said that the tests should begin by November.
	   After choosing the Israeli offer in October, Poles have been
pressing for tests of the prototype missile in Polish weather and
environment conditions. If tests are unsatisfactory, Poland can
withdraw from the deal.
	   Earlier this week, Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz received
a letter from his Israeli counterpart confirming that Israel wants
to go ahead with tests.
	   The government has earmarked 43 million zloty (dlrs 12 million)
for the Huzar project this year and the ministry set up two teams
to supervise the sensitive issue of equipping the combat
helicopter, Adamczyk said.
	   Following years of negotiating with several partners, Poland
signed an agreement in October that awarded the dlrs 800 million
contract to Israel's Rafael and Elbit companies to equip Huzar, in
line with NATO requirements. Poland rejected a similar offer from
U.S. giant Boeing.
	   The contract has aroused concern in the West about lack of
transparency of procurement procedures in Poland.
	   Under the deal, Rafael would supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD
missiles and Elbit would provide electronic integrating systems.
Both components of the deal still required approval from the two
governments.
	   But the Solidarity government, which took office shortly after
the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the tenders by
its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile tests. It also
decided to seek another tender for the integrating system.
	   A date has not been set for the tender, Adamczyk said.
	   Poland is scheduled to join NATO in April as one of three former
Warsaw Pact countries shifting to the Western military alliance,
but must modernize some of its army hardware and training.

Second-half penalty gives Fire 1-0 victory over Wizards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Czech defender Lubos Kubik converted a
59th-minute penalty kick to give the Chicago Fire a 1-0 victory
over Kansas City Thursday night, clinching a Major League Soccer
playoff berth for the Colorado Rapids and pushing the Wizards
closer to elimination.
	   Referee Noel Kenny whistled the penalty when defender Sean
Bowers hauled down Chicago's Polish midfielder Peter Nowak. It was
the second straight victory for the Fire since Nowak returned from
a knee injury.
	   Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton faced few serious chances from
Kansas City and recorded his league-leading eighth shutout.
	   Two of the eight playoff berths remain open with a week and a
half remaining in the regular season. Miami, Tampa and New England
still have hopes for the lone spot in the Eastern Conference while
Dallas and Kansas City will battle it out for the other.
	   The Wizards play the Burn on Sunday in Dallas, where a Burn
victory would end that race.

Miyamoto surges ahead in ANA Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITAHIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Katsumasa Miyamto shot a 5-under-par
67 in the wind and rain Friday and took a one-stroke lead over
Australian Stuart Appleby midway through the 100 million yen (dlrs
746,000) ANA Open.
	   Miyamoto sank six birdies against a bogey over the 7,063-yard
(6,427-meter), par-72 Sapporo Golf Club course for a 36-hole total
of 6-under 138.
	   ``I drove with irons on many holes today for more runs on the
wet fairway and accuracy,'' said Miyamoto, whose only title on the
tour came in the Tsuruya Open in April. ``I'm hitting it longer and
higher this season.''
	   Appleby, winner of the Kemper Open in June, shot a 70 and was
alone in second place at 139.
	   U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen and Hajime Meshiai fired 68s and
shared third at 140.
	   Another shot back at 141 were Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, Yasunori
Ida and Paraguay's Carlos Franco.
	   Masashi ''Jumbo'' Ozaki, a first-round co-leader, shot a 73 and
fell to a tie for eighth at 142.
	   A total of 66 survived the cut at 4-over 148.

Premier League considering pro referees and video replays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Corrects typo in headline

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Professional referees and video replays to
adjudicate on contentious goals are among initiatives proposed for
England's Premier League soccer competition next season.
	   Premier League referees' officer Philip Don on Friday said the
introduction of professional referees would help match officials
meet the expanding demands of players and fans.
	   Don said video replays would only be used in close goal
decisions, to verify whether or not the ball crosses the goal line.
	   ``The likes of fouls and infringements are down to the referee's
opinion,'' he said.
	   Rugby League and cricket already use video replays to support
officials in domestic competitions, while the technology is also
being used in other European soccer leagues.
	   Don said sponsorship would subsidize the wages for referees,
reportedly up to 50,000 pounds (dlrs 84,000) for top officials.
	   Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said the proposals could be
introduced by next season.
	   ``The thinking behind it all is to make sure there is continuous
improvement in refereeing standards,'' he said.

Ethnic Albanian leader backs US draft as basis for solution
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's top Albanian leader on
Friday endorsed a U.S.-backed plan that falls short of independence
demands but would end warfare in the Serbian province and restore
some autonomy to its Albanian majority.
	   Speaking to reporters in provincial capital, Pristina, the
leader, Ibrahim Rugova called the draft interim agreement a
``temporary solution,'' aimed at ``normalizing the difficult and
risky situation ... halting attacks and the use of force.''
	   Rugova said that the best solution for Kosovo remained
independence from Serbia, and associates demanded major changes to
the draft.
	   Still, his comments Friday represented his strongest endorsement
of the plan and gave a boost to international efforts to negotiate
an end to seven months of bloodshed. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic already signaled conditional acceptance of the draft when
its existence was first made public last month.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army _ ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting
for independence _ have rejected any negotiated settlement short of
that goal. But they have been marginalized after months of
battlefield losses to the better armed alliance of Serb police and
the Yugoslav army.
	   On Thursday, some details of the three-year plan were published
in the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore. It would give Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo, the say over local affairs but
keep them part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill discussed the plan with Rugova and
his associates in Pristina Thursday, said a Western diplomat
familiar with the talks.
	   One of them, Fehmi Agani, later told reporters the ethnic
Albanian side had ``serious complains about the proposal and it
would have to be changed.''
	   Kosovo's autonomy was revoked in 1989 by Yugoslav president
Slobodan Milosevic, two years before the start of wars which led to
the breakup of the country, leaving only Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro part of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova's endorsement came amid a growing humanitarian crisis in
the province, with a new Serb-Yugoslav offensive north of Pristina
increasing the flood of Albanian civilians abandoning destroyed
villages.
	   In Geneva Friday, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said the offensive, which started
Wednesday, has prompted about 10,000 people to flee at least 13
villages in the region between Podujevo and Mitrovica in the north,
Janowski said.
	   Attempts to enter the area have been blocked by Serb army and
police. But Janowski said UNHCR staff saw smoke rising from at
least one village, Bojcina, and all fleeing villagers told the same
story _ word that they would be attacked and shelling after they
fled.
	   The offensive appeared over Friday, with ethnic Albanian sources
saying that army and police units were pulling out of the region.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, Janowski said. Many were
reportedly sick or wounded.
	   More than 260,000 people _ most of them Albanian villagers _
have been made homeless by the fighting, including an estimated
50,000 refugees living in the mountains and forests. With
temperatures getting colder daily, the most exposed are at
increased risk of disease or death.
	   In Washington, the Pentagon was looking at air drops to stave
off the potential humanitarian disaster.
	   ``The short time to winter is putting pressure on everyone for a
solution,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift Sali Berisha's parliamentary immunity, paying the
way for the arrest of the former president on charges of organizing
an armed uprising during this week's riots.
	   The vote was 108 for stripping him of his immunity with none
opposing. Five ballots were declared invalid.

Taiwanese gangs kidnapping pigeons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese pigeon lovers have been
terrorized by gangs who abduct their precious birds, releasing them
only after their owners pay sizable ransoms.
	   Ransoms demanded can range up to 15,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 1,450), National Pigeon Association Director Tsai Tung-pao
told reporters Friday.
	   Total ransoms paid by owners over a year may reach up to 2
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 57 million), Tsai said.
	   Birds are typically captured with nets during races and their
owners contacted after identification through the numbered rings
the birds wear around their ankles.
	   If met with a refusal to pay, the birdnappers sometimes cut off
one of the bird's feet and mail it to the owner, Tsai said.
	   ``A good pigeon takes a lot of time and love to raise. It's
really a pity when they can't come home,'' Tai said.
	   The birdnappers extract ransoms through sophisticated bank and
credit card payment schemes, Tsai said, adding pigeon owners rarely
if ever notify police of the abductions, punishable under
racketeering laws.
	   Pigeon-raising and racing are popular in Taiwan, with specialist
magazines and even cable television stations devoted to the sport.
Specially bred champion birds can command prices in the thousands
of U.S. dlrs.

	   There was no indication when the prosecutors would try to arrest
the 53-year-old firebrand. International officials have been urging
the government to move slowly on arresting Berisha so as not to
inflame passions further in this troubled, former Communist
country.
	   The vote came after 3,000-4,000 Berisha supporters rallied
Friday in central Skanderbeg Square to hear their leader rail
against the ``dictatorship' of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano
and call for his resignation. There were no immediate reports of
similar demonstrations elsewhere.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that the tensions kindling violent riots early this week may be
fading.

Aviv,'' thousands of Hamas supporters on Friday exhorted the
group's bomb makers to attack Israelis in retaliation for the

 &UR; Ukrainian president in Moscow for talks with Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuchma's arrival in Moscow, graf 2, CHANGES
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had hoped for a
major summit with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in Ukraine, with
large delegations covering a wide range of issues.
	   Instead, Kuchma arrived in Moscow on Friday for a low-key
session with Yeltsin, to be held behind closed doors at a Russian
presidential residence outside Moscow. Upon arriving at a Moscow
airport, Kuchma boarded a helicopter to meet with Yeltsin.
	   The economic crisis in Russia is keeping Yeltsin occupied and
``does not provide for travels,'' Kuchma said Thursday. The summit
had originally been planned for the Ukrainian industrial town of
Kharkiv.
	   Instead of a range of mutual cooperation issues, the meeting is
to focus on Russia's economic crisis, its effects on neighboring
Ukraine and the formation of a new government in Moscow, Kuchma
said.
	   ``What road Russia takes in the future, what economic policies
the new government adopts in its program _ all that will
significantly influence the situation in Ukraine,'' he said.
	   The Russian crisis has put heavy pressure on Ukraine, a fellow
Slav nation of 50 million people. The hryvna currency went down
from 2.1 in mid-August to 2.94 Thursday as the government was
forced to expand its currency fluctuation band, and investors have
been leaving the shaky Ukrainian market.
	   Russia's financial downfall also is affecting Ukrainian exports.
Ukraine annually exports to Russia more than dlrs 10 billion worth
of commodities, or a third of its total exports, and these exports
were decreasing even before the crisis.
	   Kuchma, speaking in Kiev, said he would bring to Moscow a
far-reaching proposal for the creation of a free trade zone between
the two countries and other former Soviet republics instead of the
inefficient customs union set up by several ex-Soviet nations.
That, he said, would be ``the best way out'' of the crisis.
	   But Ukrainian media remained skeptical, pointing out that Russia
was not likely to open its market to the relatively cheap Ukrainian
goods.
	   Ukrainian officials say the sides still might discuss their
ambitious plan for economic cooperation signed in February. The
Russian side is likely to raise several painful questions, such as
that of Ukraine's debt for Russian natural gas and the issue of
Russian naval bases in Ukraine.

	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Chanting ``blow up Tel Aviv,''
thousands of Hamas supporters on Friday exhorted the group's
bombmakers to attack Israelis in retaliation for the killing of two
Hamas fugitives by Israel.
	   Israel resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip
two days before the Jewish New Year and amid warnings that Hamas
planned to kidnap Israeli soldiers and detonate bombs in Israeli
cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   The heightened tensions came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made a
final effort to salvage his latest peace mission and narrow the
gaps between Israel and the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
pullback.
	   Ross met with Arafat in Gaza City on Friday afternoon and was to
return to Washington on Saturday. It was not clear whether the
envoy would hold a final round of talks with Netanyahu.
	   The Hamas rally in El Bireh, the hometown of slain fugitives
Imad and Adel Awadallah, drew some 3,000 people after Muslim noon
prayers Friday. The Awadallah brothers, who had been involved in
plotting suicide bombings in Israel, were shot to death in an
Israeli army raid of their hideout near Hebron on Sept. 11.
	   Shaking their fists in anger, the marchers demanded that the
killings be avenged by the new chief bombmaker, known as Abu Hunud.
	   ``Abu Hunud, blow up, blow up Tel Aviv,'' the crowd chanted.
``Abu Hunud, oh hero, we want you to kidnap Israeli soldiers.''
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the Awadallah
brothers, and Israel army radio said there was concern that Hamas
would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force
Israel to release the bodies.
	   Israel's public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani, said he had
received ``specific warnings'' about Hamas plans to snatch
soldiers.
	   Israeli media warned of large-scale Hamas attacks in Israeli
cities. One Israeli newspaper wrote that Hamas planned to set off
car bombs in major Israeli cities. A headline in another paper
screamed, ``Hamas plans an attack like Kenya,'' referring to last
month's explosion on the American Embassy in Nairobi.
	   Also Friday, about 600 mourners joined the funeral procession of
17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, who was shot dead the day before,
apparently by a Jewish settler, in the West Bank village of
Beitunia.
	   Witnesses said Kabasma was killed and another teen-ager wounded
when they were fired on from a car with Israeli license plates.
	   The suspect, a 35-year-old resident of the Dolev settlement,
turned himself in on Thursday, several hours after the shooting.
	   On Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect held for
eight days. The suspect said his car was attacked by Palestinian
rock-throwers. He told police that he fired in the air and was not
aware that anyone was hit.
	   The Israeli army announced that it was reimposing a complete
closure of the West Bank and Gaza, starting at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT)
Friday. The restrictions, which bar all Palestinians from entering
Israel, will not be lifted before Wednesday, the first day after
the two-day New Year's holiday.
	   Israel had imposed a blanket closure after the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but gradually eased it, allowing 17,000 workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.

Asia crisis could hurt China plane orders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A drop-off in Asian tourism and poor domestic
airline profits could curb airplane orders, but deliveries from
major aircraft companies are still on track, industry officials
say.
	   Both Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie say they don't expect to
hold back on any plane deliveries to China this year, but they
forecast future orders will slow.
	   A Boeing spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires that deliveries to
China have been on schedule. Boeing expects all deliveries to be on
track next year as well, he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   He acknowledged the Chinese government has slowed its pace of
aircraft purchases to a halt for 1998.
	   Airbus still plans to deliver about 20 aircraft this year,
according to spokesman Jonathon Dong.
	   But those planes were ordered in 1996 and 1997 before the Asia
crisis began to take its toll on China's economy.
	   Since then, declining tourism, a slowdown in China's economic
growth and industry overcapacity have slashed profits of Chinese
airlines.
	   Some of those airlines have asked to postpone a few of their
deliveries, Dong said, without providing specifics.
	   However, Airbus is working with the airlines to prevent the
delays and is talking with the Chinese government on other deals,
he added.
	   ``Our market forecast is that there will be some difficulties,
but in the long-term China is still the largest market in the
region,'' Dong said.
	   Dong declined to comment on whether French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's visit to China next Thursday through Saturday would net
any deals for Airbus or whether it would help finalize negotiations
with Aviation Industries of China, or AVIC, to manufacture Airbus
jet components.
	   Earlier this month Airbus, Avic, Italy's Alenia SpA and
Singapore Technologies canceled plans to build a 100-seat regional
plane, saying that the project wasn't financially viable. But
Airbus said it's still seeking future projects with Avic.

Army announces sweep of northern mountains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The Seychelles army, which has
assumed police duties after recent armed attacks, is planning to
use heavy arms fire to dislodge assailants believed to be hiding in
the northern part of Mahe Island, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The opposition weekly Regar said the Seychelles People's Defense
Forces Thursday night warned people to stay away from the area
north of the capital, Victoria, over the weekend during the
manhunt.
	   The SPDF, which is believed to number about 300 men, arrested
about 30 people following attacks Aug. 28 and Sept. 9 in which a
national guardsman and a soldier were shot dead.
	   There have also been several armed robberies involving
semi-automatic weapons in the past few months on the normally
tranquil island that is the largest in a 92-island Indian Ocean
archipelago known mainly as a tourist destination.
	   In the Sept. 9 attack, two soldiers from the security guard of
President France-Albert Rene were ambushed and one was killed on a
mountain road after the army had carried out a search in the area
for several men being sought in connection with armed robberies.
One of them was killed by soldiers.
	   The newspaper said there were complaints of widespread
heavyhandedness by the army following the arrests. Soldiers
reportedly beat several youths and cut their long hair.
	   On Thursday, families of the seven people remaining in jail were
contacted and told they could visit their relatives and take them
food. The authorities had previously refused to confirm whether
they were holding the men.
	   Rene has been president since 1977 when he took power in a coup
a year after Seychelles obtained independence from Britain. There
were several aborted attempts by South African mercenaries to oust
Rene, who set up a socialist, one-party state.
	   In 1993 he agreed to and won multiparty elections and began
moves to liberalize the islands' economy.

	   The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
has been spearheading Western mediation, had been urging the
parliament to delay action on the immunity issue.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the OSCE representative here said before the vote.
	   Western diplomats have also endorsed appeals by the country's
largely ceremonial president, Rexhep Meidani, for calm. Meidani has
been working behind the scenes to find a way out of the crisis,
which exploded following the assassination Saturday of popular
opposition figure, Azem Hajdari.
	   Berisha himself has also urged restraint. But he has also
strongly denounced Nano, whom he blames for the killing, accusing
his rival of trying to ``direct the country toward civil
conflict.''
	   Berisha had urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries of the Cold War era. But most Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   Corruption is also rife under Nano's elected government. Still,
he is backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the unrest from
fueling other crises in the region, mainly the violence in
neighboring Kosovo province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy and restore confidence
in the nation's future.

conflict &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and the United States on Friday said they
would appeal to Ethiopia and Eritrea to halt for good a border
dispute that has killed several hundred people.
	   The announcement came a day after a U.S. delegation, led by
Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Susan Rice, met with
Italian officials at the foreign ministry.
	   Fighting broke out between the rival Horn of Africa countries in
mid-May and escalated to the brink of civil war in early June when
both sides bombed each other's territory. They also massed troops
along the contested portion of the border.
	   Several hundred people are believed to have died before the
fighting stopped in mid-June.
	   In a joint statement, Italy and the United States said they
would ask the countries ``not to resume military action, with the
hope that the Organization of African Unity initiative presently
underway (to which both Italy and the United States promise
continued active support) will lead to a lasting solution to the
conflict.''
	   The two sides have so far failed to reach a peace accord, but
they have pledged not to resume fighting before holding another
round of negotiations, mediated by OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years before gaining
independence in 1993.

Canadian, Seychelles boxers move to finals after dream fights
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Mark Simmons of Canada recovered
from two 8-counts in the first round and a 6-10 deficit in the
third to defeat Kevin Evans of Wales Friday in a heavyweight
semifinal at the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``I knew I was down but I didn't know by how much. I got a
lesson today, not to overlook people, take people too casually,''
said Simmons, a physical sciences student at the York University,
Toronto.
	   Simmons, 24, will fight the final against Roland Raforme of
Seychelles who also scored a dream victory over Garth Da Silva of
New Zealand in the second semifinal.
	   Da Silva led 11-4 going into the fifth round but an inspired
Raforme broke through his defenses with jabs and hooks on the face
to take the fight 15-13.
	   After the match, Da Silva hugged his trainer and wept for five
minutes. He said the game plan was to let his opponent come to him
instead of rushing into the fight. That caution cost him the bout.
	   He said he didn't realize that his opponent was gaining ground _
there was no way to tell because of the computer system of scoring
points, which are not revealed until the end.
	   In another closely watched fight, Brian Magee of Northern
Ireland lost to John Pearce of England 29-19 in the middleweight
category.
	   Magee, who had defeated defending champion Rowan Donaldson of
Jamaica on Thursday, was completely out of form Friday, giving away
a 4-0 lead to John in the first round, 9-1 in the second and 19-9
by the third.
	   John will now fight for the gold with India's Jitender Singh who
defeated Trevor Stewardson of Canada 21-10. Canada's Andrew Kooner
also lost the bantamweight match to Herman Ngoudjo of Cameroon.
	   Still, Simmons' recovery more than made up for Canada's
misfortunes.
	   He was down 1-6 in the first round after being knocked down by
Evans. Simmons recovered during an 8-count. But seconds later Evans
found a hook to his opponent's head and the referee stopped the
match for another 8-count.
	   Simmons finished the third round down 6-10, fourth 11-12 and won
the fight 19-11.
	   ``I knew Mark had the tools. He just had to get them out of the
tool box,'' said his manager, Gord Apolloni.
	   In a light flyweight bout, Sapok Biki raised hopes for host
Malaysia's first ever boxing gold after defeating Gary Jones of
England before a crowd of 1,000.
	   Jones was furious after losing the bout 15-11, complaining that
the judges had got it wrong.
	   ``I thought I won it and at the end of the day I've been robbed
of a gold medal,'' said Jones.
	   England coach Ian Irwin also felt Jones should have been marked
higher for his body punching and the referee did him no favors.
	   ``He was allowed to keep laying on and a good referee would
recognize that,'' said Irwin. ``I worry about the sport's future
with some of those officials.''
	   Sapok's final opponent, Moses Kinyua of Kenya, believes he can
end the home fighter's run.
	   ``You know why I am going to win? It's because I am stronger, I
am faster and I am better. I am very sure that I will beat him
(Sapok),'' said the 21-year-old big puncher who comes with a
40-point victory in the previous round and a 33-14 victory on
Friday over Roudik Kazanijian of Cyprus.
	   Still, Malaysia created history when four of its boxers
qualified for the quarterfinal round and two moved into the
semifinals.
	   Before this, no Malaysian boxer had ever moved past the
preliminary rounds.

Starbucks Coffee plans 500 stores in Asia by 2003
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Starbucks plans to open 500 stores in Asia by
2003 and will open its first stores in China next year, company
officials said Friday.
	   Howard Behar, head of international operations for Starbucks
Coffee Co., said the company plans to expand rapidly in Asia from
their 65 stores now, half of which are in Japan.
	   Starbucks on Friday signed a licensing agreement with Beijing
Mei Da Coffee Co. to open retail locations in Beijing.
	   Mei Da is a 50-50 joint venture between state-backed Beijing
General Corp. of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Borderless
Investment Corp., a Seattle-based venture capital company.
	   Lawrence Maltz, president of Borderless and a former executive
at Starbucks, said the first store is set to open in Beijing in
early 1999.
	   Although China is a nation of tea drinkers, Starbucks will offer
the same product line of espressos and other coffee drinks _ as
well as tea _ that it does elsewhere, said Maltz.
	   ``It would be foolish for us to wait until coffee was well
entrenched in China,'' Maltz said. ``We are prepared to take the
time and to make the investments necessary.''
	   Starbucks Coffee International, a subsidiary of Starbucks Coffee
Co., has opened retail locations in Japan, Singapore, the
Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

difficulties and widespread famine, North Korea declared Friday
that it will stick to its isolationist economic policy.
	   In an article in its official organ, the ruling Workers' Party
reaffirmed that juche, or self-reliance, will continue to be the
backbone of the communist country's economic policy.
	   ``It is a foolish daydream to try to revive the economy by
introducing foreign capital, not relying on one's own strength,''
said the article in Rodong Sinmun.
	   Rodong Sinmun described the article as the policy of Kim
Jong-il, who was installed as North Korea's supreme leader earlier
this month.
	   The article, also published by Kuroja, or the Laborer, a party
publication, warned that capitalistic economic reforms would only
cause catastrophic results as shown in former Soviet-bloc
countries.
	   ``We will ... set ourselves against all the attempts to induce
us to join an `integrated' world,'' the article said. ``We have
nothing to `reform' and `open.' ''
	   The article admitted that North Korea faces serious economic
difficulties but said that under Kim Jong Il, the country will
revitalize its economy ``one sector after another as ants gnaw a
piece of bone.''

Rome church group denies meddling in Algeria's affairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Harshly attacked by Algeria's foreign minister, a
Rome-based Catholic mediating group on Friday denied accusations
that it had interfered in Algerian internal affairs.
	   ``There has never been any intrusion,'' said Mario Marazziti, a
spokesman for the Community of Sant'Egidio. ``We just wish one day
this can be as clear in Algeria as it is in the rest of the
world,'' he added.
	   Marazziti said they have not made other efforts in Algeria since
1995, when Sant'Egidio arranged talks with Algerian guerrillas and
government officials to find a solution to the Algerian crisis, as
it has done successfully in Albania, Guatemala and Mozambique.
	   The talks, held in Rome, included Islamic hard-liners, although
members of the Armed Islamic Group, blamed for much of the
violence, were not included.
	   On a RAI state TV show Thursday, Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Attaf criticized the ``meddling of Sant'Egidio,'' but praised
Italy's initiatives to reach out to isolated regimes in the Islamic
world.
	   Algeria's Islamic regime has been widely accused of atrocities
in its fight against a 6-year-old Islamic insurgency. Algeria has
resisted foreign attempts to mediate in the conflict, which has
killed an estimated 75,000 people, mostly civilians.

Higo leads in Yukijirushi Ladies Tokai Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INABE, Japan (AP) _ Kaori Higo fired a 5-under-par 67 Friday for
a two-stroke lead in the opening round of the 60 million yen (dlrs
448,000) Yukijirushi Ladies Tokai Classic.
	   Higo, seeking her first win of the season and sixth overall,
overcame occasional rain and scored five birdies in a bogey-free
trek over the 6,351-yard (5,779-meter) Ryosen Golf Club course.
	   South Korean Ku Ok-hee, winner of the Chukyo TV Bridgestone
Ladies in May, and Akane Oshiro shot 69s.
	   Han Hee-won of South Korea, in her second tournament as a pro
after qualifying for the Japan tour in August, placed fourth at 70
along with Yuri Kawanami, Kotomi Akiyama and Huang Yueh-chyn of
Taiwan.
	   Michiko Hattori, winner of the Japan LPGA Championship last
week, shot a level-par 72.

Malaysian ousted minister calls on Mahathir to step down

<TEXT>
	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, fighting for his freedom and his political life, made a
stunning call Friday for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to step
down.
	   Just as startling, hundreds in the crowd listening to Anwar
Ibrahim responded with shouts of support, punching their fists in
the air, and chanting, ``God is great.''
	   Calls for a prime minister's resignation are extremely rare in
Malaysia.
	   Even opposition parties have not called for Mahathir to leave
office or suggested he be investigated for corruption, as Anwar did
this week in a series of increasingly scathing speeches.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's heir-apparent, made the call as he
escalates his challenge against the man who has ruled Malaysia for
17 years.
	   ``I call for the prime minister to step down,'' Anwar said,
shouting from a platform in front of a two-story house near the
beach.
	   When he yelled to the crowd of 5,000, asking them whether they
were behind his call, hundreds replied, ``We do.''
	   About 15 police officers, who had earlier barred Anwar from
speaking in front of a mosque, stood by but did nothing.
	   After grooming Anwar as his successor, the mercurial Mahathir
fired him Sept. 2 from the posts of deputy prime minister and
finance minister, then engineered Anwar's ouster from the ruling
party. Mahathir said that Anwar was morally unfit to hold office.
	   Five of Anwar's associates have been arrested as part of a
police investigation against Anwar on allegations of sexual
misconduct, abuse of power, interfering in a police probe and
leaking state secrets.
	   Anwar, who has denied the charges, says authorities are
embarrassed to detain him during the Commonwealth Games ending
Sept. 21 and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, which ends Sept. 23.
	   He told the crowd that on Sunday, the day the queen arrives, he
would speak in Merdeka Square in the center of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
	   How much longer the authorities will tolerate Anwar's challenge
is the top question on the streets.
	   Najib Tun Razak, vice president of the ruling United Malays
National organization, said Thursday that Anwar's nationwide
campaign, calling for reform, ``could create chaos and spark a
revolution, which would eventually lead to anarchy in the
country.''
	   Mahathir has responded almost mildly in public. In comments
published in Friday's papers, he challenged Anwar to prove his
innocence and criticized Anwar's attacks on the judiciary as a ploy
to claim unfair trial later.
	   ``Produce the evidence if there is evidence. We do not have a
problem with that,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Friday's Star
newspaper.
	   Police have said they would press charges against Anwar if he
speaks without a police permit. His increasingly personal
references to Mahathir in speeches over the past three days appear
to some observers to be almost daring arrest.
	   Friday's speech was the boldest yet.
	   ``I slogged day and night for him. I didn't challenge him,''
said Anwar.
	   ``I feared opposing him,'' he said. ``But now I'm battling
him.''
	   Anwar has accused Mahathir of firing him because Anwar was the
best political alternative to Mahathir.
	   Anwar called on police to be fair in their investigation of
himself, his family and his friends. But police must do the same
with Mahathir, his sons and his family, he said.
	   ``What has he done for the downtrodden?'' Anwar said of
Mahathir, mocking the prime minister's pride in building the
world's tallest building in the capital.
	   Anwar said police had allowed him to speak Friday without a
permit.
	   ``People say that Anwar is out and finished, but I say Anwar is
down but not out,'' he said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift Sali Berisha's parliamentary immunity, paying the
way for the arrest of the former president on charges of organizing
an armed uprising during this week's riots.
	   The vote was 108 for stripping him of his immunity with none
against. Five ballots were declared invalid.
	   There was no indication when the prosecutors would try to arrest
the 53-year-old firebrand. International officials have been urging
the government to move slowly on arresting Berisha so as not to
inflame passions further in this troubled, former Communist
country.
	   The vote came after 3,000-4,000 Berisha supporters rallied
Friday in central Skanderbeg Square to hear their leader rail
against the ``dictatorship' of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano
and call for his resignation. There were no immediate reports of
similar demonstrations elsewhere.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that the tensions kindling violent riots early this week may be
fading.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party holds 28 of the 150 parliamentary
seats but has rarely taken part in sessions since the June 1997
election which brought the Socialists to power. Nine other parties,
including the Socialists, are represented.
	   International officials have been trying to defuse tensions by
urging all sides, including the government, to move carefully to
avoid a showdown.

Oakes makes it six medals in six Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finals, will be updated with men's 400 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Flashing a new golden wave in her
hair, defending champion Judy Oakes gained a medal for the sixth
Commonwealth Games in a row Friday, winning her third gold.
	   The 40-year-old English athlete heaved 18.83 meters with her
first throw in the shot put to virtually put herself out of reach
of the other seven competitors. Second place Myrtle Augee made it
an English 1-2 but was 1.67 meters short of Oakes' effort. South
Africa's Johanna Abrahamse captured the bronze with a best of
16.52.
	   Friday's triumph makes it three golds, two silvers and a bronze
since she made her games debut at Edmonton in 1978. Oakes won a
bronze there, gold in Brisbane in '82, silver at Edinburgh in '86
and Auckland '90 and gold at Victoria, British Columbia four years
ago. She is the only track and field athlete to win a medal at six
games in a row.
	   Onichie Achike gained another gold for England with a games
record in the triple jump while Stuart Rendell captured Australia's
third hammer title in a row, and Andrea Blackett of Barbados also
set a games mark to win the women's 400 meters hurdles.
	   The highlight of Friday's program, the men's 400 meters, came
later.
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards not at the Games
because of a foot operation, Achike and Julian Golley were
England's big hopes in the triple jump.
	   Achike opened with a leap of 16.98 to take the lead and came up
with his record 17.10 in round four. His four other attempts were
no jumps. Andrew Owusu of Ghana collected silver with 17.03, Remmy
Limo gained the bronze with 16.89 and Golley, who was favored to
win in Edwards' absence, failed to medal in fourth with 16.83.
	   In the 400 hurdles, Blackett clocked 53.91 seconds, pulling away
from England's Gowry Retchakan-Hodge, who clocked 55.25 and Karlene
Houghton of Canada, who had 55.53. Her time beat the 54.51 run by
former Olympic champion Sally Gunnell at Victoria four years ago.
	   Rendell threw 74.71 meters to capture Australia's second hammer
gold following Debbie Sosimenko's victory in the women's event.
	   England's Michael Jones placed second with 74.02 and South
Africa's Chris Harmse took the bronze with a best heave of 72.83.
Rendell, who succeeds two-time winner Sean Carlin, had the best
three throws of the final.
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas, who triumphed in Thursday's 100
meter final, pulled out of the 200 heats Friday. Fastest qualifier
for Saturday's semifinal was Australia's Melinda Gainsford-Taylor,
returning to action after a knee injury.
	   The fastest qualifier for Saturday's women's 800 meters final
was from Mozambique and it wasn't former world champion Maria
Mutola.
	   Argentina Paulino clocked 2 minutes 00.11 seconds to win the
first semifinal and Mutola's time in the second after a slowly-run
race was 2:02.84. Mutola, the three-time world indoor titlist, was
followed home by Diane Modahl, the English runner who won the 1990
Games title and was prevented from defending it in '94 by a drugs
ban which was later quashed.
	   Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng, runner up at the Games
four years ago, cruised into the men's 800 final although Kenya's
Japhet Kimutai was fastest qualifier with 1:46.88.

Election official critical of premature Serb victory celebrations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from U.S. envoy. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - The chief international
election official warned Bosnian Serb radicals Friday against
celebrating their self-declared electoral victory, hinting they
could face punishment if demonstrations continue.
	   Any such victory would be a setback for U.S.-led efforts to
boost the popularity of moderates now in power in the Serb half of
Bosnia through reconstruction aid and other support.
	   Bracing for such a possibility, a U.S. envoy said Friday only
those who support the Dayton peace agreement meant to re-establish
peace and democracy would get American aid.
	   ``What we are interested in is, whoever is in power, that they
implement the Dayton agreement,'' he told reporters in Banja Luka,
the Serb city in northern Bosnia. ``If they do, we will support
them _ if they do not, they will get no support from the U.S.,
including economic support.''
	   Cheering backers of Nikola Poplasen have been celebrating in
Bosnian Serb towns, proclaiming that the leader of the Serb Radical
Party defeated the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in last
weekend's vote for president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Western officials admit Plavsic is trailing but have refused to
release any figures from the Saturday-Sunday balloting, citing a
complicated ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the need
for accuracy.
	   But a Poplasen victory would be a humiliating setback for U.S.
and European efforts to rebuild Bosnia-Herzegovina after the 3
1/2-year war which ended with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   A win by Poplasen, an ally of indicted war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic, would call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   ``We are in the process of suggesting to the (Serb) Radical
party and to Mr. Poplasen that it would not be in his interest to
have these demonstrations,'' said Robert Barry, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe office here.
	   Barry said that if protests continue, ``we will have to take
them into account in terms of our reaction.'' The OSCE, which
supervised the election, has the authority to disqualify candidates
of parties which violate campaign rules.
	   He refused to say whether OSCE was prepared to do that but
added, ``we cannot allow efforts to intimidate this process to go
on.''
	   Western officials admit that disqualifying Poplasen could
trigger a violent reaction among his followers and threaten the
entire Bosnian peace process. Bosnian Serbs have urged OSCE to
release results, although Barry's office said that could take
another five or six days.
	   In the Bosnian Serb city of Banja Luka, an official of
Poplasen's party, Pantelija Damjanovic, warned that if the OSCE
``comes up with an unjust decision,'' it would ``cause grave
problems and great evil... We shall await the decision, hoping it
will not be unjust.''
	   But a Plavsic ally, Milorad Dodik, urged the OSCE to disqualify
Poplasen for violating campaign rules by granting an interview to
Serb television after the deadline for such broadcasts.
	   Dodik, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic, said he
was willing to accept disqualification for his own breach of the
rules _ giving an interview to a local newspaper after the
deadline.
	   Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Bosnia's top international
mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said his office would ``respect the
will of the people.''
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists at the
election, despite international efforts to boost Plavsic and her
coalition by supplying millions of dollars of economic aid.
	   But much of that aid has not trickled down to rural Bosnian
Serbs. And radicalism among Bosnian Serbs may have been been
rekindled because of the clashes in the Serbian province of Kosovo
against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians and the resulting Western
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   During the election, Bosnians chose candidates for the
three-member joint national presidency, a national parliament and
regional and local posts. Those in the Serb-run area also voted for
their president.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift Sali Berisha's parliamentary immunity, paying the
way for the arrest of the former president on charges of organizing
an armed uprising during this week's riots.
	   The vote was 108 for stripping him of his immunity with none
against. Five ballots were declared invalid.
	   There was no indication when the prosecutors would try to arrest
the 53-year-old firebrand. International officials have been urging
the government to move slowly on arresting Berisha so as not to
inflame passions further in this troubled, former Communist
country.
	   The vote came after 3,000-4,000 Berisha supporters rallied
Friday in central Skanderbeg Square to hear their leader rail
against the ``dictatorship' of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano
and call for his resignation. There were no immediate reports of
similar demonstrations elsewhere.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that the tensions kindling violent riots early this week may be
fading.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party holds 28 of the 150 parliamentary
seats but has rarely taken part in sessions since the June 1997
election which brought the Socialists to power. Nine other parties,
including the Socialists, are represented.
	   International officials have been trying to defuse tensions by
urging all sides, including the government, to move carefully to
avoid a showdown.

Tanzania expells 14 foreigners questioned in embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has expelled 14
foreigners questioned in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy here.
	   Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said Thursday
that five Iraqis, five Sudanese, two Libyans, one Turk and another
person whose nationality was not given were handed over by police
to immigration authorities on Aug. 27 for expulsion.
	   ``Lack of direct evidence to connect them to the bomb atttack at
the U.S. Embassy in the city was a major reason for their
release,'' Chilambo said.
	   He did not say when the expulsions took place, but he did say
that two of the Sudanese remained in his department's custody
pending investigation to determine whether they will be declared
prohibited immigrants.
	   The Aug. 7 blast at the embassy in a residential neighborhood
killed 11 people. In neighboring Kenya, an almost simultaneous
explosion at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi killed 247 people, 12 of
them Americans.
	   Two men are in custody in the United States in connection with
the murder of the 12 Americans in Nairobi, and a third is being
sought.
	   In the northern city of Arusha Thursday, Adadi Rajabu, director
of the police Criminal Investigations Division who is also the head
of the task force looking into the bombing, said police are still
holding two principal suspects _ a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose
nationality he would not reveal.
	   Rajabu said three other people, including the owner of a metal
workshop where the explosive device reportedly was attached to a
vehicle, were in detention and helping police with the
investigation.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift Sali Berisha's parliamentary immunity, paying the
way for the arrest of the former president on charges of organizing
an armed uprising during this week's riots.
	   The vote was 108 for stripping him of his immunity with none
opposing. Five ballots were declared invalid.
	   There was no indication when prosecutors would try to arrest the
53-year-old firebrand. International officials have been urging the
government to move slowly on arresting Berisha to avoid inflaming
passions in the troubled formerly Communist country.
	   Corruption is also rife under the elected government of
Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano. Still, he is backed by Western
powers desperate to prevent the unrest from fueling other crises in
the region, mainly the violence in neighboring Kosovo province in
the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   The vote came after up to 4,000 Berisha supporters rallied
Friday in central Skanderbeg Square to hear their leader rail
against Nano's ``dictatorship'' of Nano and call for his
resignation.
	   Though Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
the tensions that kindled violent riots early this week may be
fading.
	   Ahead of the protest, international officials urged Albanians to
remain calm.
	   The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
has been spearheading Western mediation, had urged the parliament
to delay action on the immunity issue.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the OSCE representative here said before the vote.
	   Western diplomats have also endorsed appeals by the country's
largely ceremonial president, Rexhep Meidani, for calm. Meidani has
been working behind the scenes to find a way out of the crisis,
which exploded following the assassination Saturday of popular
opposition figure, Azem Hajdari.
	   Berisha himself has also urged restraint. But he has also
strongly denounced Nano, whom he blames for the killing, accusing
his rival of trying to ``direct the country toward civil
conflict.''
	   Berisha had urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries during the Cold War. But most Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy and restore confidence
in the nation's future.

Australia win two of three cycling golds

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with time trial race &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion Shane Kelly and
Brad McGee gave Australia two of the three gold medals in Friday's
cycling races at the Commonwealth Games, and both broke their own
Games records.
	   Kelly won the 1,000-meter time trial and McGee the men's
4,000-meter pursuit.
	   Despite a scare from British record holder Jason Queally, Kelly
came out .4 second ahead thanks to a fast first lap. But his time
of one minute, 4.018 seconds was well below his best time of
1:00.613, set in Colombia in 1995. He had set the old Games record
of 1:05.386 four years ago in Victoria, Canada.
	   Queally took the silver in 1:04.427 and Australian Joshua
Kersten won the bronze in 1:04.618 in the 26-rider field.
	   McGee won the individual cycling pursuit in 4:30.594 seconds,
improving on his record of 4:31.371 from the 1994 games.
	   ``The race went much to plan, which is the best way to go,''
McGee said. But he also said that his timing might have been better
but for the slight bumps and the roughness of the track.
	   Compatriot Luke Roberts ended with the silver after losing the
first-place race to McGee. England's Matt Illingworth won the
bronze by outracing compatriot Brad Wiggins.
	   Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand beat games record holder Alayna Burns
of Australia by 1.3 seconds for the gold in the 3,000-meter women's
individual pursuit.
	   Ulmer finished in 3:41.667 in the afternoon heat and humidity,
slower than the record of 3:40.389 that Burns had set Thursday.
	   ``I went out there and tried by best,'' said Burns. ``I have
only myself to blame.''
	   But the 18-year-old Commonwealth Games newcomer said she was not
disappointed with the silver and was optimistic about future
victories.
	   England's Yvonne McGregor won the bronze unopposed after her
opponent in the third-place duel, world champion Lucy
Tyler-Sharman, was expelled from the Australian team earlier Friday
for criticizing team management.
	   Tyler-Sharman broke a team agreement not to criticize other
members of the group.
	   The 33-year-old Australian, who won the world title in that
event at Bordeaux, France, last month, lost her chance for gold
here when she lost a semifinal Thursday night.
	   After that race, she attacked team management, including coach
Charlie Walsh, in an interview and was dragged away from the
cameras by cycling team manager Michael Flynn.
	   Tyler-Sharman also implied her pedals had been sabotaged, a
claim hotly denied by team support staff.
	   ``Yesterday, Lucy made a public statement criticizing cycling
section management and coaching staff, which is a clear violation
of the team agreement signed by all athletes prior to them joining
the team,'' said Don Stockins, head of the Australian delegation.

Hundreds of thousands hold funeral for slain Iranian diplomats

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Iranians joined a
funeral procession Friday for diplomats killed by fighters of the
Taliban militia, part of seething demonstrations against the
religious army that controls most of neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Chanting ``death to the Taliban'' and ``death to America,'' the
protesters carried six coffins, cloaked in Iran's red, white and
green flag, to Tehran University, where prayers were held.
	   The coffins were then taken to the sprawling cemetery of
Behesht-e-Zahra in south Tehran and buried near the tomb of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.
	   Demonstrations against the Taliban were also held in the cities
of Mashhad, Arak, and Tabriz, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency said.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
admitted Sept. 10 to killing eight diplomats and a journalist for
the news agency after its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran on
Monday. However, Iranian radio reported Friday that the Foreign
Ministry could not identify the body of one diplomat and asked the
International Committee of the Red Cross to try to help.
	   The killings brought to a head simmering tension between Iran
and the Taliban. Iran has since massed tens of thousands of troops
on its border with Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has put the military on full alert.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the border region
to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   At Tehran University, Zabihullah Bakhshi, a member of the
militant Ansar-e Hezbollah group, said the deaths would be avenged.
	   ``We will not let your blood go to waste,'' he shouted, dressed
in camouflage and carrying a rifle.
	   The demonstrators urged Pakistan to end its support for the
Taliban. Pakistan is widely believed to provide military and other
support to the religious army. Iran is suspected of backing the
opposition, which largely represents the country's minority ethnic
and religious groups, including minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Iran has also accused Pakistani intelligence forces of helping
the Taliban storm the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif last
month and capturing the diplomats.
	   Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack.

	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A spokesman for Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki pleaded guilty to culpable homicide,
negligent driving and having consumed alcohol over the legal limit
in connection with a fatal car crash last year, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Sentencing for Thami Ntenteni, 44, was scheduled for Nov. 5, the
Sowetan newspaper reported. He had entered the plea on Thursday.
	   His conviction followed an accident on the N1 Highway near
Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on December 22 last year, in which
one person was killed and four others injured.
	   Ntenteni has been suspended as Mbeki's spokesman.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A judge suspended a ban on four Muslim aid
agencies, causing Muslims in Kenya to call off a countrywide
prayer-protest on Friday.
	   Justice Joyce Alouch said she granted the suspension Thursday so
representatives could challenge the ban and the cancellation of
work permits for four officials heading the agencies, the East
African Standard said. However, bans on two other Muslim aid
agencies weren't suspended.
	   Last week, a month after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi that killed 247 people, the government banned 16
nongovernmental organizations, including six Muslim aid agencies.
	   The government imposed the ban after investigators reportedly
discovered that the explosives used to make the bomb entered Kenya
in relief food shipments handled by a Muslim aid agency.
	   The four agencies that were granted suspension of the ban are
the International Islamic Relief Organization, the Muslim World
League, Al-Haramain and Mercy Relief International.
	   Three of the agencies are funded by Saudi Arabia.
	   The relief agencies have been running health centers, schools
and orphanages for Muslims and non-Muslims, mainly in northeastern
Kenya.
	   --
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal is sending 137 tons of aid,
including food and medicine, to its former colony Guinea-Bissau
where some 300,000 people have been displaced by a three-month
conflict.
	   The aid is scheduled to leave Lisbon by ship Sept. 22 on a
week-long voyage to the tiny West African country, according to
news reports Friday.
	   Efforts to help the displaced population have been stymied by
the failure to broker a peace deal between a breakaway military
faction and President Joao Bernardo Vieira who is supported by
troops from neighboring Senegal.
	   The two sides agreed to a cease-fire July 26, but ongoing talks
mediated by the Economic Community of West African States and the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries have failed to cement a
permanent peace accord.
	   Aid groups have warned of a possible humanitarian crisis if the
refugees did not receive food and medicine.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The World Bank says it will increase its
investments in development projects for Nigeria _ Africa's most
populous nation.
	   World Bank Vice President Jean-Louis Sarbib made the pledge in
Lagos on Thursday, on the last leg of an official visit to Nigeria.
	   ``The World Bank is ready to co-operate with Nigeria in its
aspiration to
	   achieve political stability and economic growth,'' Sarbib was
quoted Friday as saying by the News Agency of Nigeria.
	   Earlier during his visit, Sarbib praised head of state Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar who took over after the June death of dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Since coming to power, Abubakar has freed many political
detainees and pledged a return to civilian rule next year.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Mobile phones, a trademark for the
Ivory Coast's commercial elite, are also increasingly popular with
thieves, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Over 200 cellular telephones are stolen each week in Abidjan,
the Ivory Coast's primary city, Fraternite Matin newspaper
reported.
	   Phones are most often snatched from users at traffic lights, or
from people in their cars during the capital's morning traffic
jams, the report said.

Hundreds of Hamas supporters stone Israeli soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hundreds of Hamas supporters stoning Israeli
soldiers near Jewish settlement &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Venting their anger over Israel's
killing of two Hamas fugitives, hundreds of the group's supporters
on Friday stoned Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement and
exhorted Hamas bombmakers to ``blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Israeli troops deployed outside the Psagot settlement fired
rubber bullets to disperse some 500 stone throwers who yelled
``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, as they twirled slingshots.
	   Five Palestinians were injured lightly.
	   Palestinian riot police formed a human chain to try and prevent
more people from reaching the scene. The stone throwers had broken
away from a Hamas rally held in nearby El Bireh to protest Israel's
Sept. 11 killing of Imad and Adel Awadallah, two Hamas fugitives.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip two days before the Jewish New Year. Israeli
intelligence officials said they had warnings that Hamas planned to
kidnap Israeli soldiers and detonate bombs in Israeli cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   The heightened tensions came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made a
final effort to salvage his latest peace mission and narrow the
gaps between Israel and the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
pullback.
	   Ross met with Arafat in Gaza City on Friday afternoon and was to
return to Washington on Saturday. It was not clear whether the
envoy would hold a final round of talks with Netanyahu.
	   The Hamas rally in El Bireh, the hometown of Awadallah brothers,
drew some 3,000 people after Muslim noon prayers Friday. The
Awadallahs, who had been involved in plotting suicide bombings in
Israel, were shot to death in an Israeli army raid of their hideout
near Hebron.
	   Shaking their fists in anger, the marchers demanded that the
killings be avenged by the new chief bombmaker, known as Abu Hunud.
	   ``Abu Hunud, blow up, blow up Tel Aviv,'' the crowd chanted.
``Abu Hunud, oh hero, we want you to kidnap Israeli soldiers.''
	   After the rally, several hundred Hamas supporters marched toward
the nearby settlement of Psagot where they hurled stones at two
Israeli army jeeps blocking the access road.
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the Awadallah
brothers, and Israel army radio said there was concern that Hamas
would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force
Israel to release the bodies.
	   The warnings of large-scale Hamas dominated Israeli media
Friday. One newspaper wrote that Hamas planned to set off car bombs
in major Israeli cities. A headline in another paper said, ``Hamas
plans an attack like Kenya,'' referring to last month's explosion
on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   Also Friday, about 600 mourners joined the funeral procession of
17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, who was shot dead the day before,
apparently by a Jewish settler, in the West Bank village of
Beitunia.
	   Witnesses said Kabasma was killed and another teen-ager wounded
when they were fired on from a car with Israeli license plates.
	   The suspect, a 35-year-old resident of the Dolev settlement,
turned himself in on Thursday, several hours after the shooting.
	   On Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect held for
eight days. The suspect said his car was attacked by Palestinian
rock-throwers. He told police that he fired in the air and was not
aware that anyone was hit.
	   The Israeli army announced that it was reimposing a complete
closure of the West Bank and Gaza, starting at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT)
Friday. The restrictions, which bar all Palestinians from entering
Israel, will not be lifted before Wednesday, the first day after
the two-day New Year's holiday.
	   Israel had imposed a blanket closure after the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but gradually eased it, allowing 17,000 workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.

Landslide keeps Corinth Canal shut until next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A landslide will keep the Corinth Canal,
an important time-saving Mediterranean shipping route, closed until
early next week, the canal's traffic control authorities said
Friday.
	   A landslide on Thursday sent rocks and earth crashing about 87
meters (285 feet) down into the canal, which stretches 6.5
kilometers (3.9 miles) to connect the Aegean Sea to the Ionian Sea.
	   Crews working to clear the rocks from the 25-meter (82 foot)
wide canal have little room to maneuver and will take at least four
days to complete the work, authorities said.
	   The canal, about 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Athens, was
opened in 1893 and shortens the distance from Greece's main port of
Piraeus to Brindisi, Italy, by approximately 320 kilometers (192
miles).

Tanzania expells 14 foreigners questioned in embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has expelled 14
foreigners questioned in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy here.
	   Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said Thursday
that five Iraqis, five Sudanese, two Libyans, one Turk and another
person whose nationality was not given were handed over by police
to immigration authorities on Aug. 27 for expulsion.
	   ``Lack of direct evidence to connect them to the bomb atttack at
the U.S. Embassy in the city was a major reason for their
release,'' Chilambo said.
	   He said the five Iraqis were sent to Iraq on Sept. 9 and 10, and
and three Sudanese, two Libyans, a Turk and the person of
unidentified nationality were expelled Sept. 12.
	   He said two Sudanese remained in his department's custody
pending investigation to determine whether they will be declared
prohibited immigrants.
	   The Aug. 7 blast at the embassy in a residential neighborhood
killed 11 people. In neighboring Kenya, an almost simultaneous
explosion at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi killed 247 people, 12 of
them Americans.
	   Two men are in custody in the United States in connection with
the murder of the 12 Americans in Nairobi, and a third is being
sought.
	   In the northern city of Arusha Thursday, Adadi Rajabu, director
of the police Criminal Investigations Division who is also the head
of the task force looking into the bombing, said police are still
holding two principal suspects _ a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose
nationality he would not reveal.
	   Rajabu said three other people, including the owner of a metal
workshop where the explosive device reportedly was attached to a
vehicle, were in detention and helping police with the
investigation.

Ethnic Albanian leader backs U.S. draft as basis for solution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's top Albanian leader on
Friday endorsed a U.S.-backed plan to end warfare in the Serbian
province that falls short of rebel demands for independence but
restore some autonomy to the ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Speaking to reporters in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Ibrahim
Rugova called the draft interim agreement a ``temporary solution,''
aimed at ``normalizing the difficult and risky situation ...
halting attacks and the use of force.''
	   Rugova said the best solution for Kosovo remained independence
from Serbia, and his associates demanded major changes to the
draft.
	   Still, his comments Friday represented his strongest endorsement
of the plan and gave a boost to international efforts to negotiate
an end to seven months of bloodshed. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic already signaled conditional acceptance of the draft when
its existence was first made public last month.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, made up of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, have rejected any negotiated settlement short of
independence. But they have been marginalized after months of
battlefield losses to the better-armed alliance of Serb police and
the Serb-led Yugoslav army.
	   On Thursday, some details of the three-year plan were published
in the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore. It would give Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo, control over local affairs but
keep them part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill discussed the plan with Rugova and
his associates in Pristina on Thursday, said a Western diplomat
familiar with the talks.
	   One of Rugova's colleagues, Fehmi Agani, told reporters the
ethnic Albanian side had ``serious complaints about the proposal
and it would have to be changed.''
	   Kosovo's autonomy was revoked in 1989 by Milosevic, two years
before the start of wars that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia,
which now consists only of Serbia and much smaller Montenegro.
	   Rugova's endorsement came amid a growing humanitarian crisis in
Kosovo.
	   In Geneva on Friday, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said the latest Serb-Yugoslav offensive,
which started Wednesday, has prompted about 10,000 ethnic Albanians
to flee at least 13 villages between Podujevo and Mitrovica in the
north, Janowski said.
	   Attempts to enter the area have been blocked by Serb army and
police.
	   Janowski said UNHCR staff saw smoke rising from at least one
village, Bojcina, and all fleeing villagers told the same story _
word that they would be attacked and shelling after they fled.
	   The offensive appeared over Friday, with ethnic Albanian sources
saying that army and police units were pulling out of the region.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 people displaced
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, Janowski said. Many were
reportedly sick or wounded.
	   More than 260,000 people _ most of them Albanian villagers _
have been made homeless by the fighting, including an estimated
50,000 refugees living in the mountains and forests. With
temperatures getting colder daily, the most exposed are at
increased risk of disease or death.
	   In Washington, the Pentagon was looking at air drops to stave
off the potential humanitarian disaster.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former international soccer stars from
France and Germany meet Sunday in a benefit game for a French
policeman beaten unconscious by German hooligans during the World
Cup.
	   The game at Kehl am Rhein, in southern Germany, is being
sponsored by the French and German soccer federations under the
motto ``Yes to Soccer Without Violence.''
	   Officials expect it to draw at least 6,000 fans and raise
100,000 marks (dlrs 60,000) for the family of 44-year-old policeman
Daniel Nivel, German federation spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said.
	   Thus far more than 1 million marks (dlrs 595,200) have been
collected for Nivel, who earlier this month was reported making
steady progress after recovering from a coma in early August.
	   Five German soccer fans remain in custody _ one in France and
four in Germany _ on charges of attacking Nivel on June 21 shortly
after a match between Germany and Yugoslavia in Lens.
	   Nivel, who was guarding a vehicle near the stadium at the time
of the attack, was hit on the head with an iron bar.
	   The suspects face charges of attempted murder, causing serious
bodily harm, and disturbing the peace.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A right-wing One Nation party official
resigned Friday after it was reported she was running a candidate's
election campaign from premises used by a bondage mistress.
	   Linda Farrell said she was not ``Mistress Amber,'' who has
advertised in Sydney newspapers offering clients fantasy
exploration, bondage and discipline and other erotic activities.
	   She said she was the victim of a scurrilous campaign to
discredit One Nation, the new right-wing populist party founded by
anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal independent member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson.
	   The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the business and
mobile phone numbers for ``Mistress Amber'' were the same as for
Farrell, the campaign manager for Ian Hale, One Nation's candidate
for the western Sydney seat of Parramatta.
	   Hale was shocked by the report after stating that his campaign
was being run out of Farrell's home.
	   Farrell said the ``Mistress Amber'' service was being run out of
another house on her North Parramatta property.
	   She conceded it was ``probably naive and foolish'' not to have
told Hale, but claimed she had been the victim of a vindictive
campaign.
	   ``We have done nothing wrong; we have not committed a crime.
It's just to denigrate and destroy One Nation,'' she said.
	   She said she resigned to distance any further reports about her
links with ``Mistress Amber'' from Hale's candidacy.

Compromise candidate chosen as new Thai army chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's prime minister named Gen.
Surayuth Chulanon the new army commander in chief on Friday as a
compromise choice agreeable to both the military and democracy
activists.
	   Amid heavy lobbying by various factions in the military, Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai chose Surayuth, 55, the chief adviser to the
army, the military's most powerful post.
	   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a constitutional monarch, approved the
selection, as is required for all high-ranking appointments by the
government and military.
	   The candidate opposed by democracy activists, Gen. Chainarong
Noonpakdi, was named deputy supreme commander. With only a year
left before he retires, this will be his last position in the
military.
	   Chainarong commanded soldiers that opened fire on democracy
protesters in the streets of Bangkok in May 1992, killing at least
40 and wounding more than a hundred.
	   Democracy activists appealed to Chuan to reject Chainarong's
nomination and warned there could be street demonstrations if the
controversial general was approved.
	   His candidacy had the support, however, of several top generals,
including Supreme Commander Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit, who warned
Chuan not to interfere in the reshuffle.
	   Despite the ostentatious title, the Supreme Command is mainly an
administrative department. Its generals do not directly control any
troops.
	   Chuan is the first civilian defense minister in 22 years. The
military has staged more than a dozen successful coup d'etats since
the end of World War II.
	   Nonetheless, Chuan has shown no reluctance to attempt to rein in
the military and professionalize it, insisting that as defense
minister it was his job to change the promotion list if it was
unsuitable.
	   Several generals expressed worries that Chuan would choose a new
commander who would not have the support of the military
establishment.
	   Surayuth is a former commander of the Second Army who was
decorated for bravery while fighting communist insurgents.
	   The Nation newspaper reported that he spent a good part of his
career dealing with border problems and shunned publicity while
focusing on ``behind-the-scenes operations.''
	   He was also a close aide to former Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulananda, a respected statesman, who served from 1980-88.
	   Surayuth is not slated to retire until 2003, and so will have
several years to leave his mark on the army.
	   ``The army must be restructured to be smaller, more efficient
and free of politics,'' he told ITV, and independent television
station. ``We have too many generals. We are top heavy.''
	   ITV also reported that diplomats from neighboring countries said
Surayuth was the best choice among the candidates.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift a former president's parliamentary immunity,
clearing the way for the arrest of Sali Berisha on charges of
organizing an armed uprising.
	   The vote _ prompted by this week's rioting in the poor Balkan
country _ was 108 for stripping Berisha of his immunity with none
against. Five ballots were declared invalid.
	   There was no indication when prosecutors would try to arrest the
53-year-old Berisha. International officials have been urging the
government to move slowly on arresting him so as not to incite more
unrest.
	   The vote came after up to 4,000 Berisha supporters rallied
Friday in central Skanderbeg Square to hear their leader rail
against the ``dictatorship'' of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos
Nano, who took office last year, and call for his resignation.
	   The crisis began with the killing Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha who immediately blamed Nano.
The killing sparked rioting Sunday and Monday in the capital,
Tirana, that left three people dead and scores injured.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of months of anarchy
last year following the collapse of pyramid schemes, which cost
many people their life's savings. Berisha was president during the
crisis and lost elections in its aftermath.
	   Western powers are worried the unrest could fuel other crises in
the region, mainly the violence in neighboring Kosovo province in
the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Although Berisha supporters have protested for three straight
days, they have failed to gather in significant numbers, indicating
that the tensions kindling the riots early this week may be fading.
	   Ahead of the protest, international officials urged Albanians to
remain reasonable.
	   The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
has been spearheading Western mediation, had been urging the
parliament to delay action on the immunity issue.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the OSCE representative in Tirana said before the vote.
	   Berisha himself has also urged restraint. But he has also
strongly denounced Nano, accusing his rival of trying to ``direct
the country toward civil conflict.''
	   Berisha had urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country today against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries of the Cold War era. But most Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party holds 28 of the 150 parliamentary
seats but has rarely taken part in sessions since the June 1997
election which brought the Socialists to power. Nine other parties,
including the Socialists, are represented.

Ex-head of German power station jailed for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A former director of a German power
company who defrauded his employer of 7.5 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.5 million) was jailed for seven years Friday.
	   The betrayal of trust placed in Gert Juergen Gratz, 49, had
caused ``anxiety and stress'' to employees, who were too frightened
to question his irregular transactions as a senior executive, the
judge said.
	   Gratz was commercial director of the Melbourne arm of a company
building power stations, the Frankfurt-based Lurgi AG, and managing
director of a subsidiary, Lucon.
	   Supreme Court Justice John Coldrey said Gratz had set out to
create a lavish lifestyle for himself over 3 1/2 years.
	   By the time he was unmasked in April 1995, Gratz, a German
national, had acquired eight Victorian state properties, including
two farms.
	   Gratz pleaded guilty to charges of theft, false accounting and
making a false document.
	   The judge ordered him to serve a minimum non-parole term of four
years.
	   He held executive responsibility for contracts with clients and
suppliers and for financial administration of both Lurgi and Lucon.
	   The judge said Gratz reported to the boards of Lurgi and Lucon
and to the German parent company on the financial position of both
the Australian organizations.
	   The defrauding involved ``repeated deliberate acts of
dishonesty, including the creation of false invoices, false
purchase orders and the by-passing of accounting procedures,'' the
judge said.
	   Gratz also set up private companies to receive the stolen money.
	   The man he replaced as Lucon's managing director, Herbert
Dietrich, had helped him steal the money, the court heard.
	   However, Dietrich had fled to Germany and could not be
extradited because he is a German national.

EU reviews aid to Congo belligerents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union said Friday it was
reviewing its aid programs to African nations involved in the
fighting in Congo to ensure EU money was not helping finance the
war.
	   The EU's top African affairs official, Commissioner Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, said the withdrawal of all foreign troops was essential
for the success of talks to resolve the civil war.
	   Pinheiro said the EU's executive Commission ``must review the
use of funds that we mobilize for development, to ensure (EU)
community resources are not used to indirectly finance the war.''
	   EU officials said the review would apply to Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia which have sent troops to support the Congolese government,
and to Uganda, Rwanda and perhaps Burundi which are suspected of
aiding rebels in the former Zaire.
	   Pinheiro warned the fighting in Congo risked dragging in still
more nations.
	   ``This armed conflict ... with so many countries involved and
the risk of destabilization it provokes is without precedent in
Africa,'' Pinheiro said in a speech distributed at EU headquarters
in Brussels.
	   In 1995, the EU began five-year development aid programs worth
between dlrs 100 million and dlrs 180 million with the six
countries concerned.

Fiji calls for drought aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji's Foreign Ministry has been asked to seek
aid from abroad to help with emergency relief supplies for drought
victims, Finance Minister James Ah Koy said Friday.
	   The government has already distributed relief food supplies to
drought victims in the sugar belt. It has also shared out 8 million
Fiji dollars (U.S. dlrs 4 million) to the cane farmers.
	   But that is not enough. At least 10 million Fiji dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5 million) more is needed to cater for the increasing number
of people now facing severe hardship because of the drought, the
government's regional development assistant secretary, Jone
Bolaitamana, said this week.
	   The latest survey figures show 55,000 households needed
emergency aid. An earlier survey had put the figure at 30,000.
	   Surveys show a rapid rise in cases of hardship in Fiji's north,
where the number of households needing help has risen from 367 to
4,570.
	   Ah Koy said the drought was more severe than expected. Although
government funds were scarce, he said it would find the money to
deal with the drought situation.
	   ``I've got only two options -- either to draw money from the
operational budget or from capital projects,'' he said.
	   He was reluctant to draw money from the capital projects fund
because that would delay development programs.
	   `I've advised the Foreign Affairs Ministry to ask for overseas
aid,'' he said.

Canadians win two shooting golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trap shooting, protest over Igorov medal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadians won two gold medals
Friday in shooting events at the Commonwealth Games, including the
difficult full-bore rifle competition at distances of 300 to 1,000
yards.
	   Jim Paton won the full-bore event and Metodi Igorov took gold in
the men's rapid fire pistol competition on Langkawi Island.
Igorov's gold, however, was put on hold because of a South African
protest calling for proof of the Bulgarian native's Canadian
nationality.
	   New Zealand's Stephen Petterson, who won two golds in small-bore
rifle shooting in the 1994 games, scored highest in the men's free
rifle prone event.
	   Australian Michael Diamond won the gold in trap shooting in a
shootout with England's Ian R. Peel after both broke 144 targets.
In the shootout, both missed their fourth shots, and Diamond
triumphed when Peel missed his eighth. New Zealand's Desmond Coe
won a bronze medal shootout with England's Robert Borsley, 3-2,
after both hit 141 targets.
	   Malaysia's Nurul Baharin won the women's air rifle shooting.
	   Paton, a 41-year-old liquor store manager, built his lead at the
shorter distances of 300, 500 and 600 yards, and then matched the
best scores at 900 and 1,000 yards, scoring 402 points. He had won
the separate Commonwealth shooting championships last November with
402.53.
	   Malaysia's Zainal Md Zain and England's Andy Luckman both shot
400, but Zainal won the silver on countback. Zainal said wind
affected the long-distance shooting.
	   Igorov won the rapid fire pistol with 580 points, six ahead of
silver medalist Allan McDonald of South Africa and seven ahead of
bronze medalist Bhanwar Dhaka of India.
	   Petterson beat David Moore of the Isle of Man 697.4 to 696.6 for
the gold in free rifle shooting. South African Gavin van Rhyn took
the bronze with 694.1.
	   In the women's air rifle shooting, Baharin won with 494.8,
followed by Canada's Sharon Bowes with 493.3 and England's Louise
Minett with 491.7.

At entertainment launching Polish digital TV
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The U.S.-based At Entertainment Inc. on
Friday inaugurated Poland's first digital television service
available via satellite and through cable network.
	   Called Wizja TV, the service is beamed into Poland from Britain,
but the company plans to apply for a Polish license and begin
broadcasting from Poland, its president, Przemyslaw Szmyt, told a
news conference.
	   The pay-TV service becomes available to 30,000 households which
already installed digital satellite receivers supplied by Wizja and
to some 876,000 homes hooked up to Polska Telewizja Kablowa, At
Entertainment's cable network, but Szmyt said he expected a quick
expansion of the number of viewers.
	   The service targets Poland's growing middle class and the annual
fee will be an equivalent of dlrs 90, Szmyt said.
	   In October, Wizja will face digital competition from Canal Plus
Polska, a subsidiary of France's Canal Plus SA, which has been
negotiating a joint project with Polish state television, leading
private television Polsat and several cable operators.
	   The two main rivals, Wizja and Canal Plus, had planned a merger
earlier this year, but Wizja pulled out of the talks because ``we
differed over various issues'' Szmyt said. He refused further
details.
	   Wizja offers up to 20 Polish-language channels, including CNN
International, HBO or Discovery. It's flag Wizja 1 channel features
Polish national soccer team matches, films and talk shows.
	   Wizja also provides some 40 other international digital channels
which are carried over by the Astra satellite.
	   The company also hopes to broadcast three Polish state
television channels free of charge, but Szmyt said the Polish
television board has failed to respond to their offer.
	   Observers point out that the service, which will be able to
offer Polish state television programs, will eventually win a major
share of the market.
	   Szmyt rejected his competitors suggestions that there is not
enough room for two paid digital TV operators in Poland, saying
competition in a free market is needed.
	   Poland, with a lot of TV-addicts among its 40 million people, is
one of Europe's fastest growing television markets.

Kohl closing gap in re-election bid, poll finds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl is closing the gap
in his battle for re-election, less than two weeks before Germans
cast their votes, a poll said Friday.
	   The race between Kohl and Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, who
took the lead after his nomination last spring, now is too close to
call, according to the poll for ZDF public television.
	   The Social Democrats polled 39.5 percent of the vote for the
Sept. 27 election, down 1.5 percent from a week earlier. Kohl's
Christian Democrats came in at 37.5 percent, up 0.5 percent. The
gap was so small it fell within the margin of error, the pollsters
said.
	   Kohl, in power for 16 years, gained even more sharply in other
measures of national sentiment after a strong showing by his
Bavarian allies in a state election Sunday.
	   In the direct personality contest, Schroeder slid seven
percentage points to 50 percent support, while Kohl clawed back
three points to 39 percent.
	   Only 46 percent still believed in an opposition victory, down
from 58 percent last week, and those forecasting re-election for
Kohl increased from 25 percent to 37 percent.
	   Currently, Schroeder could form a left-leaning government with
the small Greens party only if the former East German communists
drop out of parliament, the poll said.
	   Pollsters from the Forschungsgruppe Wahlen organization
interviewed 1,290 eligible voters for the survey. The margin of
error was plus or minus 2.5 percent.

Prime minister gives into to opposition demands on bank reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from prime minister 4th, 7th grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to break an embarrassing deadlock ahead of
his visit to the United States next week, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Friday bowed to opposition demands on a crucial set of
bills to clean up Japan's debt-laden banks.
	   Obuchi agreed to nationalize one of Japan's largest banks, the
ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and curtail the powers of
the Ministry of Finance, which is widely blamed for getting the
banking industry into its mess.
	   The prime minister expressed confidence that the legislation
would provide relief to the financial system and help Japan beat
its recession.
	   ``Funds will flow smoothly to companies in need of funding and
this will be factor to perk up the economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The breakthrough followed marathon negotiations that continued
through the night and called off at 5 a.m. Friday (2000 GMT
Thursday) after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement. They
resumed negotiations later.
	   The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Naoto Kan,
claimed complete victory.
	   ``Today's agreement basically represents the total acceptance of
the (opposition) parties' proposals,'' Kan said.
	   The bills are aimed at cleaning up some 76 trillion yen (dlrs
575 billion) in bad loans that have burdened the nation's banks
since the collapse of the property market in the early 1990s.
	   Under intense pressure from abroad and from Japanese voters,
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to get the
bills passed to fix the bad loan problem.
	   But the opposition, which controls enough seats in the upper
house of Japan's bicameral legislature to block the bills, has
demanded several significant changes.
	   One of the biggest points of contention was curtailing the
powers of Japan's mighty Finance Ministry. The prime minister
agreed to their demands to transfer oversight of financial markets
from the ministry to a new committee by next June.
	   Another was to let bad banks fail and limit the use of taxpayer
money to protect depositors and healthy borrowers.
	   Obuchi originally sought to draw from a 13 trillion-yen (dlrs
100 billion) pool of public funds that had been set aside to prop
up banks to avoid shocks to the financial system. The opposition
wants the pool eliminated.
	   The debate came to a head over a ruling party proposal to spend
part of the money to bail out cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   Under Friday's agreement, the prime minister gave into
opposition demands that public money be used to clean up the bank's
bad loans only after placing it under government control _
effectively proclaiming it bankrupt.
	   The opposition parties have also sought greater disclosure of
the failed bank's financial records, the resignation of executives
and writing off as many bad loans as possible using stockholders'
capital before introducing taxpayer money.
	   Obuchi wanted an agreement Friday before he meets President
Clinton Tuesday in New York.
	   After a deal was reached, he told reporters that he was happy to
have the chance to explain to Clinton Japan's strategy to stabilize
its financial sector.
	   Top U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, who visited Tokyo this week, have criticized Japan for
dragging its feet and not doing more to revive its economy and ease
the economic crisis in Asia.
	   The impasse over the bills has roiled world financial markets by
stirring fears that Japan will not be able to pull itself out of
its longest recession in half a century.

New government offensive causes fresh refugees exodus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A new Serb government offensive in northern Kosovo
has emptied at least 13 villages and sent more than 10,000 ethnic
Albanians fleeing, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo is worsening by the day,''
said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   About 300,000 people have been displaced and scores of villages
destroyed by the Serb attacks against Albanian rebels. Many of the
displaced are struggling to survive in the open as the harsh Balkan
winter approaches.
	   Some have spilled over the border into neighboring countries.
About 9,000 ethnic Albanians have fled to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
placing additional strains on authorities still trying to cope with
the aftermath of the Bosnian war. About 500 ethnic Albanians
blocked UNHCR's offices in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on
Thursday, appealing for shelter and food, said Janowski.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, Janowski said. Many were
reportedly sick or wounded.
	   The latest government offensive, which began earlier this week,
is concentrated on 13 villages in a previously peaceful region some
30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital, Pristina. At the
last census in 1991 about 10,000 people lived in the area.
	   Janowski said Serb soldiers and police prevented UNHCR from
entering the area, although U.N. staff could see smoke coming from
one of the villages, Bajgora.
	   On the road, UNHCR staff met a family of 13, including nine
women and children, crammed into the wagon of their tractor. They
had escaped from Bajgora and had slept in open fields in drenching
rain for the previous two nights. An old woman in the wagon was
crying.
	   All the villagers told the same story, said Janowski. They
received word they would be attacked and so fled. Shortly after the
shelling started.
	   The United Nations is sending daily convoys to the displaced but
has warned this will not be enough to prevent a tragedy this
winter.

Hundreds of Hamas supporters stone Israeli soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 12 Palestinians injured, CORRECTS that suspect in
shooting was ordered held for two, sted eight days, UPDATES with
Ross-Arafat meeting over &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Venting their anger over Israel's
killing of two Hamas fugitives, hundreds of the group's supporters
on Friday stoned Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement and
exhorted Hamas bombmakers to ``blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Israeli troops deployed outside the Psagot settlement fired
rubber bullets to disperse some 500 stone throwers who yelled
``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, as they twirled slingshots.
	   Twelve Palestinians were injured, including one who was in
serious condition with a chest injury.
	   Palestinian riot police formed a human chain to try and prevent
more people from reaching the scene. The stone throwers had broken
away from a Hamas rally held in nearby El Bireh to protest Israel's
Sept. 11 killing of Imad and Adel Awadallah, two Hamas fugitives.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip two days before the Jewish New Year. Israeli
intelligence officials said they had warnings that Hamas planned to
kidnap Israeli soldiers and detonate bombs in Israeli cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   The heightened tensions came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made a
final effort to salvage his latest peace mission and narrow the
gaps between Israel and the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
pullback.
	   After a 90-minute meeting with Arafat in Gaza City on Friday,
Ross said he would hold more talks with Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators before leaving for Washington on Saturday.
	   Ross said he had encountered goodwill on both sides, but that a
lot of work remained to be done.
	   The Hamas rally in El Bireh, the hometown of Awadallah brothers,
drew some 3,000 people after Muslim noon prayers Friday. The
Awadallahs, who had been involved in plotting suicide bombings in
Israel, were shot to death in an Israeli army raid of their hideout
near Hebron.
	   Shaking their fists in anger, the marchers demanded that the
killings be avenged by the new chief bombmaker, known as Abu Hunud.
	   ``Abu Hunud, blow up, blow up Tel Aviv,'' the crowd chanted.
``Abu Hunud, oh hero, we want you to kidnap Israeli soldiers.''
	   After the rally, several hundred Hamas supporters marched toward
the nearby settlement of Psagot where they hurled stones at two
Israeli army jeeps blocking the access road.
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the Awadallah
brothers, and Israel army radio said there was concern that Hamas
would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force
Israel to release the bodies.
	   The warnings of large-scale Hamas dominated Israeli media
Friday. One newspaper wrote that Hamas planned to set off car bombs
in major Israeli cities. A headline in another paper said, ``Hamas
plans an attack like Kenya,'' referring to last month's explosion
on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   Also Friday, about 600 mourners joined the funeral procession of
17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, who was shot dead the day before,
apparently by a Jewish settler, in the West Bank village of
Beitunia.
	   Witnesses said Kabasma was killed and another teen-ager wounded
when they were fired on from a car with Israeli license plates.
	   The suspect, Avshalom Ladani, 35, a resident of the Dolev
settlement, turned himself in on Thursday, several hours after the
shooting.
	   On Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered Ladani held until
Sunday. Ladani said his car was attacked by rock-throwers. He told
police that he fired in the air and was not aware anyone was hit.
	   The Israeli army announced that it was reimposing a complete
closure of the West Bank and Gaza, starting at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT)
Friday. The restrictions, which bar all Palestinians from entering
Israel, will not be lifted before Wednesday, the first day after
the two-day New Year's holiday.

Japan's steelmakers to reduce shipments of steel exports to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's steelmakers agreed Friday to reduce exports
to the United States in order to ease bilateral trade tension, a
government spokesman said.
	   Officials from major steelmakers made the promise in a meeting
with Japan's Minister of Trade and Industry Kaoru Yosano, said
ministry spokesman Ryusuke Takashima.
	   The chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, Akira
Chihaya, said the move would help avoid ``raising a fuss'' over
trade frictions, according to Takashima.
	   According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, imports of
steel products from Japan more than doubled in the first half of
the year, compared with the same period of 1997.
	   On Thursday, Yosano told visiting U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky that U.S.-bound steel exports will fall toward
the end of this year.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. Commerce Under Secretary David L. Aaron
said the United States is being inundated with cheap steel and that
it is investigating whether Japan, Russia and South Korea are
engaged in dumping.
	   In the mid-1980s, Japanese steelmakers curbed their steel
exports to the United States in response to a U.S. government
request.

Australia says Japan's experimental tuna fishing results are
</HEADLINE>
invalid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japan is likely to seek an increase in
its catch quota for Southern Bluefin Tuna based on the results of
its experimental fishing program, but Australia said Friday the
program is fundamentally flawed.
	   Japan on Wednesday announced it fished a total of 1,363 metric
tons of tuna in its experimental fishing program, conducted in the
Indian Ocean between July 10 and Aug. 31.
	   The program, aimed at investigating tuna stocks in waters where
tuna boats do not usually operate, was carried out despite
criticisms by Australia and New Zealand, the two other members of
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
	   ``The catch per operation in the experimental fishing program
was at an average of 76 percent of regular operations, verifying
Japan's hypothesis that tuna stocks are recovering,'' an official
at Japan's Fisheries Agency said.
	   ``And we hope to add this scientific proof to our claims at the
negotiation table,'' the official said.
	   The data will be analyzed by a group of Japanese scientists
before the end of the year, and will be offered to Australia and
New Zealand if they request it.
	   However, a spokesman for Resources Minister Senator Warwick
Parer said the result was scientifically useless.
	   ``Australia has consistently warned that the design of the
experimental fishing program is flawed, and we have always said
that because of the design problem, it will invariably generate a
result that shows there are more fish out there than our scientists
believe.
	   ``So it is no surprise to us at all that the program produced
such results,'' the spokesman said.
	   However, Parer office welcomed Japan's move to crack down on
Flag of Convenience tuna vessels as ``a big positive step.''
	   Flag of Convenience vessels, not operating under the flag of
countries that have regional fisheries pacts in waters they trawl,
are creating loopholes in fishing quota agreements.
	   Non-commissioned catches of tuna around Australia by such ships
have risen rapidly and are now estimated at around 5,000 tons
annually. The total annual quota for the three member countries of
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna is
11,750 tons.
	   Some Japanese industry sources say 2,000 to 3,000 tons of
Southern Bluefin Tuna caught by Flag of Convenience vessels are
shipped to Japan every year.
	   The Japanese government is currently preparing legal action that
would prevent Japanese fishermen from serving on Flag of
Convenience vessels.
	   It is also attempting to prevent imports of fish caught by such
vessels.
	   Negotiations over setting the quota for tuna fishing will
continue between Japan, Australia and New Zealand after the Oct. 3
Australian election.

Ex-head of German power station jailed for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A former director of a German power
company convicted of defrauding his employer of 7.5 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.5 million) was sentenced Friday to
seven years in jail.
	   The betrayal by Gert Juergen Gratz, 49, caused stress for
workers, who were too frightened to question his irregular
transactions as a senior executive, the judge said.
	   Gratz was commercial director of the Melbourne arm of a company
building power stations, the Frankfurt-based Lurgi AG, and managing
director of a subsidiary, Lucon.
	   Supreme Court Justice John Coldrey said Gratz had set out to
create a lavish lifestyle for himself over 3 1/2 years.
	   By the time he was unmasked in April 1995, Gratz, a German, had
acquired eight Victorian state properties, including two farms.
	   Gratz pleaded guilty to charges of theft, false accounting and
making a false document. The judge ordered him to serve a minimum
non-parole term of four years.
	   He held executive responsibility for contracts with clients and
suppliers and for financial administration of both Lurgi and Lucon.
	   The judge said Gratz reported to the boards of Lurgi and Lucon
and to the German parent company on the financial position of both
the Australian organizations.
	   The defrauding involved ``repeated deliberate acts of
dishonesty, including the creation of false invoices, false
purchase orders and the by-passing of accounting procedures,'' the
judge said.
	   Gratz also set up private companies to receive the stolen money.
	   The man he replaced as Lucon's managing director, Herbert
Dietrich, was suspected of helping him steal the money, according
to court testimony. But Dietrich, who is also German, had fled to
Germany and could not be extradited.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A campaign manager for the right-wing
One Nation party quit Friday after a newspaper reported that her
phone numbers were the same as those for a ``Mistress Amber,'' who
offers bondage and other erotic services.
	   Linda Farrell, campaign manager for Ian Hale, a One Nation
candidate for the western Sydney seat of Parramatta, denied she was
``Mistress Amber.''
	   She said she was the victim of a smear campaign to discredit One
Nation, the new populist party founded by anti-Asian,
anti-Aboriginal independent lawmaker Pauline Hanson.
	   ``We have done nothing wrong; we have not committed a crime.
It's just to denigrate and destroy One Nation,'' Farrell said.
	   Farrell said the ``Mistress Amber'' service was being run out of
another house on her North Parramatta property.
	   The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Friday that the business
and mobile phone numbers for ``Mistress Amber'' were the same as
Farrell's.
	   Hale said he was stunned by the report.

Cathay expected to join Qantas alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways is expected to
end months of speculation by joining Qantas Airways, British
Airways and American Airlines in a global alliance, a report said
Friday.
	   An announcement by the chief executives of the airlines is
expected to be made Monday in London, the domestic news agency
Australian Associated Press said.
	   The new force would create a fierce competitor to the emerging
Singapore Airlines-Lufthansa led Star alliance, which also includes
Ansett and Air New Zealand.
	   The new alliance would prove important to Qantas and British
Airways for their plans to strengthen their operations into China.
	   The new alliance would control about 17 percent of world air
traffic.
	   Meanwhile, Qantas announced Friday that it had entered a
codeshare agreement with Swissair that would see shared services
between Australia and Switzerland, via Singapore.
	   The agreement would see Swissair codeshare on three Qantas
flights a week between Sydney and Singapore, departing Tuesdays,

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways is expected to
end months of speculation by joining Qantas Airways, British
Airways and American Airlines in a global alliance, a report said
Friday.
	   An announcement by the chief executives of the airlines is
expected to be made Monday in London, the domestic news agency
Australian Associated Press said.
	   The new force would create a fierce competitor to the emerging
Singapore Airlines-Lufthansa led Star alliance, which also includes
Ansett, Air New Zealand, United Airlines, Brazil's Varig and Air
Canada.
	   The new alliance would prove important to Qantas and British
Airways for their plans to strengthen their operations into China.
	   The new alliance would control about 17 percent of world air
traffic.
	   Meanwhile, Qantas announced Friday that it had entered a
codeshare agreement with Swissair that would see shared services
between Australia and Switzerland, via Singapore.
	   The agreement would see Swissair codeshare on three Qantas
flights a week between Sydney and Singapore, departing Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays from Oct. 27.
	   Qantas would codeshare on the three nonstop Swissair flights
each week between Singapore and Zurich.
	   ``The total number of people traveling between Australia and

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - The chief international
election official warned Bosnian Serb radicals Friday against
celebrating their self-declared electoral victory, hinting they
could face punishment if demonstrations continue.
	   Any such victory would be a setback for U.S.-led efforts to
boost the popularity of moderates now in power in the Serb half of

	   Bracing for such a possibility, a U.S. envoy said Friday only
those who support the Dayton peace agreement meant to re-establish
peace and democracy would get American aid.

Banja Luka, the Serb city in northern Bosnia. ``If they do, we will
support them _ if they do not, they will get no support from the
U.S., including economic support.''

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Venting their anger Friday over
Israel's killing of two Hamas fugitives, hundreds of the group's
supporters stoned Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement and
exhorted Hamas bombmakers to ``blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Israeli troops deployed outside the Psagot settlement fired
rubber bullets to disperse some 500 stone throwers who yelled
``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, as they twirled slingshots.
	   Twelve Palestinians were injured, including one who was in
serious condition.
	   Palestinian riot police formed a human chain to try to prevent
more people from reaching the scene. The stone throwers had broken
away from a Hamas rally held in nearby El Bireh to protest Israel's
Sept. 11 killing of Imad and Adel Awadallah, two Hamas fugitives.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip two days before the Jewish New Year. Israeli
intelligence officials said they had warnings that Hamas planned to
kidnap Israeli soldiers and detonate bombs in Israeli cities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of not doing enough to fight terrorism.
	   ``There is a poisonous cancer growing in the areas under
Palestinian control,'' Netanyahu told Israeli army radio. ``It
threatens us, it threatens them, and we must fight it.''
	   The heightened tensions came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made a
final effort to salvage his latest peace mission and narrow the
gaps between Israel and the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
pullback.
	   After a 90-minute meeting Friday with Arafat in Gaza City, Ross
said he would hold more talks with Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators before leaving Saturday for Washington.
	   Ross said he had encountered goodwill on both sides, but that a
lot of work remained to be done.
	   The Hamas rally in El Bireh, the hometown of Awadallah brothers,
drew some 3,000 people after Muslim noon prayers Friday. The
Awadallahs, who had been involved in plotting suicide bombings in
Israel, were shot to death in an Israeli army raid of their hideout
near Hebron.
	   Shaking their fists in anger, the marchers demanded that the
killings be avenged by the new chief bombmaker, known as Abu Hunud.
	   ``Abu Hunud, blow up, blow up Tel Aviv,'' the crowd chanted.
``Abu Hunud, oh hero, we want you to kidnap Israeli soldiers.''
	   After the rally, several hundred Hamas supporters marched toward
the nearby settlement of Psagot where they hurled stones at two
Israeli army jeeps blocking the access road.
	   Israel has refused to hand over the bodies of the Awadallah
brothers, and Israel army radio said there was concern that Hamas
would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to force
Israel to release the bodies.
	   Also Friday, about 600 mourners joined the funeral procession of
17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, who was shot dead the day before,
apparently by a Jewish settler, in the West Bank village of
Beitunia.
	   Witnesses said Kabasma was killed and another teen-ager wounded
when they were fired on from a car with Israeli license plates.
	   The suspect, Avshalom Ladani, 35, a resident of the Dolev
settlement, turned himself in on Thursday, several hours after the
shooting. On Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered Ladani held
until Sunday.
	   Ladani said his car was attacked by rock-throwers. He told
police that he fired in the air and was not aware anyone was hit.

compensation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government on Friday recognized the
floods that hit large parts of Belgium over the past week as a
natural disaster, opening the way for citizens to claim damages.
	   After five days of flooding in northern and eastern parts of
Belgium, water levels slowly receded Friday and people started to
go home again after spending several nights in relief shelters.
	   The floods started on Sunday, when the worst rain in decades
blanked huge areas of lowlands around the Antwerp port city. Rivers
broke their banks in the eastern Ardennes hills one day later.
	   The overwhelming majority of homes were not insured for such
damages. The government's recognition of a natural disaster will
make public funds available for those hard hit by the floods.
	   The disaster lists municipalities from four of Belgium's ten
provinces. The government took the decision after assessing reports
from the provincial governors.
	   The floods forced the evacuation of hundreds of people,
especially the old and sick, and killed at least one woman who
drowned in her car on Tuesday.

EU commissioner says new Athens airport on track
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Athens' new international airport is
expected to be finished on time and before the 2004 Summer
Olympics, the European Union's transport commissioner said Friday.
	   Neil Kinnock said construction of the airport, which began in
September 1996, is already 37 percent completed.
	   Kinnock said he was positive that ``it will be 50 percent
finished at the end of the year'' and was satisfied that it was
``absolutely on schedule.''
	   The airport is to be completed by 2000 and is expected to handle
the majority of visitors attending the 2004 Games. Completion of
the airport, which is being built by a German consortium, was a
main selling point for Athens' bid.
	   Under construction in Spata, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast
of Athens, it will have an initial annual capacity of 16 million
passengers. It is expected to handle up to 600 flights daily and
220,000 tons of cargo a year.
	   The airport will be named after Eleftherios Venizelos, a prime
minister who dominated Greek politics before World War II.
	   The current beach front airport on outskirts of the capital is
expected to remain operational until the Olympics. It will then be
turned into a park.

Election official critical of premature Serb victory celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's chief international
election official warned Bosnian Serb extremists Friday against
celebrating their self-declared electoral victory, hinting they
could face punishment if demonstrations continue.
	   Any such victory would be a setback for U.S.-led efforts to
boost the popularity of moderates now in power in the Serb half of
Bosnia through reconstruction aid and other support.
	   Cheering backers of Nikola Poplasen, leader of the Serb Radical
Party, have been celebrating in Bosnian Serb towns, proclaiming
that he defeated the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in last
weekend's vote for president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Bracing for such a possibility, a U.S. envoy said Friday only
those who support the Dayton peace agreement meant to re-establish
peace and democracy in Bosnia would get American aid.
	   ``What we are interested in is, whoever is in power, that they
implement the Dayton agreement,'' envoy Robert Gelbard told
reporters in Banja Luka, a Serb city in northern Bosnia. ``If they
do, we will support them _ if they do not, they will get no support
from the U.S., including economic support.''
	   Western officials admit Plavsic is trailing but have refused to
release any figures from the Saturday-Sunday balloting, citing a
complicated ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the need
for accuracy.
	   A win by Poplasen, an ally of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic, would call into question the U.S.-European strategy to
rebuild Bosnia-Herzegovina after the 3 1/2-year war, which has been
to funnel millions of dollars in aid to those who support a
multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   ``We are in the process of suggesting to the (Serb) Radical
party and to Mr. Poplasen that it would not be in his interest to
have these demonstrations,'' said Robert Barry, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe office here.
	   Barry said that if protests continue, ``we will have to take
them into account in terms of our reaction.''
	   The OSCE, which supervised the election, has the authority to
disqualify candidates of parties which violate campaign rules.
	   Barry refused to say whether OSCE was prepared to do that but
added, ``We cannot allow efforts to intimidate this process to go
on.''
	   Western officials admit that disqualifying Poplasen could
trigger a violent reaction among his followers and threaten the
Bosnian peace process. Bosnian Serbs have urged OSCE to release
results, but Barry's office said that could take another five or
six days.
	   In Banja Luka, an official of Poplasen's party, Pantelija
Damjanovic, warned that if the OSCE ``comes up with an unjust
decision,'' it would ``cause grave problems and great evil .... We
shall await the decision, hoping it will not be unjust.''
	   But a Plavsic ally, Milorad Dodik, urged the OSCE to disqualify
Poplasen for violating campaign rules by granting an interview to
Serb television after the deadline for such broadcasts.
	   Dodik, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic, said he
was willing to accept disqualification for his own breach of the
rules _ giving an interview to a local newspaper after the
deadline.
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists at the
election, despite international efforts to boost Plavsic and her
coalition by supplying millions of dollars of economic aid.
	   But much of that aid has not trickled down to rural Bosnian
Serbs. And anger among Bosnian Serbs may have been been rekindled
because of clashes in the Serbian province of Kosovo with largely
Muslim ethnic Albanians.
	   Under the Dayton plan, Bosnia is divided into a Serb republic
and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters cast ballots for a
three-member presidency _ one Muslim, one Croat, one Serb _ and a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity and
region. The Serb republic also voted for president of its entity.

First strike of school year; teachers protest hiring freeze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Teachers across France walked off the job Friday to
protest a hiring freeze by the leftist government, and thousands
staged a march in the capital during the first strike of the new
school year.
	   Of nearly 667,000 of the teachers in kindergartens, junior high
and high schools nationwide, at least 11.3 percent were on strike,
the National Education Ministry said at midday.
	   Officials with the United Trade Union Federation (FSU) put the
overall figure at about 35 percent, and 50 percent in high schools.
	   Participation in the Paris region was particularly strong, with
the ministry reporting 18 percent of the teachers there were on
strike. A ministry spokeswoman said they had no figures on school
closures.
	   Several thousand teachers marched Friday afternoon on the Left
Bank toward the ministry building, with a banner reading ``More
public education ensures the future of our children.''
	   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has
sought to control the government deficit to under 3 percent of the
gross domestic product, as required by the euro currency that takes
effect at the end of the year.

Floods in west threaten power supply in north India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Cabinet minister details, deaths in
western Indian state. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Flooding in western India has inundated
the supply end of a major pipeline that fuels power plants in
northern India's industrial hubs, a Cabinet minister said Friday.
	   The supply point of a 1,700-kilometer (1,000-mile) natural gas
pipeline was affected by the flooding in the western Gujarat state.
Supplies were cut off Thursday morning to several natural
gas-fueled power plants and fertilizer factories in northern Uttar
Pradesh, India's most populous state.
	   ``We hope to restore supplies within a week,'' Minister for
Petroleum and Natural Gas V.K. Ramamurthy told reporters.
	   The Times of India quoted officials as saying supplies on hand
at the plants would run out in 36 hours.
	   The petroleum ministry called an emergency meeting Thursday at
which officials began preparing to supply alternative fuels to the
plants from reserves in western Maharashtra and northeastern Assam
states, Ramamurthy said.
	   Nearly 25 people have died in the last three days in the western
state of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the capital, as heavy
rains brought down mud-and-tin homes and swollen rivers inundated
villages in low-lying areas.
	   Police said nine people, including three children, were missing
from Manor village, near Thane, near Bombay. They were swept away
when the waters of the Surya River flooded their village, police
said. Flood waters began receding Friday after three days of
incessant rain.

Russian parliament agrees to lift immunity from Dagestani member
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament agreed Friday to
lift the immunity of one of its members who stands accused of
storming a government building in Russia's republic of Dagestan
last spring, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian prosecutors had requested that parliamentary immunity be
lifted from Nadir Khachilayev, who leads Russia's Muslim Union, a
leading organization of Russian Muslims. He is suspected of
organizing a May 21 raid on the government building in the
Dagestani capital Makhachkala with his brother, Magomed
Khachilayev.
	   The two brothers' supporters took several policemen and
officials hostage, but left peacefully after receiving promises of
a shakeup in the local government.
	   Magomed Khachilayev, who leads an organization representing an
ethnic minority in Dagestan, the Laks, was arrested in Makhachkala
earlier this month but Nadir Khachilayev managed to escape.
	   Oleg Morozov, the leader of the Russia's Regions parliamentary
group, said that the lower house, or State Duma, had agreed that
Nadir Khachilayev should be liable to prosecution, Interfax said.

Czechs see no successor to Havel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs have no idea who might be a
successor to Vaclav Havel although the country is evenly split over
whether the oft-ailing president should step down.
	   According to a poll released by the Sofres-Factum agency Friday,
almost two-thirds of the population cannot imagine anybody other
than Havel as Czech president.
	   ``The survey's results make it clear there is no personality who
would be perceived ... as a suitable successor to Vaclav Havel,''
the authors were quoted as saying.
	   The closest contender, parliament Speaker Vaclav Klaus, has the
support of 7.1 percent of the population and Premier Milos Zeman
has 4.7 percent support.
	   While Klaus is known to have presidential ambitions, Zeman has
repeatedly stated he will quit politics when his term expires in
four years.
	   According to the poll, 47.2 percent of those surveyed think
Havel should quit his job for health reasons, while 48.5 percent
think he should stay.
	   Havel, who spearheaded Czechoslovakia's anti-communist
revolution, became president in December 1989. After the
federation's breakup in 1993, he became Czech president and was
re-elected for his final five-year term Jan. 20.
	   At 61, the cancer-battling president no longer enjoys the
political power he once had, but is seen as the country's father
figure in the post-communist era.
	   The agency surveyed 1,063 people at the end of August and
beginning of September. The poll has a 3 percent margin of error.

Australia says Japan's experimental quota.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   A spokesman for Resources Minister Sen. Warwick Parer said the
results were scientifically useless because the program is designed
to show more fish than there actually are in the waters.
	   Japan said Wednesday that it fished a total of 1,363 tons of
tuna in its program conducted in the Indian Ocean between July 10
and Aug. 31.
	   The program, which tries to assess tuna stocks in waters where
tuna boats do not usually operate, was carried out despite
criticism by Australia and New Zealand, the two other members of
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
	   An official at Japan's Fisheries Agency said the program showed
that tuna stocks were recovering.
	   The data will be analyzed by a group of Japanese scientists this
year and will be offered to Australia and New Zealand, if they
request it, he said.
	   Parer's office welcomed Japan's move to crack down on Flag of
Convenience tuna vessels as ``a big positive step.''
	   Flag of Convenience vessels, not operating under the flag of
countries that have regional fisheries pacts, are creating
loopholes in fishing quota agreements.
	   Non-commissioned catches of tuna around Australia by such ships
have risen rapidly and are now estimated at around 5,000 tons
annually.
	   The total annual quota for the three member countries of the
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna is 11,750
tons.
	   Some Japanese industry sources say 2,000 to 3,000 tons of
Southern Bluefin Tuna caught by Flag of Convenience vessels are
shipped to Japan every year.
	   The Japanese government is preparing legal action that would
prevent Japanese fishermen from serving on Flag of Convenience
vessels. It is also attempting to prevent imports of fish caught by
such vessels.
	   Negotiations over setting the quota for tuna fishing will
continue among Japan, Australia and New Zealand after the Oct. 3
Australian election.

Armenian terrorist group displays its records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An Armenian terrorist group that has
killed dozens of Turkish officials and planted deadly airport bombs
put its records on display Friday in the National Library in the
Armenian capital Yerevan.
	   The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA)
was founded in 1975. Active in the Armenian diaspora, it seeks the
foundation of an Armenian state in eastern Turkey and vengeance for
the alleged genocide against 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks
in 1915-1916.
	   The exhibition consists of books and media publications about
ASALA, along with some manuscripts and photographs of its militants
who died in action.
	   ``Armenia knows little about ASALA, and we are now turning over
these documents to the National Library in order to let researchers
study our activities,'' said Vazgen Petrosian, a representative of
the Armenian Popular Movement, ASALA's political wing.
	   Petrosian said ASALA had carried out more than 350 actions since
1975, most of them aimed against Turkish diplomats and other
officials throughout the world.
	   He also said the group had carried out three actions this year,
but didn't say what they were.
	   ASALA's founder Agop Agopian was gunned down in Athens in April
1988. The Turkish government was widely believed to be behind his
assassination, but officials have denied the charges.
	   Among ASALA's attacks was the 1983 bombing of the Turkish
Airlines desk at Paris Orly Airport, which killed eight people and
wounded 56.

Thomas wins 400 for Wales; Oakes makes it six medals in six Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's, women's 400 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Iwan Thomas left his Welsh
teammate Jamie Baulch trailing in fourth and charged to the
Commonwealth Games 400-meter gold medal in a games record Friday to
add the title to last month's European Championship triumph.
	   The tall fair-haired Welshman, who had shared a good-natured
exchange of words, tongue pulling and arm gestures with Baulch in
the final stages of the semifinal, turned on the power with 80
meters to go to take the title in 44.52 seconds.
	   England's Mark Richardson took the silver in 44.60 and Sugath
Thilakaratne of Sri Lanka caught the fading Baulch to take the
bronze in 44.64. Thomas' time bettered the 44.60 of Australia's
Darren Clark, set eight years ago at Auckland, and his latest
triumph came only a week after he won the World Cup 400 meters in
Johannesburg.
	   Baulch flopped on the track after his loss and was later helped
up by his Welsh teammate. As the two left the track arm in arm, the
emotional Baulch held Thomas' arm aloft as if to say ``he's the
winner.''
	   Flashing a new golden wave in her dark hair, defending champion
Judy Oakes gained a medal for the sixth Commonwealth Games in a
row, winning her third gold.
	   The 40-year-old English athlete heaved 18.83 meters with her
first throw in the shot put to virtually put herself out of reach
of the other seven competitors. Second-place Myrtle Augee made it
an English 1-2 but was 1.67 meters short of Oakes' effort. South
Africa's Johanna Abrahamse captured the bronze with a best of
16.52.
	   Friday's triumph makes it three golds, two silvers and a bronze
since Oakes made her games debut at Edmonton in 1978. She won a
bronze there, gold in Brisbane in '82, silver at Edinburgh in '86
and Auckland '90 and gold at Victoria, British Columbia, four years
ago. She is the only track and field athlete to win a medal at six
games in a row.
	   Bronze medalist four years ago and world championship runner-up
in 1997, Sandie Richards of Jamaica finally collected gold in the
400 meters. A former world indoor titlist, she clocked a games
record 50.17 seconds to run clear of Scotland's Alison Curbishley,
50.71, and England's Donna Fraser, 51.01.
	   Onichie Achike gained another gold for England with a games
record in the triple jump while Stuart Rendell captured Australia's
third hammer title in a row, and Andrea Blackett of Barbados also
set a games mark to win the women's 400-meter hurdles.
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards not at the Games
because of a foot operation, Achike and Julian Golley were
England's big hopes in the triple jump.
	   Achike opened with a leap of 16.98 to take the lead and came up
with his record 17.10 in round four. His four other attempts were
no jumps. Andrew Owusu of Ghana collected silver with 17.03, Remmy
Limo gained the bronze with 16.89 and Golley, who was favored to
win in Edwards' absence, failed to medal in fourth with 16.83.
	   In the 400 hurdles, Blackett clocked 53.91 seconds, pulling away
from England's Gowry Retchakan-Hodge, who clocked 55.25, and
Karlene Houghton of Canada, who had 55.53. Her time beat the 54.51
run by former Olympic champion Sally Gunnell at Victoria four years
ago.
	   Rendell threw 74.71 meters to capture Australia's second hammer
gold, following Debbie Sosimenko's victory in the women's event.
	   England's Michael Jones placed second with 74.02 and South
Africa's Chris Harmse took the bronze with a best heave of 72.83.
Rendell, who succeeds two-time winner Sean Carlin, had the best
three throws of the final.
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas, who triumphed in Thursday's
100-meter final, pulled out of the 200 heats Friday. Fastest
qualifier for Saturday's semifinal was Australia's Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor, returning to action after a knee injury.
	   The fastest qualifier for Saturday's women's 800-meter final was
from Mozambique and it wasn't former world champion Maria Mutola.
	   Argentina Paulino clocked 2 minutes, 00.11 seconds to win the
first semifinal and Mutola's time in the second after a slowly run
race was 2:02.84. Mutola, the three-time world indoor titlist, was
followed home by Diane Modahl, the English runner who won the 1990
Games title and was prevented from defending it in '94 by a drugs
ban that was later quashed.
	   Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng, runner-up at the Games
four years ago, cruised into the men's 800 final although Kenya's
Japhet Kimutai was fastest qualifier with 1:46.88.

Publisher says Starr outselling Diana in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Booksellers in Britain clamored Friday for copies
of the paperback book version of the Starr report, creating what
the publisher called an unprecedented demand.
	   ``It is incredible,'' said Sarah Yorke Palmer, spokeswoman for
publisher Orion. ``We have nothing to compare to this _ not even
after Diana died and we brought out a special hardback book.''
	   In two days, 95,000 copies of ``The Starr Report _ The
Uncensored Evidence'' _ with its lurid descriptions of sex between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and a White House intern _ have been
sold to book stores from an initial print run of 100,000, said
Palmer.
	   Orion expects tht even after the initial surge of interest
levels off, strong sales of the 4.99 pound (dlrs 8.33) book will
continue.
	   Another edition of the Starr report will be printed by Pocket
Books, a division of Simon and Schuster, and on sale in this
country next week for 3.99 pounds (dlrs 6.68).
	   However, the Bookseller's Association predicted demand will
plummet once readers' curiosity wanes.
	   ``The report is on the Internet, so people who are really
interested will have already seen it,'' spokesman Tim Godfrey said.
	   Bookseller W.H. Smith ordered 10,000 copies and was putting
5,500 out on the shelves of 400 stores around the country Friday,
spokeswoman Shirley Nokes said.
	   ``We will be watching this carefully, as we don't know what the
British public will think about the book,'' she said.

EU, South Africa fail to clinch trade deal

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Negotiations between the European Union
and South Africa aimed at clinching a free trade agreement this
week failed, a South African official said Friday.
	   ``We encountered some real difficulties,'' the official, who
demanded anonymity, said at the end of the twenty-first round of
trade talks.
	   He declined to provide details.
	   Earlier this week, officials from both sides had expressed
optimism that they could achieve a breakthrough, although several
core issues remained to be settled. Notably, the 15-nation EU and
South Africa still have to work out the scope and timing of tariff
reductions on a range of industrial and agricultural goods.
	   An agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of bilateral trade,
worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19 million).
The deal would have to be approved by all 15 member states.

Queen Elizabeth pays respect to Islam during Brunei visit

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II slipped
off her white pumps, donned a white prayer robe and gingerly padded
about one of the most magnificent mosques in modern Islam on
Friday.
	   The queen began her second day of her state visit to this
oil-rich sultanate, a former British colony on the northern tip of
Borneo island, by paying respects to Islam. Most of the 312,000
people in this tiny Southeast Asian kingdom are Muslim.
	   Wearing a blue, wide-brimmed hat and floor-length prayer robe
designed for her back in London, the queen was escorted through the
Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque.
	   In the cavernous male prayer room, some 150 men sat
crossed-legged on their golden prayer rugs in identical black felt
``songkok'' caps and embroidered sarongs as the queen strolled
behind them in her stocking feet.
	   Her gloved hands clasped, the queen softly inquired about the
gold-plated Arabic calligraphy of Koranic verse carved into the
white Italian marble.
	   ``I saw not just a beautiful building but the people gathering
for Friday prayers, the Muslim community coming together in
observance of one of the Five Pillars of that greater building
which is the Islamic faith,'' the queen said later during her
speech at the state banquet.
	   The mosque covers 20 acres (8 hectares), with 29 marble domes
and 29 white marble steps, symbolizing Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the
29th Sultan of the 600-year-old Bolkiah dynasty.
	   The queen walked through the lower courtyard to visit hundreds
of children _ girls in pink Muslim head scarves and boys in black
caps _ kneeled in front of wooden stands cradling tiny Korans.
	   She tip-toed off the red carpet, much in the successful style of
the late Princess Diana, and chatted with a few of the girls.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his new wife, Gaynor
Regan, were among those in the queen's entourage, all in stocking
feet, the women in black prayer robes.
	   Zaini Ali, the mosque architect who escorted the queen, said she
was most impressed by a compulsory pre-marital counseling class.
	   ``She was jumping up and down, she was so excited,'' said the
British-trained architect. He said the queen turned to Cook and
said, ``We should try something like this.''
	   The Church of England does not require marriage counseling. The
children of the royal couple _ celebrating their 50th wedding
anniversary last year _ have been plagued by divorce, the most
infamous between Prince Charles and Diana.
	   Zaini may not have known his comments would raise gleeful
eyebrows among the British press on the tour. The tabloids have
skewered Cook for recently leaving his wife of 28 years and
marrying his former aide.
	   In Buckingham Palace's push to promote the British royal couple
as more people-friendly, the queen also visited a health-care
clinic for women and children along the Brunei River.
	   The clinic, which practices preventative care, sits in Kampong
Ayer, or Water Village, a settlement of 2,500 rickety wooden houses
on river stilts. The small villages linked by foot-bridges dates
back to the 16th century and was the capital of Brunei until the
turn of the century.
	   The royal couple is on their first state visit to Brunei since
1972, 12 years before the sultanate gained full independence from
the United Kingdom.
	   ``We exist as an independent nation in no small part due to
Britain's help and wisdom,'' the sultan said during the state
banquet at his palace Friday night.

Prodi heads into budget battle with Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In Italy's confusing political scenario, Premier
Romano Prodi's coalition government faces an uphill battle with its
troublesome Communist allies over the 1999 budget.
	   It is unclear whether Prodi's government, which at two years and
four months has outlived all but two of Italy's other 54 postwar
governments, could survive a confidence vote if it comes up.
	   Although it is not part of the government, the Communist
Refoundation party has 34 votes Prodi needs for a majority in the
630-seat Chamber of Deputies.
	   Refoundation opposes NATO's eastward expansion and the presence
of U.S. bases on Italian soil _ positions considered anachronistic
by most Italians _ and has twice pushed the government to the brink
of collapse. Refoundation's opposition to the bases long predates
the February accident in which a U.S. Marine jet slashed a ski lift
cable, killing 20.
	   Refoundation, which won 8 percent of the vote in the 1996
elections, is what remains of Italy's old Communist Party, once the
largest in the West. Its followers still wave the party's
hammer-and-sickle flag and sing the communist anthem at gatherings.
	   Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the tiny party, has repeatedly
threatened to withdraw support unless the government does more to
stimulate job creation, especially in the depressed south. There,
the unemployment rate is above 20 percent, compared to the national
average of 12.5 percent.
	   Bertinotti, whose party's traditional base includes blue-collar
workers, also wants a 35-hour workweek and increased aid to the
poor such as tax breaks, family support payments and free school
books.
	   Prodi, however, is considered well-positioned to overcome the
looming budget impasse for two reasons: Refoundation is suffering
internal divisions, and a possible new government ally is waiting
on the sidelines.
	   Refoundation's No. 2, Armando Cossutta, disagrees with
Bertinotti's intransigence and says bringing down the government
won't do anything to improve Italy's dismal unemployment picture.
	   ``Cossutta is afraid voters will punish Refoundation for
bringing down what really is the first postwar center-left
government,'' said Patrick McCarthy, a political science professor
at the Johns Hopkins University center in Bologna.
	   ``Unless Bertinotti really wants to destroy the party, which I
think is impossible, he will have to reach an agreement with the
government,'' said Sandro Roventi, a political analyst at Milan's
Bocconi University.
	   Meanwhile, the new centrist party of Francesco Cossiga, a former
president and an ex-Christian Democrat premier, might be willing to
again bail out the government.
	   When the Communists refused to vote in favor of NATO expansion
in June, Cossiga's followers came to the government's rescue.
	   It was the second time the government had to be rescued when the
Communists refused to back it on a key vote. The other was over
sending Italian troops into Albania last year.
	   Insisting that the country needs stability, Prodi has declared
he intends to continue to govern for the remainder of Parliament's
term, which runs out in 2001, and has pressed Refoundation for
support.
	   Prodi's strict economic policies paid off in in May when Italy
qualified for European Monetary Union.
	   The parties in Prodi's center-left coalition have just begun
discussing the proposed budget, which Parliament must approve by
Dec. 31.
	   Even the center-right opposition appears wary of new elections
should the government fall, especially considering their leader,
former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, is appealing
corruption convictions.

	   The officials said Thursday they won't know until the final
results come in if the tests in French and Swiss laboratories back
findings by a U.S. army lab that missile fragments had traces of
the deadly nerve agent.
	   A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
preliminary results were ``inconclusive,'' because not all the
tests were complete.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler has said that even
if the French and Swiss labs don't turn up traces of VX, Baghdad
still has to answer for the findings by the Aberdeen Proving Ground
laboratory.
	   The lab disclosed in June that it found traces of VX in
fragments of missile warheads that Iraq had filled before the 1991
Gulf war. A few drops of the nerve agent can kill a person.
	   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said Thursday in Washington that
the United States stood by the Aberdeen results. The fragments
being tested in European labs came from another part of a large
destruction site, he said.
	   ``If those results are that they found no trace of VX, it will
not invalidate the U.S. findings of VX on fragments taken from
another part of the destruction field,'' he said.
 &UR; Butler agreed, 6th graf pvs

Cathay expected to join Qantas alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways is expected to
end months of speculation by joining Qantas Airways, British
Airways and American Airlines in a global alliance, Australian
Associated Press news agency reported Friday.
	   An announcement by the chief executives of the airlines is
expected Monday in London, it said.
	   The new force would create a fierce competitor to the emerging
Singapore Airlines-Lufthansa led Star alliance, which also includes
Ansett, Air New Zealand, United Airlines, Brazil's Varig and Air
Canada.
	   Controlling about 17 percent of world air traffic, the new
alliance is likely to prove key to plans by Qantas and British
Airways to strengthen their China operations.
	   Meanwhile, Qantas announced Friday that it had entered an
agreement with Swissair that would allow the two carriers to share
services between Australia and Switzerland, via Singapore.
	   Geoff Dixon, Qantas executive general manager, said that the
number of people traveling between Australia and Switzerland has
increased by an average of 6.7 percent over each of the last four
years.

Cyclists bounce back after day of drama; Oakes wins 6th medal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's cyclists put aside the
shock expulsion of world champion teammate Lucy Tyler-Sharman to
claim two golds and a silver in Commonwealth Games velodrome action
Friday.
	   Tyler-Sharman, kicked out by the Australians for criticizing
cycling team officials, was believed to be on a flight home late
Friday.
	   While Australian chef de mission Don Stockins acted swiftly to
expel Tyler-Sharman, Canadian officials stood ``100 percent''
behind their field hockey players, who were involved in ugly scenes
after a disputed loss Thursday.
	   The dramas overshadowed early competition on Day 8 Friday, but
England's long-serving athlete Judy Oakes restored some of the
gloss when she became the first track and field competitor to win a
medal at six consecutive games.
	   Oakes, sporting a golden wave in her hair, collected a medal to
match with a winning effort of 18.83 meters on her first throw.
	   Friday's triumph makes it three golds, two silvers and a bronze
since she made her games debut at Edmonton in 1978. Oakes won a
bronze there, gold in Brisbane in '82, silver at Edinburgh in '86
and Auckland '90 and gold at Victoria, British Columbia, four years
ago.
	   European and World Cup champion Iwan Thomas of Wales won a
thrilling men's 400-meter final in a games record 44.52. He held
out English rival Mark Richardson, with Sri Lanka's Sugath
Thilakaratne third.
	   With women's world 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman out injured,
Sandie Richards cruised to an easy victory, giving Jamaica its
first gold in the event.
	   Onichie Achike gained a gold for England with a games record in
the triple jump while Stuart Rendell captured Australia's third
hammer title in a row, and Andrea Blackett of Barbados also set a
games mark to win the women's 400-meter hurdles.
	   The off-track cycling drama began when Tyler-Sharman, a former
American rider who moved to Australia in 1991, accused team
officials of sabotaging her bike after both feet came out of the
pedals during her semifinal Thursday night. She also felt ill and
speculated that her drinks might have been spiked.
	   The expulsion cost Tyler-Sharman her chance to ride for bronze
in Friday's finals, and further embarrassed a cycling outfit dubbed
Team Tabloid for its constant squabbling and bitter infighting.
	   Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand beat Australian Alayna Burns by 1.3
seconds for the gold in the pursuit. Ulmer finished in 3:41.667 in
the afternoon heat and humidity, slower than the games record of
3:40.389 that Burns had set Thursday. England's Yvonne McGregor won
the bronze uncontested.
	   Australian Brad McGee broke his own games record to claim the
men's 4,000-meter individual pursuit in 4 minutes, 30.594 seconds,
beating compatriot Luke Roberts in the final. Matt Illingworth won
the bronze by outracing fellow Englishman Brad Wiggins.
	   World record holder Shane Kelly gave Australia its second gold
from the three events Friday when he won the 1-kilometer time
trial. Kelly, who won the 1997 world title after a disastrous slip
cost him a chance at the 1996 Olympics, prevailed by .4 seconds
over British record holder Jason Queally.
	   Canada's hockey players were the subject of a police report
after causing minor damage to their locker room following their 2-1
loss to Malaysia. Spokeswoman Teresa Moore said the players made a
full apology Friday and offered to cover the estimated U.S. dlrs 25
cost to repair a damaged door.
	   She said the team, which angrily confronted Scottish umpire
David Wallis after his decision allowed Malaysia's late winner,
only caused the damage because they were locked out of the dressing
room and were scared of the crowd.
	   The hosts were also involved in controversy at the boxing ring
Friday when English light flyweight Gary Jones went down 15-11 to
local fighter Sapok Biki in their semifinal.
	   ``I thought I won it and at the end of the day I've been robbed
of a gold medal,'' said Jones. ``He was nowhere near as good as
me.''
	   Malaysia picked up its fifth gold medal Friday when Nurul Huda
Baharin won the women's individual air rifle event at Langkawi
Island. She scored 494.8 points to win from Sharon Bowes of Canada
(493.3) and Louise Minett of England (491.7).
	   Canada's James Paton won the men's individual full-bore rifle
gold medal with 402 points. Malaysia's Zainal Abidin Md Zain took
the silver with 400 and Andrew Luckman of England collected the
bronze, also with 400.
	   Canadian Metodi Igorov added a gold in the men's rapid fire
pistol competition while New Zealand's Stephen Petterson, who won
two golds in small-bore rifle shooting in the 1994 games, won
another in the men's free rifle prone event. Igorov's gold,
however, was put on hold because of a South African protest calling
for proof of the Bulgarian native's Canadian nationality.
	   Australia's Olympic champion Michael Diamond won the men's
individual trap in a shootout against England's Ian R. Peel.
	   New Zealand also won the first medal on offer in cricket at the
Commonwealth Games when it beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs in the bronze
medal playoff.
	   Allrounder Chris Harris was the star with an unbeaten 55 in the
Kiwis 212-7 off 50 overs and took two wickets as Sri Lanka was all
out for 161 in the 45th. Australia will play South Africa for the
gold Saturday.
	   England claimed three gold and three silver medals in the
85-kilogram weightlifting division. Leon Griffin won two golds in
the overall and clean and jerk sections and silver in the snatch.
Stephen Ward had the snatch gold and silver in the other two
sections.
	   Australia's former world champion Kiril Kounev won all three
medals in the 94kg division with a snatch of 165kg and clean and
jerk of 205kg.
	   Despite the end of the swimming program, Australia was still
dominant at the games pool Friday. Diver Chantelle Michell bounced
to a gold medal on the 1-meter springboard, amassing 271.560 points
from her five dives to beat Canadian pair Blythe Hartley (248.280)
and Eryn Bulmer (239.400).

Pope John Paul II to begin visit in Poland June 5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish-born Pope John Paul II will
probably begin a visit to his homeland June 5, 1999, a spokesman
for Poland's bishops said Friday.
	   The visit will probably begin in the holiday resort of Sopot
near Gdansk on the Baltic coast and will last eight to nine days,
the Rev. Adam Schulz said after a meeting of church and government
representatives.
	   A draft itinerary was sent to the Vatican for approval and the
final version should be known in late December or early January,
Schulz said.
	   He added that the itinerary for the visit is very tight and
would be tiring even for a young person, therefore the Vatican
needs to verify if it is realistic.
	   In June, the daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported the pope would stop
in 12 cities, including Warsaw, Bydgoszcz, Torun, Sopot and Elk in
northern Poland; Lichen, Lowicz, Siedlce and Drohiczyn in central
and eastern Poland; and Sandomierz, Zamosc and Krakow in the south.
	   The government will do its best to insure it is ``a great
meeting - a feast for all Poles,'' said Wieslaw Walendziak, Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek's chief of staff.
	   The trip would be John Paul's eighth to Poland since becoming
pope in 1978. During his stay, he is expected to beatify more than
100 Poles killed during the World War II Nazi occupation.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stock prices opened higher on Wall Street,
interrupting a selling spree that swept markets worldwide Thursday
and was deepening in Europe and most of Asia Friday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 23.95 at 7,897.92 in the
early going. Broader indicators also were rising.
	   The early gain left the Dow slightly below where it began the
year, at 7,908.25. But it was more than 15 percent beneath its July
17 record high of 9,337.97.
	   The Dow plunged 216.01 points, or by 2.7 percent, on Thursday as
selling swept stock exchanges around the world on fears not enough
was being done to prevent economic crises in Asia and Russia from
worsening. Dire profit projections from several major international
companies added to the pessimism.
	   Brokers said the selling was touched off by disappointment that
central bankers in the world's richest nations, especially the
United States, have not moved to lower interest rates to stimulate
economic activity.
	   ``The market was bullish'' earlier this week amid hopes of a
U.S. interest rate cut, said Philip Niem, an analyst with HSBC
Securities. But these hopes have been dashed by U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent comments.
	   Thursday's selloff broke a string of four straight rising
sessions for the Dow, which had leaped 6.2 percent, or by almost
475 points during its longest winning streak since late June.
	   Adding to the volatility of markets this week is Friday's
expiration of options and futures contracts on stocks and options
on stock indexes, a quarterly event in the United States known as
``triple-witching'' day.
	   Leading indicators were lower at midday in Europe and finished
mostly lower in Asia, extending Thursday's losses.
	   The Japanese stock market's major index finished up 0.9 percent,
however, bouncing back from Thursday's 12-year low.
	   Tokyo stocks were bolstered by expectations Japan's ruling and
opposition parties would reach a compromise on banking reform in
time for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States
next week. After the Tokyo market closed, an agreement was
announced between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the main
opposition parties.
	   Market indicators fell 7.5 percent in the Philippines, 4.8
percent in Indonesia, 3 percent in Singapore and 1.7 percent in
Hong Kong.
	   In Europe, the main index in London was off by 0.9 percent by
midday and shares also were falling in Paris and in Frankfurt,
Germany.

Western ousted as head of Kenya Wildlife Service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ David Western was ousted as director of
the Kenya Wildlife Service for the second time in three months
Friday and temporarily replaced by one of his deputies.
	   ``His services have been terminated,'' said David Kioko, ``and I
have been told to be in charge until another director is
appoionted.''
	   Earlier Friday a KWS official cancelled without explanation a
news conference where Western was scheduled to speak about his
departure from the organization that watches over the animals in
Kenya's famed wildlife sanctuaries.
	   In a statement sent to news organizations after the
cancellation, Western said he had been informed by the government
Thursday it ``intends to terminate my services as director of Kenya
Wildlife Services due to adjustments it will make in the
organization and other sectors of government.''
	   Western, who was appointed to the post by President Daniel arap
Moi in 1994, defended his tenure at KWS.
	   ``The tough times and hard decisions KWS has taken have been
hard on us all,'' Western said. ``But, had those decisions not been
taken to scale down the organization, decentralize its operations
and modernize its management, it would be in a very precarious
state today.''
	   Western was first ousted May 22 but was reinstated the following
day after pressure from countries that give development aid to
Kenya, The East African Standard newspaper said at the time.
	   The newspaper said European donors cancelled dlrs 400 million in
aid earmarked for salaries and other operating expenses at Kenya
Wildlife Service after Western's ouster.
	   In reinstating Western, the government said he would serve for
nine months.
	   Western said at the time he had been ousted because he resisted
pressure from some ministries to permit more gemstone mining in
Tsavo National Park and to allocate parts of other government-owned
reserves to private use.
	   Western, 53, leaves the job when a devastating slump in tourism
revenues, blamed on political violence and floods associated with
the El Nino weather phenomenon, forced huge spending cuts within
the service.
	   Western was appointed March 28, 1994, replacing paleonthologist
Richard Leakey, who resigned amid controversy. Leakey joined
opposition politics and was nominated to parliament by his party,
Safina.

First strike of school year; teachers protest hiring freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with minister's comment, no talks planned, another
strike planned next wee; ADDS background

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Teachers across France walked off the job Friday to
protest a hiring freeze by the leftist government, and thousands
staged a march in the capital during the first strike of the new
school year.
	   Of nearly 667,000 of the teachers in kindergartens, junior high
and high schools nationwide, at least 11.3 percent were on strike,
the National Education Ministry said. No new talks were planned.
	   Officials with the United Trade Union Federation (FSU) put the
overall figure at about 35 percent, and 50 percent in high schools.
	   Participation in the Paris region was particularly strong, with
the ministry reporting 18 percent of the teachers there were on
strike.
	   A ministry spokeswoman said they had no figures on school
closures as a result of the walkout, which came barely a week after
the new school year began. Primary schools were not affected, after
the ministry reached an agreement with unions on personnel there.
	   Several thousand teachers marched Friday afternoon on the Left
Bank toward the ministry building, with a banner reading ``More
public education ensures the future of our children.''
	   The government had failed to carry out promised reform by
freezing hiring and by limiting education spending, said Laure
Caille, a spokeswoman for the National Union of Secondary
Schoolteachers, (SNES).
	   Caille said that despite a strike warning made last June, that
National Education Minister Claude Allegre ``refused to even
receive us.''
	   The ministry spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there had been no recent negotiations, only ``discussions.''
	   Allegre acknowledged that there was a lack of non-teaching
personnel, in an interview on France Inter radio. But he said the
unions are keeping ``a traditional attitude -- always increase the
number of teachers. ... It's not the right solution.''
	   The SNES, a member of the FSU federation, plans to go on strike
again next Thursday, Sept. 24. The union represents 57 percent of
secondary school teachers.
	   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has
sought to control the government deficit to under 3 percent of the
gross domestic product, as required by the euro currency that takes
effect at the end of the year.

Camacho makes seven changes in first national lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The first lineup announced by Spain's new
coach Jose Antonio Camacho Friday included seven changes from the
team that suffered a humiliating defeat against semiprofessional
Cyprus two weeks ago.
	   The exhibition match against Russia next Wednesday will be
Camacho's first as coach of the national side that was under Javier
Clemente's command.
	   Camacho replaced Clemente on Tuesday, with a mission to shine up
the squad's image tarnished by a disappointing World Cup
performance and corroded by the Cyprus defeat in a European
Championship qualifier.
	   Among the seven new call-ups only Jordi Lardin from Atletico de
Madrid has played for the national team before.
	   ``The midfield is going to be completely new,'' Camacho told
reporters, pointing to the inclusion of relative unknowns Vicente
Egongo from Mallorca, Antonio ``Ito'' Perez from Betis, and Bittor
Alkiza from Athletic de Bilbao.
	   After Camacho's shakeup, the national squad is most influenced
by players from Real Madrid, Atletico de Madrid and Athletic de
Bilbao all of which have three representatives. FC Barcelona is
left with only two.

Thomas wins 400 for Wales; Oakes makes it six medals in six Games
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Iwan Thomas left his Welsh
teammate Jamie Baulch trailing in fourth and charged to the
Commonwealth Games 400-meter gold medal in a games record Friday to
add the title to last month's European Championship triumph.
	   The tall fair-haired Welshman, who had shared a good-natured
exchange of words, tongue pulling and arm gestures with Baulch in
the final stages of the semifinal, turned on the power with 80
meters to go to take the title in 44.52 seconds.
	   England's Mark Richardson took the silver in 44.60 and Sugath
Thilakaratne of Sri Lanka caught the fading Baulch to take the
bronze in 44.64. Thomas' time bettered the 44.60 of Australia's
Darren Clark, set eight years ago at Auckland, and his latest
triumph came a week after he also won the 400-meter title at the
World Cup in Johannesburg.
	   Baulch flopped on the track after his loss and was later helped
up by his Welsh teammate. As the two left the track arm in arm, the
emotional Baulch held Thomas' arm aloft as if to say ``he's the
winner.''
	   Thomas was dismayed that his colleague didn't win a medal.
	   ``He's one of my closest friends and I'm very disappointed. I
find it hard to celebrate really,'' he said.
	   The Welshman admitted, however, that he might raise a glass over
his latest triumph before preparing for the relay.
	   ``I'll limit myself to 20 beers tonight so I can be fresh for
Sunday,'' he said.
	   Flashing a new golden wave in her dark hair, defending champion
Judy Oakes gained a medal for the sixth Commonwealth Games in a
row, winning her third gold.
	   The 40-year-old English athlete heaved 18.83 meters with her
first throw in the shot put to virtually put herself out of reach
of the other seven competitors. Second-place Myrtle Augee made it
an English 1-2 but was 1.67 meters short of Oakes' effort. South
Africa's Johanna Abrahamse captured the bronze with a best of
16.52.
	   Friday's triumph makes it three golds, two silvers and a bronze
since Oakes made her games debut at Edmonton in 1978. She won a
bronze there, gold in Brisbane in '82, silver at Edinburgh in '86
and Auckland '90 and gold at Victoria, British Columbia four years
ago. She is the only track and field athlete to win a medal at six
games in a row.
	   ``I just wanted it very badly,'' she said. ``This is my last
Commonwealths. I didn't want to go out with a loss so it was very
important for me to win today and I think that's what gave me the
edge.
	   ``I'm not a spring chicken any more so I'm delighted to win.''
	   Bronze medalist four years ago and world championship runner-up
in 1997, Sandie Richards of Jamaica finally collected gold in the
400 meters. A former world indoor titlist, she clocked a games
record 50.17 seconds to run clear of Scotland's Alison Curbishley,
50.71, and England's Donna Fraser, 51.01.
	   Onichie Achike gained another gold for England with a games
record in the triple jump while Stuart Rendell captured Australia's
third hammer title in a row, and Andrea Blackett of Barbados also
set a games mark to win the women's 400-meter hurdles.
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards not at the Games
because of a foot operation, Achike and Julian Golley were
England's big hopes in the triple jump.
	   Achike opened with a leap of 16.98 to take the lead and came up
with his record 17.10 in round four. His four other attempts were
no jumps. Andrew Owusu of Ghana collected silver with 17.03, Remmy
Limo gained the bronze with 16.89 and Golley, who was favored to
win in Edwards' absence, failed to medal in fourth with 16.83.
	   In the 400 hurdles, Blackett clocked 53.91 seconds, pulling away
from England's Gowry Retchakan-Hodge, who clocked 55.25, and
Karlene Houghton of Canada, who had 55.53. Her time beat the 54.51
run by former Olympic champion Sally Gunnell at Victoria four years
ago.
	   Rendell threw 74.71 meters to capture Australia's second hammer
gold following Debbie Sosimenko's victory in the women's event.
	   England's Michael Jones placed second with 74.02 and South
Africa's Chris Harmse took the bronze with a best heave of 72.83.
Rendell, who succeeds two-time winner Sean Carlin, had the best
three throws of the final.
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas, who triumphed in Thursday's
100-meter final, pulled out of the 200 heats Friday. Fastest
qualifier for Saturday's semifinal was Australia's Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor, returning to action after a knee injury.
	   The fastest qualifier for Saturday's women's 800-meter final was
from Mozambique and it wasn't former world champion Maria Mutola.
	   Argentina Paulino clocked 2 minutes, 0.11 seconds to win the
first semifinal and Mutola's time in the second after a slowly run
race was 2:02.84. Mutola, the three-time world indoor titlist, was
followed home by Diane Modahl, the English runner who won the 1990
Games title and was prevented from defending it in '94 by a drugs
ban that was later quashed.
	   Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng, runner-up at the Games
four years ago, cruised into the men's 800 final although Kenya's
Japhet Kimutai was fastest qualifier with 1:46.88.

Serbs protest in front of German, US embassies

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb nationalists gathered outside
the German and American embassies Friday, denouncing what they see
as Western support for Albanian rebels fighting for independence of
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Shouting ``Gerries, get out'' and ``Kinkel is Hitler,'' up to
1,500 people protested in front of the German embassy in downtown
Belgrade, before proceeding to the U.S. embassy. There, they called
on President Clinton to resign and screamed out slanderous names.
	   About thirty policeman secured the rally, but no violence
erupted.
	   The protest came a day after Yugoslav officials accused Germany
of planning ``genocide'' against Serbs, after German Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe said on German television Tuesday that NATO
could strike ``in three to five weeks.''
	   On Friday, Germany rejected the Yugoslav charges that it
supports ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and was preparing a military
attack.
	   ``We view this as a cheap propaganda show,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said in Bonn. ``The implication that
Germany is acting alone or as the initiator is nonsense. It's a
conscious deception of the Yugoslav public.''

Poachers kill two rare mountain gorillas in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Poachers accidentally shot dead two rare
mountain gorillas in eastern Congo early this month, the African
Wildlife Foundation said Friday.
	   The gorillas _ a juvenile male named Birori and a 3-year-old
female _ were killed Sept. 3 in Virunga National Park, the oldest
wildlife sanctuary in Africa established in 1925.
	   ``The deaths of these young mountain gorillas represent a
devastating setback in our fight against extinction,'' said Michael
Wright, AFW president in a statement.
	   ``It is only through the dedication of park guards that other
gorillas are protected from a similar fate during this period of
intense conflict,'' Wright said.
	   A rebellion against the government of President Laurent Kabila
broke out Aug. 2 in the area near the park, and sporadic fighting
continues.
	   Slightly more than 600 of the rare gorillas are to be found in
the heavily forested range of inactive and active volcanoes that
forms the border with Congo, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   The statement said the poachers were hunting monkeys for food
when they shot the gorillas.
	   ``When they poachers discovered they had actually shot gorillas,
they fled the scene,'' the statement said.
	   The statement said many rangers have not been paid this year
because of fighting in the region, but they still continue patrols.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank said Friday it planned to print
rubles as part of a plan to aid the troubled banking system, but
the news did nothing to aid the currency, which again plummeted.
	   Newly confirmed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov meanwhile said
his government's goal would be to restore confidence that Russia
could meet its debt obligations and to stabilize the exchange rate
between the ruble and the U.S. dollar. He stressed that the
government would achieve these goals by applying economic, not
administrative, measures.
	   Primakov told reporters that the previous government's
announcement that it would default on debts had struck ``a heavy
blow against the country's prestige,'' and that his
government-in-formation was already beginning to work to restore
confidence.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Solidarity founder and former president,
Lech Walesa on Friday launched his new party's campaign for the
Oct. 11 local elections saying he wants it to run for parliament
after the year 2000.
	   Walesa was addressing some 500 members of the Christian
Democracy of Poland gathered for the party's first nationwide
congress. He founded the party a year ago hoping to draw support
from those Poles who are reluctant to cast their ballots.
	   Only 48 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in Polish
parliamentary elections last fall.
	   ``The aim of the Christian Democracy is to take part in
parliamentary elections in the new century,'' said Walesa who seems
uncomfortable with the retirement from top politics after his
defeat by ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski in the 1995
presidential elections.
	   He said the campaign for the Oct. 11 elections to three levels
of local governments will be a ``testing ground'' for his people
and program.
	   The party hopes to fill the gap on the rightist side of the
political scene when the ruling Solidarity Electoral Action party
``burns itself out'' wielding power and introducing difficult
social and administrative reforms, Walesa said.
	   His support for the Solidarity party helped it win parliamentary
elections and form a coalition government with the Freedom Union,
also Solidarity-rooted, last year.
	   In June, Walesa said he would considering running for president
in 2000 if no one else appears capable of beating ex-communist
Kwasniewski.

IRA prisoners cash in over jail breakout bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Crime paid for hundreds of
imprisoned Irish Republican Army members, who received cash awards
after guards found their escape tunnel, the British government
acknowledged Friday.
	   Prison guards in March discovered the elaborate tunnel leading
from one of the IRA-occupied blocks of the Maze prison southwest of
Belfast. More than 200 IRA prisoners filed claims of lost or
damaged property in the subsequent cell-by-cell search for weapons
and escape gear.
	   The Northern Ireland Prison Service confirmed that the
government had paid the inmates about 76,000 pounds (dlrs 128,000)
for their uncontested claims.
	   Most of those same inmates are being paroled early because of
April's peace agreement. On Friday five prisoners serving life
sentences for murder _ one IRA member and four from outlawed
pro-British groups _ walked free from the Maze.
	   Peter Robinson, deputy leader of Northern Ireland's most
hard-line pro-British Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists,
revealed the payments after being shown confidential documents by a
prison official.
	   Robinson condemned the cash awards as obscene, and contrasted it
with little compensation paid to many IRA victims.
	   Robinson said IRA member Sean Kelly _ convicted of a 1993
bombing that killed nine Protestant civilians and his IRA colleague
_ was among those IRA prisoners who got cash payments over 1,000
pounds (dlrs 1,700).
	   One of Kelly's victims, Michelle Williamson, a young woman whose
parents died the blast, received nothing from the government's
Compensation Agency.
	   ``When a terrorist is given more compensation for losing some of
his craft and contraband than a victim does for losing her mother
and father, it is time for decent people to speak up,'' said
Robinson, whose party opposed the peace agreement on the grounds it
rewarded terrorism.
	   The Protestant militants paroled Friday were Mark Trotter and
Robert Kenny, off-duty British soldiers who killed a Catholic man
in Enniskillen in 1985; another off-duty soldier Geoffrey Edwards,
who fatally shot a worker for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in
1985; and Thomas Mair, who killed a Catholic man in north Belfast
in 1984.
	   The IRA man freed was Damien Nicell, convicted for helping kill
a policeman in Londonderry in 1988.
	   So far 24 of more than 420 eligible prisoners have been paroled.
They all are supposed to be released by mid-2000.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks turned mixed on Wall Street Friday,
giving up broad early gains, as Thursday's global selloff was being
extended in Europe. Most Asian markets closed with losses, but
Tokyo's main stock index managed a small rebound from Thursday's
12-year low.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 56.90 in the
early going, was down 27.03 at 7,846.74 by midmorning. Broader
indicators were narrowly mixed in heavy trading.
	   The Dow remained below where it began the year, at 7,908.25, and
was almost 16 percent beneath its July 17 record high of 9,337.97.

EU, South Africa fail to clinch trade deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Negotiations between the European Union
and South Africa aimed at clinching a free trade agreement this
week failed, a South African official said Friday.
	   ``We encountered some real difficulties,'' the official, who
demanded anonymity, said at the end of the 21st round of trade
talks.
	   He declined to provide details.
	   Earlier this week, officials from both sides had expressed
optimism that they could achieve a breakthrough, although several
core issues remained to be settled. Notably, the 15-nation EU and
South Africa still have to work out the scope and timing of tariff
reductions on a range of industrial and agricultural goods.
	   An agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of bilateral trade,
worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19 million).
The deal would have to be approved by all 15 member states.

Trappers hunt several hundred minks still on the run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ONNELEY, England (AP) _ Trappers scurried on Friday to round up
an estimated several hundred minks still loose after animal rights
protesters freed thousands from a breeding farm.
	   Since the break-in early Thursday, Len Kelsall, who owns the
farm in Onneley, Staffordshire, 250 miles (400 kms) northwest of
London, discovered two of his vehicles had been vandalized. A car
and a van were at some point covered with a ``corrosive
substance,'' local police said.
	   The Animal Liberation Front, a shadowy extremist group linked to
similar actions, has claimed responsibility for the raid.
	   About 7,000 minks, which are known as vicious predators, were
released, but fewer than 1,000 escaped from the farm compound. Many
were later found run over or shot, and the ones still free posed a
threat to wildlife and domestic pets.
	   ``It is still horrendous out there, it looks like a battle
field,'' said Kelsall, 60, chairman of the National Fur Breeders
Association. ``It is just starting to hit me now how bad this is.''
	   The raid was the second time British activists have struck the
fur industry in as many months.
	   In August, supporters of the Animal Liberation Front smashed
cages and cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms)
southwest of London, freeing 2,000 minks _ some of which are still
running wild.
	   Kelsall blamed the British government for inciting the break-in
by promising legislation to end mink farming.

Spanish government rules out matching cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain will not declare a truce in response
to the Basque separatists' cease-fire, which took effect Friday,
the Spanish security chief said.
	   The militant separatist group ETA yielded to pressure ahead of
Oct. 25 elections in the Basque region and declared a halt to its
bloody 30-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland in
northern Spain.
	   But the Spanish government sought to temper expectations of a
permanent end to the violence.
	   ``The state can never declare a truce against a terrorist
group,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said Friday in an
interview broadcast on a local TV channel.
	   ETA gunmen and bombs have killed nearly 800 people since the
group began fighting in the late 1960s for an independent Basque
homeland straddling the border between Spain and France.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.
	   During his television interview, Mayor said ETA might be buying
time to rebuild its strength, and that the security forces will
determine whether the separatists were reorganizing over the border
in France.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, expressed skepticism about the
sincerity of ETA's declaration during a visit to Lima, Peru. He
demanded Thursday that the separatist group prove its commitment to
peace ``with actions and not declarations.''
	   ``We will begin to measure the sincerity of the cease-fire from
October 25th,'' Mayor said in the Antena 3 television interview. He
said that by then it would be clear whether the truce had been a
mere campaign tactic in support of Basque nationalist candidates in
the election.
	   The government claims that armed group is suffering from a
series of police successes against its commandos and financing
network. The entire leadership of the ETA-allied Basque party Herri
Batasuna was imprisoned last year, convicted of collaborating with
terrorism. And the Basque newspaper Egin was closed in July for
allegedly acting as a front for the separatists.
	   The government is seeking credit for forcing the truce and wants
to appear that it will give the cease-fire a chance to lead to
peace.
	   The four-page cease-fire declaration by ETA said the move was
motivated by a new political context favorable to the formation of
a pro-independence political front in the Basque region.
	   The cease-fire has been greeted with optimism in the northern
region, particularly from Basque nationalist leaders. Basque
nationalists, who support ETA's goal but reject the use of
violence, claim much of the credit for pressuring ETA into
declaring the truce.
	   In a more conciliatory interview Friday on a Basque radio
station, the interior minister said the government viewed the
elections as a potential guide of Basque public opinion on the
cease-fire, as well as a test of its sincerity.
	   ``The result is very important to determine in which direction
we go,'' Mayor said on Radio Euskadi.
	   An editorial Friday in leading daily El Pais also urged
prudence, but said that ``caution should not be taken to the
extreme ... . There are new opportunities now that never existed
before.''

Hoddle job intact, extension a possibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates. Adds quotes from F.A.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle emerged from a
meeting with the Football Association's international committee
Friday with his job intact.
	   Hoddle presented his France 98 World Cup report to the committee
but was not called to task, as expected, on his controversial World
Cup diary or his links with faith healer Eileen Drewery.
	   After the meeting, international committee chairman Noel White
said Hoddle had a majority backing of the committee.
	   Another committee was formed to consider a two-year contract
extension for Hoddle, F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly said.
	   He has two years remaining on a four-year contract, which will
take him through to the end of the Euro 2000 campaign. The new
contract will encompass the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South
Korea.
	   Before Friday's meeting, Kelly said ``obvious pressure points in
Hoddle's stewardship'' would be debated.
	   He later said that although certain officials had views about
Hoddle's book and his use of Drewery in team preparations, the
issues did not come onto the agenda.
	   ``(the sub-committee) will receive those views and deal with
them,'' he said.
	   ``I'm sure there are concerns in so far as the book is
concerned, albeit there were no confidences breached, and about Mrs
Drewery. These will be addressed in the talks which are going
ahead.''
	   Hoddle's tenure as coach has become increasingly uncertain after
a Euro qualifier loss to Sweden and public backlash over his World
Cup diary and links with Drewery.
	   His position was strong after a 10-man England team bowed out to
Argentina in a penalty shootout in the World Cup but his image was
tarnished when excerpts of his World Cup diary were published in a
national tabloid.
	   Hoddle was accused of betraying the trust of players in the
diary and later of improper business links with Drewery.
	   He has recently been linked with a move to his old club,
Tottenham, to replace Christian Gross as manager.
	   Although, Hoddle has rejected calls for his resignation and said
he would consider a contract extension.
	   ``...you get criticised in the job. I've been criticised in the
past and it'll happen in the future no doubt. The bottom line is
that we've got to respond,'' he said after the 2-1 loss to Sweden.

Central Bank lifts administration of largest private savings bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Central Bank on Friday lifted its
forced administration of SBS-Agro, the country's largest private
savings bank, Central Bank and SBS-Agro officials said.
	   The Central Bank announced it was taking over management of
SBS-Agro on Sept. 10 after it failed in late August to limit the
bank's business by ordering its branches to close for two weeks.
However, its auditors never managed to get through the door.
	   The Central Bank steps were aimed at preventing a massive run on
the bank, which had been hit by losses on the Russian and
international debt markets. There were also allegations that the
bank was stripping its assets _ accusations the bank strenuously
denied.
	   SBS-Agro spokesman Sergei Mesheryakov said that the bank would
start serving its business customers again on Monday.
	   ``The main attention will be paid to payment transactions by
corporate entities, because any continuation of the blockade of
mutual payments between enterprises and organizations would put the
nation's economy in a catastrophic condition,'' said a statement
issued by the bank.
	   SBS-Agro's individual depositors won't be able to access their
accounts despite the lifting of the forced administration,
Mesheryakov said.
	   ``We'll have to wait until the issues about the government's
deposit insurance are sorted out,'' he said.
	   SBS-Agro holds about 8 billion rubles (dlrs 500 million) of
personal deposits, of which less than 25 percent is denominated in
dollars, the bank's Deputy Director Andrei Likov said recently.
	   SBS-Agro, along with several other Russian commercial banks,
agreed earlier with the Central Bank to offer depositors the chance
to transfer their savings to the state-controlled savings bank,
where savings are guaranteed by the government.
	   The banks have until Sept. 26 to complete lists of depositors
who want to transfer their deposits to the savings bank.
Mesheryakov said about 10 percent to 12 percent of SBS-Agro
customers had agreed to the transfer.
	   The bank has 5.7 million depositors and 1.5 million commercial
customers.

just coming into the World Group has advance all the way to play
for the title.
	   The Swiss rest their hopes on a pair of teens, the top-ranked
Hingis, 17, and 19-year-old Patty Schnyder, who has five career WTA
Tour singles titles, all this season.
	   ``My first impression is positive,'' Swiss team captain and
Hingis' mother Melanie Molitor said. ``Martina and Patty seem
comfortable on this court.
	   ``But against Spain it's 50-50. The four in the final are all
ranked in the top 10. And today the difference between them is
minimal.''
	   Spain has reached the finals seven times in the last eight years
and is comprised of two veterans: fourth-ranked Aranxta Sanchez
Vicario and No. 7 Conchita Martinez.
	   The best-of-five final starts Saturday with Schnyder opening
against Sanchez Vicario and Hingis taking on Martinez.
	   The duos pair together for Sunday's doubles with reverse singles
to follow.
	   Figuring in all four Spanish Fed Cup titles in 1991, 1993, 1994
and 1995, the Spanish veterans will weild considerable
psychological artillery.
	   The pair displayed their perserverance in their semifinal tie
against the United States in July when they battled into the night
to beat Lisa Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez in doubles before
finally prevailing 6-4, 6-7, 11-9.
	   Switzerland, on the other hand, will benefit from the choice of
surfaces _ choosing the fast Greenset indoor carpet _ and the
support of a 12,000-strong soldout crowd.
	   With her number of tournament victories dropping from 12 in 1997
to four this season, and the loss of her U.S. Open and Wimbledon
titles, Hingis is anxious to end a mostly disappointing year with a
smile.
	   The winner of four Grand Slams titles, Hingis' lead atop the WTA
rankings has slipped. She has watched as U.S. Open champion Lindsay
Davenport, who beat her Sunday in the American championship final,
has moved dangerously closer to the No. 1 spot.
	   Hingis hasn't won a tournament since May, but has won won her
last 11 matches against Sanchez Vicario and Martinez over the past
two years.
	   Having a better season, but less tested, is Schnyder, who has
risen from 26th to ninth in the WTA Tour rankings since January.
	   With titles in Hobart, Hannover, Madrid, Maria Lankowitz and
Palermo, Schnyder has a match record of 52 and 14 this year.
	   This is the first time for Switzerland in the Fed Cup's World
Group since 1994, yet Hingis and Schnyder strolled rather easily
into the final.
	   They routed the Czech Republic 4-1 in Brno for their place in
the semifinals against France, then swept aside the defending
champion 5-0.
	   In contrast, Spain's journey was much more labored, edging past
Germany 3-2 before struggling against the Americans.
	   ``Just getting to the final is a big success for us,'' said
Hingis, who flew the Concorde to Zurich from New York on Monday
after winning the U.S. Open doubles final with Jana Novotna. ``It
doesn't happen everyday.''
	   But Hingis unlikely will be satisfied with just getting to the
final.
	   A landmark title would satisfy the teen-ager's sense of duty,
and allow Hingis to slip out of Fed Cup competition next year.
	   Many players find the three weeks of Fed Cup play difficult to
squeeze into an already long, packed season, and Hingis has hinted
it might not fit into her schedule next year
	   ``It'll all depend on the weekend's outcome,'' Hingis said.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Heading into national elections, Swedes
are trying to decide where their famed Middle Way is leading:
toward success or to the verge of failure.
	   After a discouraging decade in which the country suffered from
high unemployment and the fabric of its tightly knit social
services network began to unravel, the governing Social Democrats
say the worst is over and that the country's mix of socialism and
capitalism is back on track.
	   ``We need a few more years to restore the (social) welfare
system,'' Finance Minister Eric Aasbrink said Friday. But ``we
certainly cannot go to ... (what it was) 10 years ago, 30 years
ago.''
	   However, the conservative opposition, led by the Moderates party
of former prime minister Carl Bildt, says the worst is yet to come
unless Sweden abandons its high-tax ways.
	   Polls ahead of Sunday's elections show voters leaning toward the
status quo, but not with much conviction. A poll by the SIFO
organization published Friday in the national newspaper Svenska
Dagbladet showed the Social Democrats attracting the most support
at 36.8 percent _ far short of enough to govern alone. The
Moderates were at 24.8 percent.
	   Throughout the campaign, the graphs of support levels for the
two major parties have remained nearly flat, while five smaller
parties likely to win some of the 349 seats in the Riksdag
parliament have soared or plunged.
	   The two parties at the far ends of the ideological spectrum are
surging. The Left Party, the former Communists, have nearly doubled
their current support to 11.8 percent, according to Friday's poll,
while the Christian Democrats are at 10.1 percent, a 150-percent
jump from their support in the last elections in 1994.
	   Two other non-socialist parties gathered a total of 9.7 percent
and the Greens, likely to support the Social Democrats in a new
government, polled 4.7 percent.
	   A government of the Social Democrats with support from the Left
and Greens would likely continue the policies that, according to
the OECD, make Sweden the world's most heavily taxed country: in
1997, the tax burden was more than 53 percent of gross domestic
product.
	   The high taxes support Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare benefits
and social services, but they are discouraging to businesses.
Several major Swedish companies, including telecommunications giant
LM Ericsson, the country's largest company, have threatened to move
their headquarters out of Sweden unless the business climate
improves.
	   The Swedish economy is reasonably healthy. Unemployment is at
7.3 percent, but has been falling for the past two years as Sweden
digs out of the economic crisis of the early 1990s, inflation is
virtually nil, and Aasbrink said the country foresees a budget
surplus of about 2 percent this year.
	   But the Moderates say continuing the high taxes condemns Sweden
to being marginalized in an increasingly competitive global
economy. They propose a tax cut of 80 billion kronor (dlrs 10
billion) over three years. That would still keep Sweden's tax
burden extraordinarily high _ about 50 percent of GDP _ but would
stimulate job creation, Bildt contends.
	   Bildt has repeatedly lambasted the Social Democrats as holding
on to outmoded ideas and the contention has struck a chord with the
young. Pollster Toivo Sjoeren of SIFO said support for the
Moderates among first-time voters is about 40 percent.
	   But the party's relatively low support overall reflects many
Swedes' resistance to allowing the cold realities of the
marketplace more power in shaping their country.
	   ``We think that solidarity is modern, and egoism is
old-fashioned,'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson characterized the
issue in a television debate this week.
	   But Sweden's taxes and the regulations that are often obstacles
to small businessmen can also be alienating to many.
	   ``The government should pay more attention to projects like
this,'' said Miguel Montoya, proprietor of an outdoor jewelry stall
on a main Stockholm square. ``I had been unemployed ... Now I feel
myself part of things.''
	   Another sign of widespread disaffection has appeared in the
pre-voting polls, where around 12 percent of the respondents have
said they are undecided _ about twice the level from previous
elections. ``They are tired, they feel frustrated,'' said analyst
Hans Alfredson of the TEMO polling organization.
	   A generally unexciting election campaign hasn't helped. Persson
and Bildt inspire little personal affection among voters. Persson
is regarded by many as being didactic and condescending, while
Bildt puts many off with his cerebral aura and sharp tongue.
	   There has been no issue that has caught fire. Bildt tried
unsuccessfully to make Sweden's hesitance to join the European
Union's single-currency program a linchpin of his contention that
Sweden has ``Europe's most pusillanimous government.''
	   But most parties from left to right either oppose the EMU or say
joining it should be put to a referendum, which surveys indicate
would fail.
	   A brief potential controversy emerged this week when Gudrun
Schyman, head of the high-tax Left Party, admitted she had failed
to report to the tax authorities some payments she made to a girl
who helped clean her house, but the issue lost steam quickly.
	   The election's failure to capture strong interest could be
gauged from the headlines in Stockholm's two afternoon newspapers
on Friday. In Expressen, the election was the day's top story,
while Aftobladet led with an investigation of which liquor store
has the fastest service.

Sun-probing satellite back in operation, scientists say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ European Space Agency scientists working with NASA
have managed to regain control of the sun-studying satellite SOHO,
after nearly three months of efforts, officials said.
	   On Wednesday, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ``obeyed
commands that turned its face fully toward the sun,'' said an ESA
statement. For the first time since SOHO spun out of control June
25, ``it points the right way.''
	   ``This is the best news we have had from SOHO in a long time,''
George Withbroe, director of the Sun-Earth Connection program at
NASA in Washington, D.C., said in the statement Thursday.
	   ESA's project scientist for the dlrs 1 billion satellite,
Bernhard Fleck, said scientists will now check all the spacecraft's
systems and instruments.
	   Despite the instruments' exposure to extreme heat and cold,
``I'm cautiously optimistic that SOHO can win back much of its
scientific capacity for observing the sun,'' he said.
	   The craft, about 1.6 million kilometers (one million miles) out
in space, had been spinning at the rate of about one revolution per
minute. This motion prevented the craft's solar panels from
generating electrical power. The reason for the spin-out remained
unknown.
	   Lack of power allowed the satellite's fuel tanks to freeze,
preventing the craft from repositioning itself.
	   But SOHO's angle to the sun gradually changed and the craft was
able to slowly recharge its batteries to the point it could
communicate with scientists and resume operation.
	   SOHO, a joint U.S.-European project, had already completed its
primary mission when it experienced the problems. The craft was
launched Dec. 2, 1995 and was designed for a two-year operational
lifetime.
	   NASA and ESA scientists hoped to extend the SOHO research during
the period that the sun goes through a cycle of maximum solar
activity that peaks in 2001.
	   SOHO already has provided fundamental new understanding about
the interior of the sun and about the corona, the envelope of
superheated gas that surround the sun.

Romanian journalist receives second libel sentence this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A journalist was sentenced to pay 15
million lei (dlrs 1,667) damages after he was convicted of libeling
a police colonel, according to a statement released Friday by the
Monitorul de Iasi newspaper.
	   Dragos Stangu, 30, wrote four articles for the newspaper in
January describing a conflict at the Iasi police academy between
the students and Col. Adrian Leik, the academy's deputy dean.
	   In January, 120 students sent a memorandum to Interior Minister
Gavril Dejeu complaining of Leik's ``dictatorial behavior.''
	   Leik sued Stangu for libel in April, and the journalist was
found guilty and sentenced Tuesday. An appeal is pending.
	   This is Stangu's second libel conviction this year. In August,
Stangu and journalist Ovidiu Scultelnicu, 31, were each sentenced
to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages equal to dlrs
170,000. They remain free as the case is appealed.
	   In May, the two published an article disclosing details of a
meeting of police chiefs in which a police colonel was accused of
amassing wealth of uncertain origin and of ignoring complaints
filed by residents in Iasi, some 325 kilometers (203 miles)
northeast of Bucharest.
	   In post-communist Romania, officials are unaccustomed to
criticism in the free-wheeling press.
	   Justice officials are often suspected of being corrupt. They are
accused of delaying some cases for years while rushing through
others in which they have a vested interest.

Ukrainian parliament asks president to abolish budget cuts decree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's opposition-dominated parliament
asked President Leonid Kuchma on Friday to abolish his decree
ordering spending cuts to bring down this year's budget deficit.
	   The Verkhovna Rada voted 259-28 in favor of a non-binding
resolution calling on Kuchma to annul the August measure. It also
ordered the government to provide a draft law on 1998 budget
changes to parliament.
	   The majority leftist and centrist opposition in parliament
threatened to take up the issue of Kuchma overstepping his
authority if he fails to obey.
	   Kuchma indicated this week that he would not avert his step,
taken to fulfill a key demand by the International Monetary Fund
before the fund's recent approval of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan for
Ukraine.
	   The decree ordered spending to be slashed by up to 20 percent
with the goal of bringing the budget deficit down from 3.3 percent
to 2.5 percent of Ukraine's gross domestic product, in line with
the IMF requirements.
	   The document, issued after parliament failed to discuss the
budget, did not affect funds earmarked for paying wages, pensions
and social welfare subsidies.
	   The parliamentary resolution Friday was the latest example of
the tensions between Kuchma's government and parliament. The
conflict gathered force this week after the Verkhovna Rada overrode
Kuchma's veto and confirmed its earlier law banning an increase in
communal payments.
	   Kuchma's Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin, in an
interview published Friday, called for unity of the executive and
legislative branches and said a conflict between them could be the
largest threat to the nation's security.
	   Such a conflict has aggravated Russia's financial crisis, a
scenario that Ukraine must avoid, Horbulin told the daily Fakty.

Pakistan vows to stay neutral if Iran attacks Afghanistan

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan promised Friday to stay out
of a possible military conflict between Iran and Afghanistan and
warned that war between those neighbors would have a regional
impact that must be avoided.
	   Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan, which is allied with
the Taliban army that rules most of Afghanistan, would remain
neutral even if Iran launches a military strike in retaliation for
the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
	   ``It is most important to defuse the prevailing tension that has
been created by the massing of Iranian troops along the Afghan
border. A conflict would have a devastating effect on the peace and
stability of the entire region,'' Aziz told a news conference.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the military
on full alert Tuesday as the public and newspapers demanded revenge
for Iranian deaths during the Taliban's assault on the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif on August 8.
	   Mullah Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, urged a peaceful
settlement in a statement issued Friday in the Afghan city of
Kandahar.
	   ``The only solution is dialogue under international principles.
The problems of Afghanistan will not be solved by military or other
pressure,'' Omar said.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Wednesday warned that
Iranian patience was reaching its limit over demands for an apology
from the Taliban, the extradition of the diplomats' killers and the
return of all Iranians held captive in Afghanistan.
	   While the Taliban army has said it is ready to talk peace, it
also has warned it is ready to repel any invasion with a powerful
arsenal that includes Scud missiles.
	   Pakistan's Aziz dashed to Tehran on Thursday with a letter from
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the Iranian president in a bid to
ease tensions between Iran and Afghanistan.
	   Aziz urged the international community to demand restraint by
Iran and the Taliban, and called on the United Nations to step up
its own efforts to defuse tension.
	   ``I told the Iranian leaders that we are ready to work closely
with them at the U.N. and the OIC (Organization of Islamic
Countries) or any other forum to resolve the present crisis,'' Aziz
said.
	   The Taliban released five Iranian prisoners in a goodwill
gesture earlier this month, and promised to release another five on
Saturday, he said.
	   Aziz said the United Nations will send a mission to Afghanistan
to investigate allegations of mass killings by the Taliban in
Bamiyan province.
	   Iran and the anti-Taliban alliance accuse Pakistan's army of
supporting the Taliban, helping in a recent string of victories
against Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance. Aziz
denied official Pakistani involvement.
	   The Taliban say Iran has been arming and training Afghanistan's
opposition alliance.

Ukraine intends to cooperate with NASA despite booster failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine intends to sign a five-year space
cooperation agreement with the U.S. space agency despite the recent
failure of a Ukrainian booster carrying 12 American commercial
satellites.
	   Oleksandr Negoda, director of Ukraine's National Space Agency,
said Friday that the agreement would be signed when NASA experts
visit Ukraine in October-November this year.
	   Negoda also argued that Ukrainian rockets remained quite
reliable and that the number of their failures since 1991 has been
relatively low, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``We have to pay our debts to complex space technologies,''
Negoda said in reference to last week's failure of the Zenit-2
booster, adding that Ukraine is ``finding full understanding in
this issue'' among its space partners.
	   The control system of the rocket, launched by Russia's space
agency on Sept. 10, failed during the 5th minute of flight,
shutting down the engines. The Zenit was carrying 12 Globalstar
satellites, meant to be used as part of a dlrs 2.6 billion, global
hand-held mobile satellite phone system.
	   A commission investigating the Zenit crash was to meet this week
at the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, home to the huge Yuzhmash
plant and the Yuzhne construction bureau, the rocket's main
manufacturers and designers.
	   Negoda said the team would complete its investigation by the end
of the month. The probe is complicated, however, as the booster's
Ukrainian-designed computer reportedly was manufactured in Moscow.

Bohn extends lead to 292 pins in Japan Cup bowling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Parker Bohn III shot two 300 games as he went
14-1-1 in rounds two and three Friday to lead the 14th annual
Oronamin C Japan Cup by 292 pins at Tokyo Port Bowl.
	   The four-day event, an invitational all match play tournament,
features the top 16 players each from the U.S. Professional Bowlers
Association and its Japanese counterpart.
	   Bohn, a 16-time PBA champion who leads the Tour this year with
three wins, rolled a 300 game on his way from seventh to the lead
in round two.
	   In round three in the evening, Bohn from Jackson, New Jersey won
seven of eight matches and shot another 300 game en route to a
three-round total pinfall of 6,588.
	   Bohn won this event in 1992.
	   First-time Japan Cup qualifier Brian Himmler made a big move,
going from seventh to second with the help of six wins in his eight
games in round three.
	   Himmler, of Cincinnati, Ohio, is seeking his first title and
checks in with 6,296 total pins.
	   Walter Ray Williams Jr. remained in the top five. The reigning
PBA Player of the Year from Orlando, Florida, is third, 10 pins
behind Himmler. Williams is after his third win of the year and
27th of his career.
	   Steve Jaros climbed into third place Friday morning, but fell
one spot after the third round. Jaros, a two-time PBA titlist from
Bolingbrook, Illinois has 6,252 total pins after winning six of
eight matches in the evening.
	   Tim Criss placed fifth with 6,212 total pins. The resident of
Bel Air, Maryland leads the Tour in points this year.
	   Tommy Delutz Jr. from Flushing, New York was in sixth with 6,177
total pins. He joins Himmler as the two first-time PBA qualifier
for this year's Japan Cup. He owns one of the four 300 games in the
current tournament.
	   Teruyuki Obara made the biggest move of the night as he jumped
from 19th to seventh with the help of a 6-2 match play record.
Obara is the highest JPBA member in the field of 32 with a total
pinfall of 6,146.
	   Defending champion Doug Kent, of Canandaigua, New York placed
ninth with 6,112 total pins.
	   The 32 bowlers compete Saturday in the final fourth round of
match play before the field is trimmed to the top six for Sunday's
championship round.
	   The 20 million yen (dlrs 150,000) event offers a top prize of 5
million yen (dlrs 37,600).

Reactor stopped at Ukraine's Zaporizhya nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was stopped Friday at Ukraine's
Zaporizhya nuclear power plant to allow for scheduled check-ups and
repairs of its turbine, officials said.
	   The repairs are small and are to last five days, said the state
nuclear energy company Energoatom. No radiation leaks were
reported.
	   Another reactor at Zaporizhya, Europe's largest nuclear power
plant, is presently undergoing repairs. The plant has five
Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.

Cuba says United States holds `world record' in spying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba accused the United States of waging a
``campaign'' against its communist government with its arrest of 10
alleged Cuban spies, and said America holds the ``world record'' in
spying.
	   ``In terms of spying, and especially in undermining the
political stability of other countries, there is none in this world
with a record like that of the United States, especially in the
case of Cuba,'' foreign ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said
Thursday in Havana.
	   He would neither confirm nor deny that the 10 people rounded up
last weekend in Florida and charged with spying on the United
States were indeed spies, but said Cuba is accustomed to that kind
of accusation from the United States.
	   ``For 40 years, they have organized all kinds of undercover and
open activities against the security, the stability and the
well-being of the Cuban people,'' he said.
	   ``We're used to all kind of campaigns from the United States,''
he said at a weekly news conference.
	   Cuban officials have said they were studying the arrests and
would have an official response sometime soon.
	   The 10 under arrest in Florida are charged with trying to
penetrate U.S. military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups
and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations. Prosecutors
say it is the biggest Cuban spy ring uncovered in the United States
since Castro took power in 1959.
	   The Pentagon says none of the alleged spies obtained U.S.
secrets.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's dubbers said just the words Friday that TV
and movie fans were waiting to hear: They were ending their
2-month-old strike.
	   The agreement ends a protest that has delayed the Italian
release of some Hollywood blockbusters and forced TV subtitles and
voice-overs on a public used to skillful dubbing.
	   The dubbers will go back to work Monday, bolstered by an accord
that gives them the collective contract that was their key demand,
they said. The accord was ratified by an overwhelming majority
among about 400 dubbing actors, directors and others Friday.
	   Italy's ANSA news agency said the deal guarantees the dubbers
will work no more than nine hours a day and get Saturdays and
Sundays off.

Clinton trip hinges on U.N. speeches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton's decision on whether
to travel to India and Pakistan in November will hinge on the tone
and substance of the speeches the prime ministers of the two
countries make next week to the U.N. General Assembly, officials
say.
	   Clinton's plans to travel to the two countries were thrown into
doubt when they carried out nuclear tests last May.
	   Concerned that the tests could pose a danger to peace in South
Asia, senior administration officials have held a series of
separate discussions with Indian and Pakistani officials, hoping to
persuade them to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to
take other conciliatory measures as well.
	   The outcome of these talks has been a tightly held secret.
	   In remarks to reporters at the White House Friday, Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said the administration's
series of discussions with the Indians and Pakistanis have
attempted to ``put them back on track'' with regard to nuclear
issue.
	   ``I think there has been some movement, but I think so far it's
been insufficient,'' Berger said. He said a decision on a Clinton
trip would be made ``in the next few weeks.''
	   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said a final
decision on whether Clinton should travel to South Asia had been
planned for last week but was put off. Instead, they decided to
await the speeches of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif.
	   During his brief stay in New York, Clinton plans to meet with
Sharif. No meeting with Vajpayee is planned because he will not be
in New York when Clinton is there, officials said.
	   India exploded a series of nuclear devices deep under its
western deserts in May, prompting tests by neighboring Pakistan,
with which India has fought three wars.
	   The tests put a crimp in an U.S. plan to give higher priority to
ties to the South Asian rivals.
	   The Clinton administration has made an intense effort to steer
India and Pakistan away from confrontation, encouraging them, among
other measures, to halt all further testing.

Zimbabwe's Stewart, Australia's Michell win diving golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Zimbabwe's Evan Stewart gained the
night's best score on his last dive Friday, overtaking Australia's
Dean Pullar for the gold medal on the men's one-meter springboard
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   It was Zimbabwe's first gold medal of these games.
	   Australian Chantelle Michell built her lead dive by dive in
winning the women's one-meter springboard gold.
	   Pullar led Stewart 320.460 to 303.060 after five of the six
final-round dives, but Stewart saved his most difficult dive for
last and gained 81.600 points. Pullar's last dive earned high
marks, but it was one of his easiest, and earned him just 61.200.
	   That left Stewart with the gold by a margin of 384.660 to
381.660. Australian Robert Newberry won the bronze with 369.150.
	   In the women's diving, World Championships bronze medalist
Michell won with 271.560. Canadians won the other two medals, with
Blythe Hartley second at 248.280 and Eryn Bulmer third at 239.400.
	   ``I think I'm a little bit more excited about this gold medal
than my bronze at the world titles because it's gold,'' Michell
said. ``But at Perth I was pretty ecstatic as well.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's top Albanian leader gave
his public backing Friday to a U.S.-sponsored plan denying his
people the independence they seek but offering them peace and local
autonomy in the Serbian province.
	   Endorsement of the plan by Ibrahim Rugova came amid news of
further battlefield losses by Albanian guerrillas to better armed
Serbian and Yugoslav forces.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said the Serb-Yugoslav alliance ended a
three-day offensive north of Pristina and moved to the Drenica
region southwest of the provincial capital, apparently to mop up
the last pocket of fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas have rejected any negotiated
settlement short of independence from Serbia. But they have been
marginalized after months of defeats by Serb police and the
Yugoslav army.
	   The U.S.-backed Rugova also favors independence but opposes
fighting for it. U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that
Rugova had in principle accepted the American plan, along with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But his public endorsement of the interim formula appeared
calculated to coincide with the latest crushing defeats of his
militant rivals.
	   Rugova called the draft a ``temporary solution,'' aimed at
``normalizing the difficult and risky situation ... halting attacks
and the use of force.''
	   On Thursday, some details of the three-year plan were published
in the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore. It would give Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo, the say over local affairs but
keep them part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia. Kosovo's autonomy
was revoked in 1989 by Milosevic.
	   Rugova's endorsement came amid a growing humanitarian crisis in
the province, with a new Serb-Yugoslav offensive north of Pristina
increasing the flood of Albanian civilians abandoning destroyed
villages.
	   In Geneva Friday, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said the offensive, which started
Wednesday, has prompted about 10,000 people to flee at least 13
villages in the region between Podujevo and Mitrovica in the north.
	   And all fleeing villagers told the same story _ word that they
would be attacked and shelling after they fled, said Janowski.
	   The offensive appeared over Friday, with ethnic Albanian sources
saying that army and police units were pulling out of the region.
	   Area residents in Kicic village told The Associated Press that
government forces killed at least 20 civilians and destroyed
virtually all the 500 houses in three villages just over a hill
where columns of smoke billowed Friday.
	   One Kicic resident offered to escort reporters to a house where,
he said, six civilians lie dead but sporadic machine-gun and small
arms fire from the area impeded access.
	   ``The Serbs came and they had so many tanks,'' said Rexhep
Mustafa, 54, whose brother, Halil, was shot to death Thursday.
	   ``Halil called for help, help for three minutes,'' said Mustafa,
tears welling in his eyes as he undressed his brothers' body for a
Muslim burial.
	   Residents said dozens of tanks, backed by heavy artillery, Serb
police and Yugoslav soldiers scattered secessionist guerrilla
forces in the last two days and obliterated area villages.
	   ``It's pretty calm now, the police just shelled and shelled and
left,'' said a 27-year-old resident of Kicic who identified himself
only as Ibrahim.
	   At least 10 tanks and armored personnel carriers with mounted
machine-guns were seen leaving the Kicic area early Friday.
	   One kilometer away, most of the hundred or so houses of
Smrekovnica village smoldered. Burnt-out cars, houses and
smoldering haystacks lined the main street but bullet and artillery
holes, or other signs of fighting, were not visible, lending
credence to Albanian claims that much of the damage was from arson.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, said Janowski, the UNHCR
spokesman. Many were reportedly sick or wounded.
	   More than 260,000 people _ most of them Albanian villagers _
have been made homeless by the fighting, including an estimated
50,000 refugees living in the mountains and forests.

Palestinians injured in clashes with Israeli troops; changes

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during the two-day
Jewish Near Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the
group's bombmakers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, the crowd stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement. Troops fired rubber
bullets, injuring 32 Palestinians, including one who was in serious
condition with a chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross told
Palestinian negotiators Friday he was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   During a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and his aides, Ross ``told us that he feels there will be
progress,'' said Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.
	   ``He said he feels deeply that both of us, Israelis and
Palestinians, had a desire to reach agreement, but that it is
difficult to specify progress,'' Shaath quoted Ross as saying.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving for Washington on Saturday to brief U.S. President
Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Despite Ross' somewhat upbeat remarks, there were no concrete
signs that the two sides were closer to agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and revised terms
of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed by Washington.
	   Also Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered a Jewish West Bank
settler held until Sunday, on suspicion he shot to death an
17-year-old Palestinian in the village of Beitunia on Thursday.
	   The settler, Avshalom Ladani from the Dolev settlement, had
turned himself in several hours after the shooting. Ladani had been
driving through Beitunia when the incident occured.
	   Ladani's lawyer, Yair Golan, said his client acted in
self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, and that he shot
only in the air.
	   However, Palestinians said Ladani opened fire unprovoked,
seriously wounding two Palestinian teen-age boys who were walking
home from school. One of the injured, Iyad Kabasma, died of his
wounds at Ramallah Hospital on Thursday afternoon, while a second
boy remained in stable condition.
	   Kabasma was buried Friday afternoon in the village of Ein Arik
near Beitunia, and hundreds of mourners chanted ``long live the
rifle.'' A wall slogan in the village signed by Arafat's Fatah
movement read, ``Shame to those who support co-existence with the
occupiers.''

Czechs see no successor to Havel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs have no idea who might be a
successor to Vaclav Havel although the country is evenly split over
whether the oft-ailing president should step down.
	   According to a poll released Friday by the Sofres-Factum agency,
almost two-thirds of the Czech population cannot imagine anybody
other than Havel as president.
	   ``The survey's results make it clear there is no personality who
would be perceived ... as a suitable successor to Vaclav Havel,''
the authors were quoted as saying.
	   The closest contender, parliament Speaker Vaclav Klaus, has the
support of 7 percent of the population and Premier Milos Zeman has
nearly 5 percent.
	   While Klaus is known to have presidential ambitions, Zeman has
repeatedly stated he will quit politics when his term expires in
four years.
	   According to the poll, 47 percent of those surveyed think Havel
should quit his job for health reasons, while 49 percent think he
should stay.
	   Havel, who spearheaded Czechoslovakia's anti-communist
revolution, became president in December 1989. After the
federation's breakup in 1993, he became Czech president and was
re-elected for his final five-year term Jan. 20.
	   At 61, the cancer-battling president no longer enjoys the
political power he once had, but is still seen as a father figure
in the post-communist era.
	   The agency surveyed 1,063 people at the end of August and
beginning of September. The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage
points.

Unbeatens take to the road
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Now that they've proven their prowess at home,
last year's American National Football League championship game
participants take to the road for the first time Sunday.
	   The Denver Broncos, perhaps without John Elway, are at their
archrivals, the Oakland Raiders. The Green Bay Packers, beaten in
last January's Super Bowl by the Broncos, head to Cincinnati.
	   Elway strained his hamstring in a 42-23 victory over Dallas last
weekend. He's listed as questionable.
	   ``You get ready for Elway. That's how you practice. You don't
get ready for Bubby Brister,'' Raiders cornerback Eric Allen said
referring to the Broncos' reserve quarterback. ``Bubby's a good
guy, but he's no John Elway. If Elway's not in the game, we have to
adjust then.''
	   Elway has thrown for 31 touchdowns and 5,593 yards in 26 career
games against the Raiders, who handed the Broncos their first loss
after a 6-0 start last year, a 28-25 victory in Oakland in which
running back Napoleon Kaufman ran for 227 yards.
	   ``You don't want to take a week off, especially the way we're
playing right now,'' Elway said.
	   The Broncos have picked up where they left off last postseason,
when they won three times away from Mile High Stadium and became
only the second wild card to win the Super Bowl. But they haven't
been out of Denver this season, beating New England and Dallas at
home.
	   Elway suffered a similar injury in 1996, tried to play through
the injury, but missed one game a month later.
	   ``The injuries are different,'' said Elway, 38. ``On the last
one, I was able to stay in and finish the game. That's the thing
that scares me about this one, the fact that I couldn't stay in.
But the last hamstring was torn and this one is not. So it's hard
to compare.''
	   The Packers also have injury problems, most notably in the
backfield, where Dorsey Levens is gone with a broken leg. They
would like to run against a Bengals defense that gave up 185 yards
to Barry Sanders last Sunday.
	   ``We don't think we'll run for 185 yards. We know we won't,''
Brett Favre said. ``But we've got to find a way to put our offense
in a situation where we're not in second- or third-and-long
situations.
	   ``Something we have to work on hard this week is running the
football. We've proven we can pass it. But if you can't run it,
eventually it's going to catch up to you.''
	   The Bengals, who often struggle early in the season, come off an
emotional overtime victory at Detroit to even their record.
	   ``I hope it gets everybody fired up,'' said Corey Sawyer, whose
interception runback for a touchdown clinched the game. ``If we
beat Green Bay, we'll be sitting high.''
	   Also Sunday, it's Detroit at Minnesota, Indianapolis at the New
York Jets, Pittsburgh at Miami, St. Louis at Buffalo, San Diego at
Kansas City, Tennessee at New England, Washington at Seattle,
Chicago at Tampa Bay, Baltimore at Jacksonville, and Philadelphia
at Arizona.
	   On Monday night, it's Dallas at the New York Giants. Atlanta,
Carolina, New Orleans and San Francisco have byes.
	   Pittsburgh also has two home victories as it heads to unbeaten
Miami in the only matchup of teams with spotless records. The
Steelers led the league in rushing last season and always are
formidable on the ground. The Dolphins are trying to emulate that.
	   ``The Steelers are very similar to us as far as their
approach,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said.
	   ``What Jimmy is attempting to do _ I give him a lot of credit,''
Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher said. ``You're taking a mentality of
throwing that they've had many years with Dan Marino, and now
they're establishing a running game that has been very
impressive.''
	   Miami is 11th in yards rushing, but only 28th in passing, a real
switch. Pittsburgh is ninth in rushing, which isn't so bad, QB
Kordell Stewart said.
	   ``We're 2-0,'' Stewart said. ``What more do you want?''

Swallows beat BayStars 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsuru Manaka cracked a winning single in the
bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Yakult Swallows a 3-2
victory Friday over the Central League's front-running Yokohama
BayStars.
	   Dwayne Hosey, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, hit a solo homer
in the fifth for the Swallows. He has 11 homers this season.
	   The BayStars have a three-game lead over the second-place
Chunichi Dragons, who were idle Friday.
	   At Koshien, the Hanshin Tigers had a late start. Makoto Imaoka
drove in two runs on a bases-loaded winning single in the bottom of
the eighth as the Tigers beat the Yomiuri Giants 6-4.
	   Tigers' starter Tetsuro Kawajiri (10-4) threw a seven hitter,
while striking out four and walking three in eight innings.
Reliever Ben Rivera, formerly with the Philadelphia Phillies,
allowed no hits and struck out two to collect his 24th save.
	   In the Pacific League, Toshihiro Noguchi belted a game-reversing
two-run homer in the bottom of the fourth inning, lifting the
first-place Nippon Ham Fighters to a 5-2 victory over the Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks at Tokyo Dome.
	   Nigel Wilson, formerly of the Cleveland Indians, drove in
another run on a sacrifice fly in the fifth.
	   At Chiba, Susumu Otomo and Taisei Takagi combined for two runs
on back-to-back singles in the seventh, lifting the Seibu Lions to
a 5-3 victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines.
	   The Lions rose to the league's second place and are just one
game behind the leader. The Dragons slipped to third and are half a
game behind.
	   Pinch hitter Rudy Pemberton, formerly of the Boston Red Sox,
arched a solo shot into the left stands in the eighth to widen the
lead.
	   At Osaka Dome, the Orix BlueWave kept their early lead for their
8-2 victory over the Kintetsu Buffaloes.
	   Chris Donnels, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, batted in the
first run for the BlueWave on a single in the top of the first
inning, followed by Yoshitomo Tani's two-run single.
	   Yasuo Fujii singled in the second to drive in two more runs.

Thomas wins 400 for Wales; Oakes makes it six medals in six Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with decathlon, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Iwan Thomas left his Welsh
teammate Jamie Baulch trailing in fourth and charged to the
Commonwealth Games 400-meter gold medal in a games record Friday to
add the title to last month's European Championship triumph.
	   The tall fair-haired Welshman, who had shared a good-natured
exchange of words, tongue pulling and arm gestures with Baulch in
the final stages of the semifinal, turned on the power with 80
meters to go to take the title in 44.52 seconds.
	   England's Mark Richardson took the silver in 44.60 and Sugath
Thilakaratne of Sri Lanka caught the fading Baulch to take the
bronze in 44.64. Thomas' time bettered the 44.60 of Australia's
Darren Clark, set eight years ago at Auckland, and his latest
triumph came a week after he also won the 400-meter title at the
World Cup in Johannesburg.
	   Baulch flopped on the track after his loss and was later helped
up by his Welsh teammate. As the two left the track arm in arm, the
emotional Baulch held Thomas' arm aloft as if to say ``he's the
winner.''
	   Thomas was dismayed that his colleague didn't win a medal.
	   ``He's one of my closest friends and I'm very disappointed. I
find it hard to celebrate really,'' he said.
	   The Welshman admitted, however, that he might raise a glass over
his latest triumph before preparing for the relay.
	   ``I'll limit myself to 20 beers tonight so I can be fresh for
Sunday,'' he said.
	   Flashing a new golden wave in her dark hair, defending champion
Judy Oakes gained a medal for the sixth Commonwealth Games in a
row, winning her third gold.
	   The 40-year-old English athlete heaved 18.83 meters with her
first throw in the shot put to virtually put herself out of reach
of the other seven competitors. Second-place Myrtle Augee made it
an English 1-2 but was 1.67 meters short of Oakes' effort. South
Africa's Johanna Abrahamse captured the bronze with a best of
16.52.
	   Friday's triumph makes it three golds, two silvers and a bronze
since Oakes made her games debut at Edmonton in 1978. She won a
bronze there, gold in Brisbane in '82, silver at Edinburgh in '86
and Auckland '90 and gold at Victoria, British Columbia four years
ago. She is the only track and field athlete to win a medal at six
games in a row.
	   ``I just wanted it very badly,'' she said. ``This is my last
Commonwealths. I didn't want to go out with a loss so it was very
important for me to win today and I think that's what gave me the
edge.
	   ``I'm not a spring chicken any more so I'm delighted to win.''
	   Bronze medalist four years ago and world championship runner-up
in 1997, Sandie Richards of Jamaica finally collected gold in the
400 meters. A former world indoor titlist, she clocked a games
record 50.17 seconds to run clear of Scotland's Alison Curbishley,
50.71, and England's Donna Fraser, 51.01.
	   Two-time defending champion Mike Smith of Canada was beaten by
two Australians in the decathlon, Jagan Hames totalling 8,490
points to beat countryman Scott Ferrier by 183 points. Smith, who
was well behind throughout the 10 disciplines, scored 8,143, well
short of his best of 8,626.
	   Hames triumph meant that Australia, which has dominated the
Games with 59 golds, has the most in the track stadium with five.
England has four.
	   Onichie Achike gained another gold for England with a games
record in the triple jump while Stuart Rendell captured Australia's
third hammer title in a row, and Andrea Blackett of Barbados also
set a games mark to win the women's 400-meter hurdles.
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards not at the Games
because of a foot operation, Achike and Julian Golley were
England's big hopes in the triple jump.
	   Achike opened with a leap of 16.98 to take the lead and came up
with his record 17.10 in round four. His four other attempts were
no jumps. Andrew Owusu of Ghana collected silver with 17.03, Remmy
Limo gained the bronze with 16.89 and Golley, who was favored to
win in Edwards' absence, failed to medal in fourth with 16.83.
	   In the 400 hurdles, Blackett clocked 53.91 seconds, pulling away
from England's Gowry Retchakan-Hodge, who clocked 55.25, and
Karlene Houghton of Canada, who had 55.53. Her time beat the 54.51
run by former Olympic champion Sally Gunnell at Victoria four years
ago.
	   Rendell threw 74.71 meters to capture Australia's second hammer
gold following Debbie Sosimenko's victory in the women's event.
	   England's Michael Jones placed second with 74.02 and South
Africa's Chris Harmse took the bronze with a best heave of 72.83.
Rendell, who succeeds two-time winner Sean Carlin, had the best
three throws of the final.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The first lineup announced by Spain's new
coach Jose Antonio Camacho Friday included seven changes from the
team that suffered a humiliating defeat against semiprofessional
Cyprus two weeks ago.
	   The exhibition match against Russia next Wednesday will be
Camacho's first as coach of the national side that was under Javier
Clemente's command.
	   Camacho replaced Clemente on Tuesday, with a mission to shine up
the squad's image tarnished by a disappointing World Cup
performance and corroded by the Cyprus defeat in a European
Championship qualifier.
	   Among the seven new call-ups only Jordi Lardin from Atletico de
Madrid has played for the national team before.
	   ``The midfield is going to be completely new,'' Camacho told
reporters, pointing to the inclusion of relative unknowns Vicente
Egongo from Mallorca, Antonio ``Ito'' Perez from Betis, and Bittor
Alkiza from Athletic de Bilbao.
	   Other newcomers are goalkeeper Antoni ``Toni'' Jimenez from
Espanyol, Francisco Jose De Pedro from Real Sociedad, Francisco
Jemez from Zaragoza.
	   Left out in the cold this time are FC Barcelona's Miguel Angel
Nadal and Abelardo Fernandez, as well as Alfonso Perez and Antonio
Prats from Betis, Agustin Aranzabal from Real Sociedad, Santiago
Ezquerro from Athletic de Bilbao and Guillermo Amor from the
Italian team Fiorentina.
	   The final lineup includes Rafael Alkorta and Imanol Etxeberria
from Athletic de Bilbao, Carlos Aguilera and Francisco ``Kiko''
Narvaez from Atletico de Madrid as well as Luis Enrique Martinez
and Sergi Barjuan from Barcelona. Real Madrid is represented by
Fernando Hierro, Raul Gonzalez and Fernando Morientes, Santiago
Canizares is called up from Valencia and Michel Salgado from Celta.
	   After Camacho's shakeup, the national squad is most influenced
by players from Real Madrid, Atletico de Madrid and Athletic de
Bilbao all of which have three representatives. FC Barcelona is
left with only two.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Protesters occupied government offices on
Friday, forcing out state workers who had heeded an order on state
radio to return to their jobs.
	   Widespread protests against the May general election, which the
ruling party won by a landslide in this southern African, continued
a day after a tri-nation commission released a report which cited
``serious concerns'' about apparent election irregularities.
	   Demonstrators also continued to gather at King Letsie III's
palace.
	   For the past two days, they had also surrounded many businesses,
seeking to paralyze the country. But on Friday, they relaxed their
grip and allowed some businesses, including the Lesotho Bank, to
open, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Armed soldiers have looked on but have not intervened in the
demonstrations since junior officers staged a mutiny on Sept. 11
and arrested their commanders. The officers have since been
released. About 20 of the deposed officers and their followers have
fled to neighboring South Africa, SAPA said.
	   In a report released Thursday, a commission composed of
representatives of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana cited
``serious concerns'' about Lesotho's elections.
	   The report said seals on ballot boxes had been prematurely
broken and material from different polling stations had been mixed
together. But the report did not suggest the election be declared
invalid and instead called for restoration of confidence in
Lesotho's electoral commission.
	   Lesotho, a Belgium-sized country of 2 million people, has a
history of political upheaval.

Refugee wave on Czech-Slovak border peaking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech police detained a total of
121 refugees in two groups Friday as they tried to cross the border
illegally from neighboring Slovakia, CTK news agency reported.
	   According to local police spokesman Jaroslav Krajcir, the wave
of refugees typical for this time of year _ before the onset of
winter _ is reaching its peak.
	   Thirty refugees from India and Pakistan were detained in
southern Moravia at 3 a.m. Friday and another group of 91 refugees
was stopped shortly afterwards, CTK reported.
	   Krajcir was unsure of the nationalities of those detained in the
second group.
	   The Czech Republic, the westernmost of the former East Bloc
countries, is a transit point for refugees trying to get to
affluent European countries such as Germany from the Balkans, Asia
and Africa.
	   ``They speak different languages and most of the time and money
is spent on bringing in interpreters'' to help deal with the cases,
Krajcir said.
	   When detained, refugees have a chance to apply for political
asylum in case of proven repression at home. Otherwise, they are
turned back to the country from which they arrived.

Hundreds of thousands hold funeral for slain Iranian diplomats

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Iranians called for
holy war Friday as they took part in a funeral procession for six
Iranians killed by Afghanistan's Taliban militia.
	   Chanting ``death to the Taliban'' and ``death to America,'' the
protesters carried six coffins, cloaked in Iran's red, white and
green flag, to Tehran University for the Friday prayers ceremony.
	   The coffins contained the bodies of five diplomats and an
Iranian journalist killed when Taliban militiamen stormed the
Iranian consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
last month.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took part in the
procession. Members of the crowd urged him to declare ``jihad,'' or
holy war, on the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   ``We are waiting for the leader to decree the jihad to deal with
Taliban. The world's armies cannot stand before us,'' protesters
chanted.
	   Khamenei did not speak during the funeral.
	   The coffins were taken to the sprawling cemetery of
Behesht-e-Zahra, south Tehran, and buried near the tomb of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.
	   Demonstrations against the Taliban were also held in the cities
of Mashhad, Arak, and Tabriz, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency said.
	   The Taliban admitted Sept. 10 to killing eight diplomats and a
journalist for the Islamic Republic News Agency after its forces
captured Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran Monday.
Iranian radio reported Friday that the Foreign Ministry could not
identify the body of one diplomat and had asked the International
Committee of the Red Cross to help.
	   The killings have brought to a head simmering tension between
Iran and the Taliban. Iran has since massed tens of thousands of
troops on its border with Afghanistan, and Khamenei has put the
military on full alert.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the border region
to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   At Tehran University, Zabihullah Bakhshi, a member of the
militant Ansar-e Hezbollah group, set his hand on one coffin.
	   ``We will get your revenge. We will not let your blood go to
waste,'' he shouted, dressed in camouflage fatigues and carrying a
rifle.
	   A statement read at the end of the funeral called on the Iranian
government to provide Afghans living in Iran with weapons to
``fight the backward Taliban militia in Afghanistan.''
	   It also called for the immediate release of other Iranian
nationals held captive by the Taliban. Tehran says some 60 Iranians
are held by the Taliban on suspicion of arms smuggling.
	   The demonstrators called on Pakistan to end its support for the
Taliban. Pakistan is widely believed to provide military and other
support to the religious army. Iran is suspected of backing the
opposition, which largely represents the country's minority ethnic
and religious groups, including minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Iran has also accused Pakistani intelligence forces of helping
the Taliban storm the Iranian consulate. Pakistan has denied
involvement in the attack.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing billions of dollars in losses, many foreign
companies in Russia are cutting staff and halting further
investment as they wait for the country to stabilize _ though they
insist the latest financial crisis will not send them running away
for good.
	   The hardest hit have been in the the consumer goods and
financial sectors, as nationwide distribution systems and the stock
market alike collapse, Scott Blacklin, president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said Thursday.
	   ``In some ways the business community feels like it was hit by a
neutron bomb and we've all been irradiated,'' he said. ``Which
means we're all alive today, but in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, some
of them are going to die.''
	   The biggest problem for many U.S. and other foreign companies
dealing in consumer goods is that their clients can't afford to pay
for goods priced in dollars as the unstable ruble rate drives them
closer to bankruptcy.
	   ``It's a serious hit to our market share,'' said Robert Bellman,
country director for the Compaq computer manufacturer. ``We don't
want to bring in a shipment if payment isn't 100 percent
guaranteed.''
	   Unloading goods is not the only problem. As Russian banks
collapse and freeze bank accounts, withdrawing assets or making
bank transfers has become almost impossible.
	   In a survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Moscow, 72 percent of both large and small foreign businesses said
they could not access some funds because of bank restructuring and
government decrees.
	   The bank failures, coupled with a government moratorium on
repaying foreign debt, has eroded foreigners' faith in the
government's desire to carry out economic reforms. Many are
delaying new investment decisions until the dust settles.
	   ``It is clear that the Russian government, whoever is comprising
it, does not have the credibility necessary to maintain an
attraction for foreign capital,'' Blacklin said. ``There seems to
have been a profound break in the former belief in the reform
process in this country.''
	   Russia's stock market, a good reflection of investor attitude
toward the government, is down more than 80 percent since the start
of the year.
	   With extensive losses, frozen assets, and investments delayed,
many companies are now laying off both local and foreign staff.
	   ``We are not replacing those people who are going to leave,''
said Bellman, of Compaq. He added that in the next few months,
Compaq would also cut about 10 percent of its 100 employees.
	   Other firms in the financial and retail sector have been forced
to lay off up to half of their employees, Blacklin said.
	   Still, the big foreign companies that have invested dlrs 21
billion in Russia since the country began its economic reforms in
1992 have no plans to close up shop, even with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's suggestion that the government may try to
protect domestic business and possibly print rubles.
	   ``When push comes to shove and they are going to continue to
need investment from the West, I think some of these things will be
modified over time,'' said Richard Weden, director of American
Express's Russia division.
	   The government said Thursday it would try to work out a new deal
over dlrs 40 billion in bad loans with foreign lenders, who face
huge losses.
	   ``We're in this for the long haul,'' Weden said. ``Though
policies of the new government may change, open market practices
will continue.''

Primakov to preside over meeting on Caucasus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will preside over
a meeting Saturday on the troubled Caucasus region of southern
Russia, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
	   The heads of the Russian Interior Ministry, Security Council and
Prosecutor General's office will also take part in the meeting,
which has been called to formulate an approach for stabilizing a
violence-torn region of North Ossetia, Ingush President Ruslan
Aushev said, according to Interfax.
	   Last weekend, unidentified attackers killed five Ossetian
policemen, and Ossetians tried to exact revenge by setting ablaze
some 200 homes of ethnic Ingush refugees. Aushev said that the
arson attacks had left the two republics ``five minutes away from
war.''
	   On Friday, he told Interfax that he would attend the meeting in
Primakov's office in Moscow, and that the president of North
Ossetia, Alexander Dzasokhov, had also been invited.
	   The Ossetian-Ingush conflict goes back to a 1944 decision by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for
collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
both groups have claimed territory that is now part of North
Ossetia.

Iranian newspaper editor heads home to certain jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The managing director of Iran's
only independent daily newspaper is flying home Saturday to be
arrested.
	   Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara is not sure what the charge is. He
doesn't know what punishment he faces, where he will be jailed, or
when he'll be able to speak publicly again.
	   So before boarding, with his wife and sons, an Iranian Airlines
flight that will land in Tehran Sunday, he talked to as many fellow
journalists as he could about Tous, the second most popular
newspaper in Iran.
	   It was shut down and banned on Wednesday, several senior editors
and publishing directors either arrested or sought on warrants.
Sazgara's name was on a warrant, too.
	   Under the circumstances, why would anyone take their family and
go home?
	   ``I'm a citizen of Iran, first of all. Second, my friends are in
jail,'' Sazgara, 43, said Friday in an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   ``Although I don't agree with this ban on our newspaper _ this
ban is against the press law _ I think that I have to go back
because I respect the law,'' he said, sipping water and rubbing
sleepy eyes.
	   Sazgara had just begun what was supposed to be a one-week
vacation. He was on a stopover in Malaysia, waiting for a flight to
join his wife and two teen-age sons in New Zealand.
	   On Wednesday, Sazgara's brother, the Iranian ambassador to New
Zealand, called to tell him that the two-month-old Tous had been
banned and Sazgara was wanted for arrest.
	   ``They have announced that Tous newspaper has been against
national security, and I believe that we have been the most
effective newspaper for national unity,'' Sazgara said.
	   ``We tried to be independent. We tried to provide different
views, multiple sources for the news. That was the main problem ...
in Iran. But that is the duty of any journalist.''
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tous was ordered
shut for publishing articles detrimental ``to the country's
national interests and security.''
	   The order came a day after Iran's supreme religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the judiciary to deal with
newspapers abusing the country's press freedoms.
	   The action was taken under the authority of the Islamic
Revolution Court, which conducts its hearings behind closed doors.
	   Curiously, an arm of the government which oversees the press
took exception in a veiled complaint.
	   ``Any press crime should be tried in a public and open court and
with the presence of a jury,'' the ministry said.
	   There has been an atmosphere of more freedom and openness since
the election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami last year.
	   Sazgara has no idea whether that sentiment will help him, or
whether the closing of Tous is part of a new period of restrictions
on speech and press as tensions build between Iran and its
neighbor, Afghanistan.
	   Tous had been calling for diplomacy instead of military strikes
and has angered some hard-liners with its anti-war stance.
	   ``All our staff, the writers and journalists, have said they are
not threatened, they are not afraid, they are ready to publish
another paper if they can get an agreement with a newspaper license
holder,'' said Sazgara.
	   Recalling reader support for his newspaper, he added, ``They
were waiting for us on the streets for our new newspaper. I can
imagine that they are waiting for us now.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Heading into national elections Sunday,
Swedes are trying to decide whether their famed Middle Way is
leading to success or is on the verge of failure.
	   After a discouraging decade in which Sweden suffered high
unemployment and the fabric of its tightly knit social services
network began to unravel, the governing Social Democrats say the
worst is over and that the country's mix of socialism and
capitalism is back on track.
	   The conservative opposition, led by the Moderates party of
former Prime Minister Carl Bildt, says the worst is yet to come
unless Sweden abandons its high-tax ways.
	   A poll by the SIFO organization published Friday in the national
newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed the Social Democrats attracting
the most support at 36.8 percent _ still far short of enough to
govern alone. The Moderates were at 24.8 percent.
	   Throughout the campaign, support levels for the two major
parties running for the 349-seat Riksdag parliament have remained
nearly flat.
	   The two parties at the far ends of the ideological spectrum are
surging. The Left Party, the former Communists, have nearly doubled
their current support to 11.8 percent, according to Friday's poll,
while the Christian Democrats are at 10.1 percent, a 150-percent
jump from the last elections in 1994.
	   The poll is based on responses from 2,329 people. No margin of
error was given.
	   A government of the Social Democrats with support from the Left
and Greens would likely continue the policies that make Sweden the
world's most heavily taxed country, according to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development: in 1997, the tax burden
was more than 53 percent of gross domestic product.
	   The high taxes support Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare benefits
and social services, but they are discouraging business. Several
major Swedish companies, including telecommunications giant LM
Ericsson, the country's largest company, have threatened to move
their headquarters out of Sweden unless the business climate
improves.
	   ``We need a few more years to restore the (social) welfare
system,'' Finance Minister Eric Aasbrink said Friday.
	   The Swedish economy is reasonably healthy. Unemployment is at
7.3 percent, but has been falling for the past two years as Sweden
digs out of the economic crisis of the early 1990s. Inflation is
virtually nil, and Aasbrink said the country foresees a budget
surplus of about 2 percent this year.
	   The Moderates say the high taxes marginalize Sweden in an
increasingly competitive global economy. They propose a tax cut of
80 billion kronor (dlrs 10 billion) over three years. That would
still keep Sweden's tax burden extraordinarily high _ about 50
percent of GDP _ but would stimulate job creation, Bildt contends.
	   Polls show about 12 percent of respondents undecided _ about
twice the level from previous elections.
	   The election's failure to capture strong interest could be
gauged from the front page of the Stockholm newspaper Aftobladet on
Friday: It led with an investigation of which liquor store has the
fastest service.

Czechs see no successor to Havel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES figures

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs have no idea who might be a
successor to Vaclav Havel although the country is evenly split over
whether the oft-ailing president should step down.
	   According to a poll released Friday by the Sofres-Factum agency,
almost two-thirds of the Czech population cannot imagine anybody
other than Havel as president.
	   ``The survey's results make it clear there is no personality who
would be perceived ... as a suitable successor to Vaclav Havel,''
the authors were quoted as saying.
	   The closest contender, parliament Speaker Vaclav Klaus, has the
support of 7 percent of the population and Premier Milos Zeman has
nearly 5 percent.
	   While Klaus is known to have presidential ambitions, Zeman has
repeatedly stated he will quit politics when his term expires in
four years.
	   According to the poll, 47 percent of those surveyed think Havel
should quit his job for health reasons, while 49 percent think he
should stay.
	   Havel, who spearheaded Czechoslovakia's anti-communist
revolution, became president in December 1989. After the
federation's breakup in 1993, he became Czech president and was
re-elected for his final five-year term Jan. 20.
	   At 61, the cancer-battling president no longer enjoys the
political power he once had, but is still seen as a father figure
in the post-communist era.
	   The agency surveyed 1,063 people at the end of August and
beginning of September. The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage
points.

Parliament strips arrest immunity of opposition leader

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian parliament voted
overwhelmingly Friday to lift the immunity of former President Sali
Berisha, clearing the way for his arrest and prosecution for
allegely trying to overthrow the government during this week's
riots.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the government would soon
attempt to serve an arrest warrant, a move which could trigger more
violent unrest from radicalized supporters.
	   Berisha's followers have been demanding President Fatos Nano
resign since last weekend's assassination of popular opposition
figure, Azem Hajdari. His death set off rioting Sunday and Monday,
in which mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television
and Nano's office.
	   International officials have been urging Nano's government to
move slowly against Berisha and allow a ``cooling off'' period
after the rioting which brought the country to the brink of anarchy
for the second time in 18 months.
	   The charge carries the death penalty, although Albania has
stopped executions under an agreement with the Europeans.
	   Before the vote, Berisha told about 3,000 people Friday in
central Skanderbeg Square that he would continue to oppose Nano's
government, even from jail. ``I'm ready to accept any sacrifice,''
he said.
	   The vote to lift immunity was 108-0 with five ballots declared
invalid. Forty-two delegates, including all those from Berisha's
Democratic Party, were absent. The Democrats won 28 of the 155
parliamentary seats in the June 1997 election but have rarely
attended any sessions.
	   It took place as another rally by chanting Berisha supporters --
carrying flags and English-language signs -- ended peacefully.
Berisha called Nano a Communist dictator. One sign described Nano
as the son of Albania's longtime Stalinist dictator, Enver Hoxha.
	   It was the third straight peaceful rally, but the small number
of protesters showed Berisha's inability to mount significant
support in the capital. There were no immediate reports of protests
elsewhere, despite Berisha's call for nationwide demonstrations.
	   President Rexhep Meidani and international officials had
appealed for calm, with Daan Everts, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe ambassador, calling for people to stay
home Friday ``so that they are not being misused for political
ends.''
	   Armed police, some wearing black hoods, turned back vehicles at
a roadblock outside the capital, allowing only those with Tirana
license plates to proceed. A stream of people walked the five
kilometers (three miles) to the city, but most seemed part of the
normal traffic flow rather than demonstrators coming to protest.
	   Police also stopped vehicles and searched for weapons on other
roads in Tirana.
	   Meidani has been working behind the scenes to find a way out of
the crisis, which Western powers fear will spread instability
further in the already volatile Balkans. Berisha has openly
supported Albanian rebels fighting for independence in neighboring
Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy and restore confidence
in the nation's future.

EU, South Africa trade talks break up without agreement

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Negotiations between the European Union
and South Africa aimed at clinching a sweeping free-trade deal
broke up without agreement Friday as the two sides wrangled over
wine and food exports.
	   ``The position has been a very hardline one from their side,''
said Elias Links, South Africa's ambassador to the EU and chief
negotiator.
	   ``What we want is for the European Commission to come back with
an agricultural offer improved.''
	   Links blamed the collapse of the 21st negotiating round between
the two sides on the EU's insistence that South Africa stop
labeling it's fortified wines as sherry or port. The EU says only
Spain can produce wines called sherry and only wines from the
Portuguese city of Oporto can be labeled as port. South Africa
claims they have used those terms for 300 years.
	   Links said the EU refused to put a new farm products offer on
the table until South Africa backed down on wine labeling. ``We
were confronted with a fait-accompli,'' Links told a news
conference at the South African mission.
	   As the talks got underway at the start of the week, both sides
were optimistic a breakthrough was possible in the four-year-old
talks to wrap up a deal covering roughly 90 percent of EU-South
Africa trade, worth a total 17 billion European currency units
(dlrs 19 million).
	   Bahle Sibisi, South Africa's director of foreign trade
relations, said he'd hoped the EU would come up with an improved
offer opening its markets to a number of South African agricultural
products, including dairy products, cut flowers, fresh and canned
fruits.
	   Although he expressed ``dismay'' at the lack of progress on the
package overall, Links said advances had been made on industrial
goods and he hoped talks could resume within the next couple of
weeks.
	   However, aside from the wine and food issues, a number of other
products remain sensitive, notably cars, chemicals and steel.
Officials from both sides also indicated fisheries would be
difficult to resolve, with the EU demanding the right to fish in
South African waters in return for opening up EU markets to South
African imports.
	   ``It's not in South Africa's interests to open up fisheries
resources in exchange for market access,'' Sibisi said.

Dutch Jewish community denounces man with new Anne Frank diary
</HEADLINE>
pages &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A researcher's demand for money to
release five newly surfaced pages of Anne Frank's diary is being
criticized as exploiting the teen-ager's legacy.
	   ``To darken her diary with his kind of dispute over money makes
people sick,'' Ronni Naftaniel, director of the Dutch Center for
Information and Documentation on Israel, said Friday.
	   At a Thursday meeting with members of the Dutch Jewish
community, Dutch researcher Cor Suijk, who revealed last month that
he has five missing pages to ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' repeated
his request for money in exchange for the pages.
	   ``I feel that I have a mission. People are entitled to criticize
me, but I feel I am morally right,'' Suijk said.
	   Suijk, the international director of the New York-based Anne
Frank Center, stunned scholars last month by demanding money for
the pages he's secretly held for almost two decades.
	   Suijk says Anne's father, Otto, gave him the pages shortly
before his death in 1980. In them, Anne criticizes her parents'
marriage and describes her own strained relationship with her
mother.
	   Suijk said he intends to hand over the pages to the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation, the custodian of Anne's
diary, as soon as he gets a financial sponsor. The sponsor would
help support his cash-strapped foundation in exchange for getting
``credit'' for the pages, which would be given to the institute,
Suijk said.
	   Though he has not received an offer, several fund-raisers have
shown interest, he said. He declined to name them.
	   He also declined to disclose the price.
	   Many at Thursday's meeting expressed anger at the plan.
	   ``For millions of people, rightly or wrongly, Anne is the symbol
of the Holocaust,'' said author Hans Knoop, a member of the
discussion panel. ``You should not abuse the pages ... or market
them.''
	   Knoop doubts Suijk will ever find a buyer.
	   ``It's negative publicity,'' he said. ``I can't imagine any
organization that would be willing to buy these pages.''
	   Entangled in the debate is also the Anne Frank Fund, which holds
the copyright to Anne's diary.
	   Suijk has repeatedly criticized the group, based in Basel,
Switzerland, for holding onto profits from the diary instead of
using them for Holocaust education, including exhibitions organized
by his New York center.
	   Naftanial, although he opposes Suijk's plan, said the Swiss fund
has not disclosed its accounts in the past and should be less
secretive.
	   Anne and her family fled Nazi Germany before the war to avoid
persecution and hid in an Amsterdam canal house from July 1942
until they were betrayed in the fall of 1944.
	   The teen-ager documented their life in hiding in a diary that
was published posthumously. She died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp weeks before it was liberated in 1945.

China to ban all leaded gasoline by end of 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Production of leaded gasoline in China must stop
by the end of next year, the government said in an order released
on Friday.
	   The government will require that all gas stations replace leaded
gasoline with unleaded on July 1, 2000, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   It also will raise taxes on leaded gas consumption to keep its
price at least as high as unleaded gasoline.
	   China's automobiles are largely unequipped for emissions
controls. The severe air pollution in Chinese cities is largely
from coal-burning, but auto emissions are an increasingly serious
problem.
	   The order on Friday from the State Council, the highest
government body, said that automobile companies will be required to
produce vehicles adapted for the use of unleaded gasoline.
	   Rudy Schlais, president of China operations for General Motors
Corp., said earlier this year that the automaker could not build
cars with catalytic converters in China, even though Beijing,
Shanghai and other cities have banned leaded fuel.
	   Schlais said that the government was unable to guarantee that
cheaper leaded fuel was not mixed with unleaded.

German central bank head plays down financial crises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ There is no immediate sign of the
economic crises in Asia and Russia dragging the rest of the world
into recession, the head of Germany's central bank said Friday.
	   Hans Tietmeyer said European economies were still relatively
robust, although would be affected by the slowdown elsewhere, and
in particular by economic developments in the United States.
	   ``There is a need for watchfulness, but not nervousness or
panic,'' he told a European forum.
	   ``I wouldn't say that we are speaking of a threatening world
recession,'' the Deutsche Bundesbank chief told the gathering in
the central Swiss town of Lucerne.
	   Stock prices have plunged in recent weeks because of fears that
not enough is being done to prevent economic crises in Asia and
Russia from worsening.
	   Asked what role the world's central banks should take now,
Tietmeyer was cautious.
	   ``The central banks must first and foremost remain calm,'' he
said.
	   ``We cannot solve problems in certain parts of the world that
are of a structural or political nature,'' he said. ``Such problems
cannot be fought with monetary policy means.''
	   Tietmeyer also urged a speedier interest rate convergence in the
countries which will use the euro currency at the start of next
year.
	   The longer central banks delayed interest rate convergence, the
more would have to be done late this year and early in 1999, he
warned.
	   The currency union starts Jan. 1, and the European Central Bank
will be responsible for setting a common interest rate for the 11
nations participating.
	   At a separate seminar in the southern Swiss city of Lugano,
Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger said he expected the euro to
be stable for a while, but warned of what he saw as longer-term
dangers.
	   ``I'm a bit less optimistic (about the euro's stability) in the
long run,'' Villiger told a conference on the euro.
	   High unemployment in the European Union and differing
productivity levels could lead to conflicts and pressure on the
European Central Bank to abandon its stability-oriented policy,
Villiger said.
	   Switzerland is not a member of the European Union. There are
fears that if the single European currency runs into difficulties,
then the Swiss franc may become a safe haven. This would force up
the Swiss franc, making vital Swiss exports more expensive.
	   If the Swiss National Bank had to try to keep down a strong
franc through a loose money policy and intervention on foreign
exchange markets, then this could lead to inflation.
	   At the other extreme, the Swiss bank might be forced to give up
its autonomy and tie the franc to the euro.
	   Villiger described the two scenarios as a choice between ``the
plague and cholera.''

Poland refuses to launch investigation into Russian prisoners of

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's justice minister said Friday
there is no evidence supporting Moscow's allegations that Poland
killed Soviet prisoners of war in 1919-20 and they do not intend to
investigate.
	   Russia's prosecutor general demanded a Polish investigation in
August into alleged mass killings of 83,500 Red Army soldiers taken
prisoners in the Polish-Soviet war.
	   Up to 18,000 Soviet POWs died in Polish camps after the war
ended, but Polish Justice Minister Hanna Suchocka said they mostly
died of diseases resulting from poor postwar conditions.
	   ``Poland did not use any special measures that would cause
extermination of POWs,'' said Suchocka.
	   According to Polish officials, there were up to 80,000 Soviet
prisoners of war in Poland when the hostilities ended. Many
remained in Poland, not wanting to return to the Soviet Russia.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Protesters occupied government offices on
Friday, forcing out state workers who had heeded an order on state
radio to return to their jobs.
	   Widespread protests against the May general election, which the
ruling party won by a landslide in this southern African country,
continued a day after a tri-nation commission released a report
which cited ``serious concerns'' about apparent election
irregularities.

Top Kosovo Albanian endorses peace plan, Serb offensive continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout and UPDATES with details from the
offensive &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader
gave his backing Friday to a U.S.-sponsored plan denying his people
the independence they seek but offering them peace and local
autonomy within Serbia.
	   Ibrahim Rugova's endorsement for the plan came amid reports of
further battlefield losses by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian guerrillas
to better armed Serbian and Yugoslav forces.
	   More than 260,000 people _ most of them ethnic Albanian
villagers _ have been made homeless by the fighting, including an
estimated 50,000 refugees living in the mountains and forests.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said the Serb-Yugoslav alliance ended a
three-day offensive north of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and moved
southwest to the Drenica region, apparently to mop up the last
pocket of fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA has rejected any negotiated settlement short of
independence from Serbia, the dominant of two republics remaining
in Yugoslavia. But they have been marginalized after months of
defeats by Serb police and the Yugoslav army.
	   The U.S.-backed Rugova also favors independence but opposes
fighting for it. U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that
Rugova had in principle accepted the American plan, as had Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Rugova called the draft a ``temporary solution,'' aimed at
``normalizing the difficult and risky situation ... halting attacks
and the use of force.''
	   On Thursday, some details of the three-year plan were published
in the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore. It would give ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo, thee say over local
affairs but keep them part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
Kosovo's autonomy was revoked in 1989 by Milosevic.
	   In the latest Serb offensive, government forces killed at least
20 civilians and destroyed virtually all the 500 houses in three
villages, residents of nearby Kicic village told The Associated
Press. Columns of smoke billowed from the area Friday.
	   Sporadic machine-gun and small arms fire impeded access to the
villages.
	   ``The Serbs came and they had so many tanks,'' said Rexhep
Mustafa, 54, whose brother, Halil, was shot to death Thursday.
	   ``Halil called for help, help for three minutes,'' said Mustafa,
tears welling in his eyes as he undressed his brothers' body for a
Muslim burial.
	   Residents said dozens of tanks, backed by heavy artillery, Serb
police and Yugoslav soldiers scattered secessionist guerrilla
forces in the last two days.
	   ``The police just shelled and shelled and left,'' said a
27-year-old resident of Kicic who identified himself only as
Ibrahim.
	   At least 10 tanks and armored personnel carriers with mounted
machine-guns were seen leaving the Kicic area Friday.
	   One kilometer (About half a mile) away, most of the about 100
houses of Smrekovnica village smoldered, near burned-out cars and
smoking haystacks. Bullet and artillery holes or other signs of
fighting were not visible.
	   In Geneva, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said Friday that the latest offensive
has prompted about 10,000 people to flee at least 13 villages in
the region between Podujevo and Mitrovica in the north.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, said Janowski, the UNHCR
spokesman. Many were reportedly sick or wounded.

Beckenbauer becomes member of the DFB board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer, a former star who
is now chairman of Bayern Munich, will become a member of the board
of the German soccer federation (DFB), the DFB announced Friday.
	   Beckenbauer's job will be to be responsible for ``future
questions'' of the DFB and to be closely linked with Germany's bid
to stage the 2006 World Cup.
	   Earlier, a report said Germany's soccer boss wants Beckenbauer
to return to the national team, not as coach but as ``team
director'' _ a new post apparently created to put ``Der Kaiser''
indirectly in charge.
	   The report by the biweekly magazine Kicker, Germany's top soccer
publication, was posted on its web site.
	   It said German soccer federation (DFB) president Egidius Braun
made the proposal at the meeting of DFB officials in Frankfurt
Friday.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the report from DFB officials
and it was not immediately clear if working with the national team
was also part of Beckenbauer's job description.
	   By becoming national team director, a previously non-existent
post, Beckenbauer would in effect become boss of coach Erich
Ribbeck and his assistant Uli Stielike, who were named last week to
replace Berti Vogts
	   Kicker said Beckenbauer's official position would be to
``support'' Ribbeck and Stielike.
	   But with his enormous influence in German soccer and his
charisma, it would be hard to imagine Beckenbauer playing second
fiddle to Ribbeck and Stielike.
	   Ribbeck declined to comment on the report.
	   ``I don't want to confirm or deny anything,'' he said. ``I can
only say something when it's officials.''
	   Beckenbauer, a former star who captained Germany to the 1974
World Cup title, coached the nation to its third and last World Cup
triumph, in 1990 in Italy.
	   He declined to take charge of the national team again when Vogts
resigned under severe public criticism for Germany's quarterfinal
failure at this summer's World Cup and two dismal performances at
two exhibition games earlier this month.
	   Braun himself has come under fire for his handling of the
question of Vogts' succession and several soccer personalities have
proposed Beckenbauer for DFB president.
	   After initially not ruling himself out, Beckenbauer said earlier
two days ago he was not striving for the job.

Survey: Boston popular among British
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The British keep coming.
	   British readers of an international travel magazine have ranked
Boston's food the best of the world's 100 most popular cities.
	   ``The typical British tourist comes over for our seafood,'' said
Bill MacDougall, director of international marketing for the
Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism. ``Our lobster is very
popular and it represents a little bit of a different piece of
America.''
	   MacDougall estimates Boston hosts about 400,000 British tourists
each year, thanks in large part to an aggressive international
marketing campaign.
	   A survey conducted by Conde Nast Traveler UK, a New York-based
travel and tourism magazine, said Boston was second best overall
city in the world, following only Sydney, Australia. The magazine,
which polled 26,000 British readers, gave Boston high marks for
culture, climate, safety and friendliness of the locals.
	   Boston Mayor Thomas Menino beamed at the news.
	   ``Boston has done it again,'' he told the Boston Herald. ``We
have been recognized for being a reputable and memorable city with
character.''

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov comments on banking system, corruption,
alcohol monopoly. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank said Friday it planned to print
rubles as part of a plan to aid the troubled banking system, but
the news did nothing to aid the currency, which again plummeted.
	   Newly confirmed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov meanwhile said
his government's goal would be to restore confidence that Russia
could meet its debt obligations and to stabilize the exchange rate
between the ruble and the U.S. dollar. He stressed that the
government would achieve these goals by using economic levers
rather than government decrees.
	   Primakov told reporters that the previous government's
announcement that it would default on debts had struck ``a heavy
blow against the country's prestige,'' and that his
government-in-formation was already beginning to work to restore
confidence.
	   The government wants to ensure that the country's shaky banks
don't fail, and it also wants to pay overdue wages to state
workers.
	   But economists have warned of the danger of hyperinflation if
the government pumps too much money into the economy to meet these
goals. Prices soared 43 percent in just the first two weeks of
September.
	   The Central Bank invited leading Russian banks to submit lists
of all outstanding debts and said it would lower reserve
requirements for banks in relatively sound financial position.
	   That means the banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on
hand, and could settle debts, improving the overall liquidity in
the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those bills had been frozen by the Central Bank last month.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some treasury bills. Kozlov
wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed it would
be strictly limited.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble was down again. The official rate set by
the Central Bank was 14.60 rubles to the dollar on Thursday night
and 16.38 on Friday night.
	   The Russian media generally supported the Central Bank's move as
a way to protect the banks.
	   ``The decision made by the Central Bank is justified,'' said the
business daily Kommersant. ``Today we already have the ruble
falling and inflation, but the nation can't live without the
banking system.''
	   The economic crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill. It also threatens to
bring broader economic activity to a halt.
	   Primakov, in his talk with Russia media, said that the country's
banking system would start working again next week.
	   In a move to help importers and exporters, the Central Bank on
Friday revoked its earlier order requiring them to secure
pre-payments for their transactions.
	   The move was taken ``in order to avoid shortage of staples and
medicines,'' the Central Bank said in a statement released to the
media. Many Russians stocked up on medicines when the crisis hit,
leaving pharmacy shelves bare.
	   Primakov also said that the government plans to introduce a
monopoly on the alcohol and tobacco markets, in order to secure
revenues for the federal budget, and to he pledged his government
``will get rid of corruption and bribery once and for all.''
	   ``We want to create a Cabinet of professionals and decent people
rather than a government formed according to party lists,''
Primakov said.
	   The composition and policies of the new Russian cabinet remained
in limbo Friday.
	   Adding to the confusion, a moderate lawmaker appointed deputy
prime minister in charge of social affairs earlier this week
announced Friday he was rejecting the job.
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a 32-year old deputy speaker of the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, said he lacked the
experience to handle the job during the crisis.
	   ``It would be a gamble to accept this job now when pensions and
wages are months overdue,'' Ryzhkov told reporters after meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``I wouldn't like to make
irresponsible decisions.''
	   Dealing with social affairs is considered one of the toughest
jobs in government because the state has run up huge debts to
millions of Russian workers and pensioners.
	   In another Cabinet appointment, Vadim Gustov, 50, the governor
of the St. Petersburg region was named first deputy prime minister
in charge of relations with Russia's regions.

Both Georges, tropical depression expected to strengthen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with 11 a.m. coordinates. &QL; 
 &UR; By KAREN L. SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Islanders kept an eye on strengthening Hurricane
Georges as it headed toward the eastern Caribbean with 100 mph (160
kph) winds, while Gulf Coast residents braced for the return of
tropical weather.
	   Georges became the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season on
Thursday, the same day the season's eighth tropical depression
developed over the Gulf of Mexico.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Georges' eye was near 13.1 north
latitude, 46.6 west longitude, or about 960 miles (1,500
kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles, where forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch might be necessary
later Friday.
	   The category 2 storm was moving west near 21 mph (34 kph), a
course it was expected to maintain through Saturday morning.
	   ``Strengthening is indicated and Georges is forecast to become a
category 4 hurricane,'' Avila said. A category 4 storm has winds of
at least 131 mph (210 kph).
	   Forecasters urged people in the Lesser Antilles to monitor
Georges.
	   ``It's really too early to talk about any potential impact on
the continental U.S.,'' said oceanographer Stephen Baig. ``It's
something that needs to be kept under a watchful eye.''
	   Meanwhile, people in Texas and Louisiana waited to see what the
depression in the Gulf would do.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT Friday, the system was centered at 26.1 north
latitude, 92.4 west longitude, about 285 miles (455 kilometers)
south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, with winds near 35 mph. The
depression wasn't moving much, but was expected to drift northward,
said forecasters at the hurricane center.
	   The system was disorganized, but still expected to strengthen.
	   ``The depression could become a tropical storm later today,''
hurricane specialist Lixion Avila said Friday morning in an
advisory.
	   A tropical storm watch was up along a 460-mile (735-kilometer)
stretch from Matagorda, Texas to Pascagoula, Mississippi. The watch
was likely to be discontinued later Friday west of High Island,
Texas, forecasters said. Small craft from Matagorda to Port
Aransas, Texas, were advised to remain in port.

Canadian, Seychelles boxers move to finals after dream fights

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defending champion Mark Simmons of
Canada recovered from two 8-counts in the first round and a 10-6
deficit in the third to defeat Kevin Evans of Wales Friday in a
heavyweight semifinal at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Five other Canadians, including four defending champs, also
moved to the finals while Australia suffered its worst day at the
ring: all four boxers lost.
	   Simmons, a physical sciences student at York University,
Toronto, said he was aware he was behind Evans but didn't know by
how much.
	   ``I got a lesson today, not to overlook people, take people too
casually,'' said Simmons, 24.
	   He will fight the final with Roland Raforme of Seychelles who
also scored a dream victory over Garth Da Silva of New Zealand in
the second semifinal.
	   Da Silva led 11-4 going into the fifth round but an inspired
Raforme broke through his defenses with jabs and hooks on the face
to take the fight 15-13.
	   After the match, Da Silva hugged his trainer and wept for five
minutes. He said the game plan was to let his opponent come to him
instead of rushing into the fight. That caution cost him the bout.
	   In another high-profile fight, Brian Magee of Northern Ireland
lost to John Pearce of England 29-19 in the middleweight category.
	   Magee, who had defeated defending champion Rowan Donaldson of
Jamaica on Thursday, was completely out of form Friday, giving away
a 4-0 lead to John in the first round, 9-1 in the second and 19-9
by the third.
	   The day's highlight was, however, Canadian Simmons' recovery.
	   He was down 6-1 in the first round after being knocked down by
Evans. Simmons recovered but, seconds later, Evans threw a hook to
his opponent's head and the referee gave the Canadian another
8-count.
	   Simmons finished the third round down 10-6, 12-11 in the fourth
yet won the fight 19-11.
	   ``I knew Mark had the tools. He just had to get them out of the
tool box,'' said his manager, Gord Apolloni.
	   In a light flyweight bout, Sapok Biki raised hopes for host
Malaysia's first ever boxing gold after defeating Gary Jones of
England before a crowd of 1,000.
	   Jones was furious after losing the fight 15-11, complaining
about the judges.
	   ``I thought I won it and at the end of the day I've been robbed
of a gold medal,'' the Englishman said.
	   Malaysian boxing manager Abdullah Siok also cried foul after
Tanzania's Michael Yomba was declared winner over Malaysia's Adnan
Yusoh in bantamweight.
	   ``The standard of judging is suspect,'' he said.
	   Believing he had won, Yusoh was quick to celebrate in his
corner. He was sobbing seconds later when the referee lifted the
hand of his opponent.
	   Canada's Andrew Kooner, so dominant in earlier rounds, was next
to complain after losing closely to Cameroon's Herman Ngoudjo 17-16
in the other bantamweight fight.
	   He and Trevor Stewardson were the only Canadians to drop out of
gold contention.
	   On Sunday, Canada looks set to repeat its four-gold feat at the
Victoria Games. The best bets are Simmons and other defending
champions, Jeremy Molitor (welterweight), Marty O'Donnel
(featherweight), Michael Strange (light welterweight) and Troy Amos
Ross (light heavyweight).
	   Only Scott MacIntosh (light middleweight) faces an uphill battle
in a fight against England's Chris Bassey. In the semifinal Bassey
mauled Scotland's Jackie Townsley, extracting 43 points until the
referee stopped the fight in the final round to prevent further
injury.
	   Another Englishman, Audley Harrison, knocked out Justin
Whitehead of Australia in round 3 of super heavyweight.

Song composed for German unity day shows country still divided
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A nation's anthem is usually played and loved by
all parties in an election campaign. But as Germany's race enters
its final week, the ``Deutschlandlied'' is no longer just
background music.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's camp accuses left-wing politicians
organizing next month's German Unity Day celebrations of
desecrating the anthem by hiring a composer to add a few bars from
the one played in communist East Germany. Some are threatening to
boycott the official festivities.
	   Leftists say the conservatives stomped on the sensitivities of
18 million former East Germans in their effort to score political
points.
	   With only a week until the Sept. 27 parliamentary election, no
one is sure how the anthem fight will play among those voters, now
a potentially vital swing region in a tight national race.
	   But the reaction underscores how Germans from the two halves are
still struggling to follow the same tune, eight years after
unification.
	   The composition was commissioned by the state government in
Lower Saxony to be played at the official Oct. 3 Unity Day
ceremony, to be held in the state capital of Hanover this year.
	   The state's governor happens to be Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democrat challenging Kohl in the federal election.
	   When word about the ``musical collage'' got out this summer,
Kohl's party wasted no time blasting Schroeder and the Social
Democrats for ``tactlessness.''
	   Germany's national anthem, to music written by Joseph Haydn in
1797, was kept by the western half after World War II, although the
controversial first verse from 1841 starting with ``Deutschland,
Deutschland ueber alles'' (Germany above all), is no longer sung.
	   The general secretary of Kohl's conservative Christian
Democrats, Peter Hintze, says the anthem is ``the melody of
freedom,'' and shouldn't be ``disfigured'' by mixing in a few bars
of the anthem used in the former communist east.
	   Another Kohl ally, Bavaria Gov. Edmund Stoiber, said he would
boycott the national ceremony if the song is played, contending
that the communist-era passage would mock the memory of all who
suffered under East Germany's totalitarian government.
	   But many in the east, far from being offended, are at a loss to
understand the fuss.
	   ``A mix of both German anthems is also a symbol of the growing
together from east and west,'' says Uschi Kretschmer, a 40-year-old
businessman from the eastern city of Magdeburg.
	   The coach of the Magdeburg water polo team, Hannes Koch, says
the East German anthem reminds him of ``the great performances of
our athletes at world championships and Olympic games.''
	   Another easterner, Social Democratic deputy chairman Wolfgang
Thierse, told German radio that history ``will always include
conflicting, bitter memories'' that can't just be ignored.
	   Bardo Henning, the 40-year-old pianist and jazz composer from
Berlin who fused the anthems, says he was caught off guard by the
passionate reaction to the piece, meant to showcase east-west
integration.
	   The criticism suggests that the process has a ways to go, he
said. ``But maybe the debate spurred by this composition can
contribute to that too.''
	   Officials in Lower Saxony insist the composition will be
presented as planned. Germany's official national anthem will then
be played at the end of the ceremony _ unaltered and in its
entirety.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Iranians joined a
funeral procession Friday for six Iranians killed by the Taliban
militia that controls most of neighboring Afghanistan, and mourners
called for a holy war.
	   Chanting ``death to the Taliban'' and ``death to America,'' the
protesters carried six coffins, cloaked in Iran's red, white and
green flag, to Tehran University for the Friday prayer ceremony.
	   The coffins contained the bodies of five diplomats and an
Iranian journalist killed when Taliban militiamen stormed the
Iranian consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
last month.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took part in the
procession. The crowd urged him to declare ``jihad,'' or holy war,
on the Taliban Islamic army, which controls 90 percent of
Afghanistan.
	   Khamenei did not speak during the funeral.
	   Demonstrations against the Taliban were also held in the cities
of Mashhad, Arak, and Tabriz, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   The killings have brought to a head simmering tension between
Iran and the Taliban. Iran has since massed tens of thousands of
troops on its border with Afghanistan, and Khamenei has put the
military on full alert.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the border region
to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The Taliban admitted Sept. 10 to killing eight diplomats and a
journalist for the Islamic Republic News Agency after its forces
captured Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran on
Monday. Iranian radio reported Friday that the Foreign Ministry
could not identify the body of one diplomat and had asked the
International Committee of the Red Cross to help.
	   The coffins were taken Friday to the sprawling cemetery of
Behesht-e-Zahra, south Tehran, and buried near the tomb of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.

Hoddle job intact, extension a possibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Hoddle quote, background on other national coaching
changes.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle emerged from a
meeting with the Football Association's international committee
Friday with his job intact.
	   Hoddle presented his France 98 World Cup report to the committee
but was not called to task, as expected, on his controversial World
Cup diary or his links with faith healer Eileen Drewery.
	   After the meeting, international committee chairman Noel White
said Hoddle had a majority backing of the committee.
	   Another committee was formed to consider a two-year contract
extension for Hoddle, F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly said.
	   He has two years remaining on a four-year contract, which will
take him through to the end of the Euro 2000 campaign. The new
contract will encompass the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South
Korea.
	   If Hoddle does take England to the next World Cup, he will be
one of a select few surviving coaches from the recent campaign.
Retirements, sackings and resignations have already cleared out a
dozen of the national team coaches at France '98.
	   Before Friday's meeting, Kelly said ``obvious pressure points in
Hoddle's stewardship'' would be debated.
	   Hoddle declined to comment on the meeting, other than to say it
was shorter the usual and stuck to the agenda set two months ago.
	   Later, Kelly said that although certain officials had views
about Hoddle's book and his use of Drewery in team preparations,
the issues did not come onto the agenda.
	   ``(the sub-committee) will receive those views and deal with
them,'' he said.
	   ``I'm sure there are concerns in so far as the book is
concerned, albeit there were no confidences breached, and about Mrs
Drewery. These will be addressed in the talks which are going
ahead.''
	   Hoddle's tenure as coach has become increasingly uncertain after
a Euro qualifier loss to Sweden and public backlash over his World
Cup diary and links with Drewery.
	   Hoddle was accused of betraying the trust of players in the
diary and later of improper business links with Drewery.
	   He has recently been linked with a move to his old club,
Tottenham, to replace Christian Gross as manager.
	   The F.A.'s show of faith in Hoddle goes against a trend which
has recently emerged in Europe.
	   Spanish coach Javier Clemente was forced to resign last week
after Spain suffered a humiliating 3-2 loss to Cyprus in a Euro
2000 qualifier. He was already under pressure because of Spain's
first-round elimination at the World Cup.
	   Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev also resigned last week in the wake
of a 3-0 loss to Poland in a Euro 2000 qualifier. Italy's Cesare
Maldini was fired after his team's World Cup quarterfinal loss to
France.
	   Norway coach Egil Olen resigned after the World Cup, although
his successor, Nils Johan, had a tragic start when his side slumped
to a 3-1 loss to Latvia in a Euro 2000 qualifier.
	   German coach Berti Vogts resigned after Germany's World Cup
campaign ended at the quarterfinals.
	   In contrast, France's World Cup winning coach Aime Jacquet
retired at the top after a 3-0 win over Brazil in the final, while
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink stepped down to join Spanish club Real
Madrid after leading the Netherlands to the quarterfinals.
	   Other non-European national coaches resigned after the world
cup.
	   Brazil's Mario Zagallo resigned after the final.
	   United States coach Steve Sampson quit after the U.S. failed to
win a match in the world cup finals, as did Japan's Takeshi Okada.
	   South Africa dropped Philippe Troussier after he steered the
country to its first world cup finals tournament, although he later
took over the Japanese team.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tropical Storm Todd veered westward toward China
Friday, leaving at least six people injured, smashing windows and
blowing away roof tiles in southern Japan.
	   Three people in Miyazaki Prefecture (state), 890 kilometers (560
miles) southwest of Tokyo, suffered minor cuts from broken glass
and other flying objects, police said. In nearby Kagoshima, three
people were injured when struck by falling objects.
	   Gusty wind left 160 houses temporarily out of electricity and
damaged nearly 40 houses, police said.
	   Todd was weakening to pack winds of up to 90 kph (56 mph) and
downgraded from typhoon status Friday.
	   As of 10:50 p.m. (1350 GMT), the storm was 230 kilometers (142
miles) southwest of Yakushima island at the tip of Kyushu, about
1,200 kilometers (744 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Government weather forecasters said the storm was headed
westward at 35 kph (22 mph) away from Japan by late Friday and not
expected to pass over the more heavily populated main island of
Honshu.
	   They warned of continuing rainstorms on the southwestern island
of Kyushu as well as western Japan, with maximum rainfall of up to
100 to 200 millimeters (4 to 8 inches). The Meteorological Agency
also warned against possible landslides.

British Broadcasting Corp. plans to go digital next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Broadcasting Corp. announced Friday that
it will switch on four free digital television channels next week.
	   BBC1, BBC2, BBC News24 and the new channel BBC Choice _ extended
sport and theme programming _ will become available in the new
format beginning next Wednesday. The first three channels, already
in operation, will continue to be available in the present format,
as well.
	   The technology of digital television promises better sound and
picture quality.
	   Viewers will not have to pay for the digital channels though new
hardware will be needed. Digital decoders for pay-TV subscribers
will be available at the beginning of October. The decoders for use
with normal TV aerials are not expected to be in the shops until
November. And televisions already designed to handle digital
programming are expected to come on the market next year.
	   ``The revolution is dawning,'' said Sir John Birt, the director
general of the BBC. ``It may take a decade or even a generation to
come to full fruition, but the revolution begins now.''
	   Consumer groups fear poor people who are unable to upgrade their
televisions will be left behind, particularly as new stations
exclusive to digital transmitting are introduced. Ruth Evans,
spokeswoman for the National Consumer Council, said the decoders
would likely cost 200 pounds (dlrs 340).
	   And even those people who do make their televisions capable of
receiving digital broadcasts may find the best programs are only
available on pay TV, Evans said. Birt acknowledged that problem,
but he promised the BBC would honor its commitment to keep its
popular programs available to everyone.

New government offensive causes fresh refugees exodus

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A new Serb government offensive in northern Kosovo
has emptied at least 13 villages and sent more than 10,000 ethnic
Albanians fleeing, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo is worsening by the day,''
said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   More than 260,000 people have been made homeless and scores of
villages destroyed by the Serb attacks against Albanian rebels.
Many of the displaced are struggling to survive in the open as the
harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   Some have spilled over the border into neighboring countries.
About 9,000 ethnic Albanians have fled to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
placing additional strains on authorities still trying to cope with
the aftermath of the Bosnian war. About 500 ethnic Albanians
blocked UNHCR's offices in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on
Thursday, appealing for shelter and food, said Janowski.
	   Aid workers on Thursday located about 25,000 displaced people
from central Kosovo living without food or medicine in a canyon
along the border with Montenegro, Janowski said. Many were
reportedly sick or wounded.
	   The latest government offensive, which began earlier this week,
is concentrated on 13 villages in a previously peaceful region some
30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital, Pristina. At the
last census in 1991 about 10,000 people lived in the area.
	   Janowski said Serb soldiers and police prevented UNHCR from
entering the area, although U.N. staff could see smoke coming from
one of the villages, Bajgora.
	   On the road, UNHCR staff met a family of 13, including nine
women and children, crammed into the wagon of their tractor. They
had escaped from Bajgora and had slept in open fields in drenching
rain for the previous two nights. An old woman in the wagon was
crying.
	   All the villagers told the same story, said Janowski. They
received word they would be attacked and so fled. Shortly after the
shelling started.
	   The United Nations is sending daily convoys to the displaced but
has warned this will not be enough to prevent a tragedy this
winter.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, George E.
Moose, on Friday told U.N. refugee high commissioner, Sadako Ogata,
that Washington would give dlrs 10 million to the U.N. refugee
agency in response to a recent appeal.
	   This will be taken from the dlrs 20 million promised by
President Bill Clinton Sept. 9 to overall aid operations in Kosovo.

European truckers talks break down, highway chaos likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Talks between European truckers unions
and management on better working conditions broke down Friday,
raising the threat of stronger protest actions and renewed chaos on
European Union roads.
	   The 15-nation EU had hoped both sides would have clinched an
agreement limit average working hours for truck and coach drivers
to 45 hours a week at Friday's talks.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spend
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   ``A great opportunity has been missed,'' said EU transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock. Both sides will hold new consultations
on Sept. 30.
	   After that, the Commission will table its own proposals.
	   French truckers are particularly insistent about their working
conditions. Last November, a strike disrupted France and traffic
with neighboring nations for five days, and in 1996 they stopped
work for 12 days.
	   Barring an agreement, ``We will see more strikes, more protest
action,'' said an EU Commission official, who demanded anonymity.

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ The execution of 18 adults and children
left neighbors wondering why people seemingly so peaceful and
well-liked were shot to death by a criminal firing squad.
	   Some speculated the answer would be found in the drug trade and
related gunbattles that have swept northern Mexico, but prosecutors
withheld judgment.
	   ``We cannot say 100 percent that it was an aspect of drug
trafficking or for some other motive,'' the attorney general of
Baja California state, Marco Antonio de la Fuente Villarreal, said
at a news conference Thursday, hours after the massacre.
	   Officials said Friday that they had made no arrests but had some
leads. A 15-year-old girl who survived the attack by hiding under a
bed was under treatment for shock.
	   Gunmen lined the victims against a wall, made them lie face-down
and shot them before dawn.
	   The three families appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed
up; most of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all.
	   The brutality of the killings prompted fear and outrage.
	   ``They are savages,'' barked Hugo Rodriguez, a fisherman who
lives a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the sprawling ranch compound
where the bodies of nine adults, two teen-agers, six children and a
baby were found.
	   Rodriguez noted that Mexico's most violent drug trafficking
cartel, the Arellano Felix brothers, ``has spread fear and terror''
in Baja California.
	   Earlier in the day, the government news agency Notimex quoted
the attorney general as saying Fermin Castro, who was seriously
injured in the attack, was suspected of growing marijuana for the
Arellano Felix gang based in Tijuana, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
north.
	   Of the 20 people lined against the wall, only Castro and a
teen-aged boy survived. The boy was in critical condition Friday at
a local hospital, state authorities said.
	   Another person also was listed as wounded, but it was unclear
whether that person was the 15-year-old girl, whom authorities said
was treated for shock, or another shooting victim.
	   State government officials initially had listed Castro among the
dead and gave the death toll at 19. But government spokesman Juan
Ruiz Contreras said Friday that was a mistake, and that Castro
remained in a coma.
	   Police said Castro had been under police investigation in the
past for reasons they would not disclose.
	   ``He was involved in something,'' said federal highway police
Capt. Fernando Rodriguez Goni, implying ``something'' illegal.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   About two dozen horses whinnied and pigs grunted at the
compound, where a late-model Jeep Cherokee and several flatbed
trucks with the slogan ``El Indio Rodeo'' after Castro's nickname,
``The Indian,'' were parked.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A provincial lawmaker from Pakistan's
ruling party was among four people shot and killed Friday in the
eastern Punjab province in the latest hit and run attacks against a
prominent figure, police said.
	   Police said two unidentified gunmen on a motorbike opened fire
with automatic weapons on a vehicle used by Punjab assembly member
Amanullah Babar near Narowal city, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
the provincial capital of Lahore.
	   Babar was killed instantly, while his three companions died
later in a hospital.
	   No group has claimed the responsibility for the attack.
	   Police said the murder was a result of political rivalry, but
did not elaborate.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in Pakistan's political,
religious and ethnic violence in recent years.

Ethiopia gets Swiss bank papers for its case against ex-minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has handed over to Ethiopia
the first Swiss bank documents in a corruption case, officials
said.
	   The remaining papers will be turned over as soon as Ethiopia
meets Swiss demands for guarantees that its legal proceedings will
safeguard human rights of the defendants, said the Federal Office
for Police Affairs.
	   At issue are bank assets of former Ethiopian deputy prime
minister Tamrat Layne, whom the Ethiopian government charges with
corruption and abuse of power.
	   The office declined to go into detail about what documents had
been handed over and which were still being withheld.
	   Switzerland's supreme court, which required the human-rights
guarantees, also has blocked handing over to Ethiopian authorities
dlrs 8 million in Swiss bank accounts belonging to Tamrat.
	   The Federal Tribunal held that the money, which has been frozen,
can be given to Ethiopian authorities only if Tamrat receives a
valid sentence that can be carried out.
	   The court deferred an order issued by the Swiss police affairs
office last April that approved the transfer of the bank documents
and money on grounds that ``the criminal origin of these funds is
clearly established.''
	   The office froze the money in a Geneva bank last December in
response to a request for legal aid from the Ethiopian government.
	   Tamrat served as the second-highest-ranking official in Ethiopia
from 1991 until his ouster in 1996.
	   Tamrat, who was also Ethiopian defense chief, was fired in
October 1996 for involvement in high-level corruption. Since then
the Ethiopian government has been trying to get the money.
	   The court expressed reservations about the observance of human
rights in Ethiopia. Among the guarantees that it demanded are that
Swiss official representatives be able to visit Tamrat and any
codefendants imprisoned in the case without obstacle.

Libya calls Arab League stand on sanctions a joke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's foreign minister has dismissed as a
joke a decision this week by the Arab League to respect a six-year
U.N. ban on flights to or from Libya.
	   The minister, Omar al-Muntasser, said the decision falls short
of a stand by African countries to ignore the embargo imposed on
Libya to force it to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency said Friday.
	   The Arab League said Thursday that it would break the sanctions
as soon as the United States, Britain and Libya agree on measures
to put the two Libyan suspects on trial in the Netherlands. Until
then, its member countries should adhere to the embargo.
	   ``The decision ... by the Arab League, with regard to Lockerbie,
is a joke,'' al-Muntasser was quoted as saying by the agency.
	   In its June summit, the Organization of African Unity voted
unanimously to ignore the air sanctions. Since then, several
African leaders have flown to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

 &UR; Hamas supporters clash with Israeli troops; 32 injured
 &UR; Eds: For AMs, UPDATES with positive quote from Palestinian
official, 8th-9th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during the two-day
Jewish Near Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the
group's bomb makers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, the crowd stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement. Troops fired rubber
bullets, injuring 32 Palestinians, including one who was in serious
condition with a chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross told
Palestinian negotiators Friday he was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Ross held a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. After the meeting a senior Palestinian official told The
Associated Press some progress had been made.
	   ``Mr Ross managed to bridge the gaps on some issues,'' said
Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving for Washington on Saturday to brief U.S. President
Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.
	   Also Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered a Jewish West Bank
settler held until Sunday, on suspicion he shot to death an
17-year-old Palestinian in the village of Beitunia on Thursday.
	   The settler, Avshalom Ladani from the Dolev settlement, had
turned himself in several hours after the shooting. Ladani had been
driving through Beitunia when the incident occurred.
	   Loudness lawyer, Yair Golan, said his client acted in
self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, and that he shot
only in the air.
	   However, Palestinians said Ladani opened fire unprovoked,
seriously wounding two Palestinian teen-age boys who were walking
home from school. One of the injured, Iyad Kabasma, died of his
wounds at Ramallah Hospital on Thursday afternoon, while a second
boy remained in stable condition.
	   Kabasma was buried Friday afternoon in the village of Ein Arik
near Beitunia, and hundreds of mourners chanted ``long live the
rifle.'' A wall slogan in the village signed by Arafat's Fatah
movement read, ``Shame to those who support co-existence with the
occupiers.''

French legislators visit Rwandan genocide tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ French lawmakers investigating France's
role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda met Friday with officials of
the international tribunal that is hearing cases against the
alleged masterminds of the slaughter.
	   Bernard Cazeneuve and Pierre Brana, members of a French
parliamentary panel, held talks with Judge Yakov Ostrovsky, acting
president of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
prosecutors and a defense attorneys in this northern Tanzanian
town, a statement said. There were no other details.
	   French lawmakers opened their investigation in March and are
expected to produce a report in December.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus, were slain during a 90-day government- orchestrated
slaughter after President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed when his
plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on April 6,
1994.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Paris intervened in southwestern Rwanda towards the end of the
killings with ``Operation Turquoise'' with the objective of halting
the bloodshed and bringing in humanitarian aid. But the force has
been accused of protecting, and possibly arming, the Hutus during
the crisis.
	   France's ties with Habiyarimana's government have also come
under scrutiny.
	   The tribunal has convicted one person of crimes of genocide and
handed down its first sentence on Sept. 4 to another who had
confessed. Jean Kambanda, who served as Rwandan prime minister
during the killing, was sentenced to life in prison.
	   There are 31 defendants in custody in Arusha awaiting trial.
	   In Rwanda, about 130,000 people are in prison awaiting trial on
genocide charges. So far, 22 people have been convicted, sentenced
to death and executed by firing squad.

Bahamas to join Caribbean countries in making executions easier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBY NASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas plans to follow the example
of several Caribbean nations and make it easier to execute
convicted criminals, Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham said this week
as legislators began a new session.
	   Crime has become a top concern among Bahamians and the
government is taking several measures, Ingraham said. The
government's new budget includes an additional dlrs 5 million for
the police force, enough to pay for 200 more personnel and 60
additional vehicles.
	   Ingraham also said the appeals process must be revised because
convicts abuse it to avoid execution.
	   The Privy Council in London, which serves as the final court of
appeals in many former British colonies, ruled in 1993 that
prisoners cannot be kept on death row for more than five years. As
a result, many prisoners have their death sentences commuted by
delaying their executions with appeals.
	   In the Bahamas, the death sentences of 17 convicts have been
commuted this year.
	   ``It does not make sense to have a law in relation to capital
punishment which is not enforced,'' said Ingraham. ``There is no
doubt it is the desire of the majority of the Bahamian people that
this law ought to be enforced.''
	   ``Unacceptable levels'' of violent crime, especially in Nassau,
have ``produced great, great fear, beyond anything in our prior
experience,'' the prime minister said.
	   Several Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Trinidad and
Barbados have proposed replacing the Privy Council with a regional
court to handle appeals more quickly and allow resumption of
executions.
	   Currently, 30 convicts are on death row in the Bahamas.

 &UR; U.S. envoy links aid to implementation of Dayton &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with more quotes from Gelbard, OSCE, changes
byline and dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - With the moderate
incumbent believed trailing in the race for the Bosnian Serb
presidency, a senior U.S. official Friday linked continued U.S. aid
to respect for democracy and a commitment to peace in Bosnia.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy for the Balkans, arrived here
following reports that ultra-nationalist Nikola Poplasen was
leading the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in incomplete returns
from the Sept. 12-13 election.
	   A Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It would also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   Bosnians chose candidates for the three-member joint national
presidency, a national parliament and regional and local posts.
Those in the Serb-run area also voted for their president.
	   OSCE has refused to release any returns, citing a complicated
ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the need for
accuracy. Western officials have admitted Plavsic is trailing in
the Bosnian Serb presidential race, although they have not said how
many ballots remain to be counted.
	   Faced with the prospect of an extremist victory, Gelbard
stressed U.S. aid depended on the respect of democracy and
commitment to the 1995 peace deal that envisages a unified Bosnia,
not the person in power.
	   ``What we are interested in is, whoever is in power, that they
implement the Dayton agreement,'' he said after meeting Plavsic.
``If they do, we will support them. If they do not, they will get
no support from the U.S., including economic support.''
	   ``If some had become converted in supporting the implementation
of then Dayton agreement then we are happy,'' he added.
	   The nationalists have been celebrating their self-declared
triumph since Sunday raising tensions among the rival Bosnian Serb
camps. As Gelbard spoke a few dozen nationalists drove through
Banja Luka streets, waving Serbian nationalist flags and blasting
Serbian folk songs over loudspeakers.
	   International officials in Bosnia warned the nationalists
against such demonstrations Friday, hinting at possible punishment.
	   ``We are in the process of suggesting to the (Serb) Radical
party and to Mr. Poplasen that it would not be in his interest to
have these demonstrations,'' said Robert Barry, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe office here.
	   Barry said that if protests continue, ``we will have to take
them into account in terms of our reaction.'' The OSCE has the
authority to disqualify candidates who violate campaign rules.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said the organization has decided
to put off until next week a decision whether to punish Poplasen
and his Radical Party for election violations.
	   Szulc said that since the end of the elections, OSCE staff has
been exposed to threats, harassment and intimidation from the Serb
hard-liners.
	   But Western officials fear that disqualifying Poplasen could
trigger a violent reaction among his followers. Bosnian Serbs have
urged OSCE to release results, although Barry's office said that
could take another five or six days.
	   A Plavsic ally, Milorad Dodik, urged the OSCE to disqualify
Poplasen for granting an interview to Serb television after the
deadline for such broadcasts.
	   Dodik, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic, said he
was willing to accept disqualification for his own breach of the
rules _ giving an interview to a local newspaper after the
deadline.
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists. Despite
millions of dollars in Western aid, little has trickled down to
rural Bosnian Serbs.
	   Radicalism may have been rekindled because of the clashes in the
Serbian province of Kosovo against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians
and the resulting Western pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.

	   KRIVOLAK, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO and its partner countries ended
a 26-nation exercise Friday in the neighborhood of Serbia's
troubled province of Kosovo, and its commanders declared success.
	   ``We have successfully gathered 26 nations here and I can say we
had a very good exercise,'' said Canadian Col. Frederick
Noseworthy, a commander in the exercise.
	   Among the 1,300 soldiers who took part in the week-long exercise
on the former Yugoslav Army military training grounds were about 20
U.S. troops. Troops from 13 other NATO and 13 non-NATO countries
also participated.
	   NATO officials present at the exercises insisted that the show
of allied and partner military capabilities had nothing to do with
the situation in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are
struggling for independence from the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   But when NATO foreign ministers announced exercises in Albania
and Macedonia last June, they said it was a part of their response
to the aggressive tactics of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who has used police and military force against the Albanian
separatists.
	   According to NATO officials, the aim of the exercise _ dubbed
``The Best Cooperative Effort 98'' _ was to train the armed forces
of the participating nations in the specific kinds of problems they
would face in a peacekeeping operation.

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) -- Queen Elizabeth II slipped
off her white pumps and strayed from the royal red carpet Friday in
Brunei, bending to chat with delighted schoolgirls in their pink
Muslim head scarves as they studied the Koran.
	   The queen tossed bits of Buckingham Palace protocol on the
second day of her visit to this tiny oil-rich sultanate on the
northern tip of Borneo. Yet the majesty befitting two of the
world's longest-ruling dynasties prevailed.
	   Friday morning, the queen removed her shoes, donned a
floor-length white prayer robe designed for her back in London, and
toured the Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque.
	   In the cavernous male prayer room, some 150 men sat
crossed-legged on their golden prayer rugs in identical black felt
``songkok'' caps and embroidered sarongs as the queen strolled
behind them in her stocking feet.
	   Her gloved hands clasped, white handbag dangling from her arm,
the queen softly inquired about the Arabic calligraphy of Koranic
verse carved into the white Italian marble.
	   The mosque, with its 29 marble domes and 29 white marble steps,
represents the 29th sultan in the 600-year-old Bolkiah dynasty.
	   The queen, herself the head of the 1,000-year British monarchy,
walked through the lower courtyard to visit hundreds of children
kneeled in front of wooden stands cradling tiny Korans. She tiptoed
off the red carpet and, in the widely admired style of the late
Princess Diana, chatted with a few of the girls.
	   ``I saw not just a beautiful building but the people gathering
for Friday prayers, the Muslim community coming together in
observance of one of the Five Pillars of that greater building
which is the Islamic faith,'' the queen said later during the state
banquet at the sultan's opulent palace, said to be the largest in
the world.
	   Wearing the Queen Mary tiara and a white satin gown embroidered
with diamonds and pearls, the queen sat next to Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah and his two wives dressed in traditional Malay silk robes.
Gifts and speeches were exchanged as some 300 guests under
glittering chandeliers dined on quail consomme and lentils in
coconut cream.
	   It was second nature for the sultan, estimated by Fortune
magazine to have a personal fortune of dlrs 37 billion, making him
one of the richest men in the world.
	   The sultan, wearing red and black military dress, in his speech
vowed to do his part to help bring Southeast Asia out of its
economic slump.
	   ``I am confident we can emerge stronger from the recent
financial storm that has struck us all,'' he said.
	   Though Brunei is one of the world's wealthiest countries -- its
312,000 people pay no taxes and medical care and education are free
-- the kingdom has been affected by the Asian contagion.
	   With the global plunge in the price of oil, which generates 80
percent of Brunei's wealth, the sultanate last month formed an
unprecedented special commission to study ways to revamp its
economy.
	   Like the British royal family, the Bolkiah clan also has its
private woes. The absolute monarchy is embroiled in a family feud
that is believed to have caused the collapse of its international
flagship company, Amadeo, and the loss of some dlrs 16 billion.
	   The company was run by the sultan's jet-setting younger brother,
Prince Jefri, who has since been sacked and remains in self-imposed
exile.
	   The queen was apparently greatly impressed by a compulsory
premarital counseling class she visited at the mosque.
	   The Church of England does not require marriage counseling. The
children of the royal couple, who celebrated their 50th wedding
anniversary last year, have been plagued by divorce.
	   ``She was jumping up and down, she was so excited,'' said Zaini
Ali, the mosque's architect, who escorted the queen.
	   He said the queen turned to accompanying British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook and said, ``We should try something like
this.''
	   Cook and his new wife, Gaynor Regan, were among the queen's
entourage at the mosque. The British tabloids have skewered Cook
for recently leaving his wife of 28 years and marrying a former
aide.

Kohl's Internet chat is unusual interface with German voters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl's idea of campaigning is a few
handshakes and a long speech, but the chancellor gave voters a rare
chance to interact with him for more than an hour Friday in an
Internet question-and-answer session.
	   For a nation often kept at arm's length by its top politicians,
the event was more remarkable than Kohl's polite replies, mostly
blurbs from his campaign for re-election on Sept. 27.
	   Even so, the cyberchat had an air of spontaneity _ including
biting humor about Kohl _ that the German election race otherwise
lacks.
	   Granted, opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder has run a glossy
campaign complete with theme song and a victor's smile. It's
prompted much talk of an American-style campaign _ yet his stump
speeches seem canned, hardly tailored to regional differences as he
hustles from town to town.
	   Meanwhile, Kohl's rambling speeches sometimes seem beside the
point. In former communist East Germany, where many jobs have
simply vanished, he insisted on telling an audience that people
must be ready to take low-paid work.
	   With Kohl refusing to debate Schroeder on television, the
contest between the two candidates has failed to generate sparks.
And Schroeder has openly said he would seek only moderate change if
elected, underlining the high priority Germans have given to
political continuity since World War II.
	   Schroeder spent the day campaigning conventionally, with indoor
rallies in two southwestern German cities on his schedule Friday
night.
	   Kohl's challenger went on the Internet already last April after
his nomination, but he only read answers to preselected questions
on a video link.
	   In contrast, Friday's cyberspace discussion turned anarchic at
times when the computer rented by Kohl's Christian Democratic party
temporarily crashed.
	   ``Where's the chancellor?'' asked an exasperated Internet user.
	   Others complained that the session wasn't so free-wheeling after
all because the party's Internet page managers were quickly killing
out critical questions.
	   Kohl did give 17 replies, including a promise he was ``not
planning'' to raise the main national sales tax and did not intend
to seek office again in 2002.
	   The man who once confused the information superhighway with
Germany's autobahn expressways signed off after 73 minutes, with a
pitch for voters to cast their ballot thoughtfully.
	   ``I have enjoyed discussing with you,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, I must now take up my other engagements.''

Parliament strips arrest immunity of opposition leader

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's parliament voted overwhelmingly
Friday to lift the immunity of former President Sali Berisha,
clearing the way for his arrest and prosecution for allegedly
trying to overthrow the government during this week's riots.
	   It was unclear whether the government would serve an arrest
warrant, a move that could trigger more violence from Berisha's
outraged supporters in this poor Balkan country.
	   Berisha's followers have been demanding President Fatos Nano
resign since last weekend's killing of popular opposition figure
Azem Hajdari. His death set off rioting Sunday and Monday, in which
mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television and
Nano's office.
	   International officials have been urging Nano's government to
move slowly against Berisha and allow a ``cooling off'' period
after the rioting, which brought Albania to the brink of anarchy
for the second time in 18 months.
	   The charge against Berisha carries the death penalty, although
Albania has stopped executions under an agreement with other
European nations.
	   Before the vote, Berisha told about 3,000 people Friday in
central Skanderbeg Square that he would continue to oppose Nano's
government, even from jail. ``I'm ready to accept any sacrifice,''
he said.
	   Lawmakers from Berisha's Democratic Party boycotted the vote.
The measure to lift his immunity passed 108-0 with five ballots
declared invalid. Forty-two delegates were absent. Berisha's
Democrats won 28 of the 155 parliamentary seats in the June 1997
election but have rarely attended any sessions.
	   The vote took place while another rally by chanting Berisha
supporters _ carrying flags and English-language signs _ ended
peacefully. One sign described Nano as the son of Albania's
longtime Stalinist dictator, Enver Hoxha.
	   It was the third straight day of peaceful rallies, but the small
number of protesters showed Berisha's inability to mount
significant support in the capital. There were no immediate reports
of protests elsewhere, despite Berisha's call for nationwide
demonstrations.
	   President Rexhep Meidani and international officials had
appealed for calm, with Daan Everts, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe ambassador, calling for people to stay
home Friday.
	   Armed police, some wearing black hoods, turned back vehicles at
a roadblock outside the capital.
	   Meidani has been working to find a way out of the crisis, which
Western powers fear will spread instability in the already volatile
Balkans. Berisha has openly supported Albanian rebels fighting for
independence in neighboring Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
	   The rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged
the parliament and prime minister's office. Three people died and
scores were injured.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of months of anarchy
last year following the collapse of pyramid schemes, which cost
many people their life's savings. Berisha was president during the
crisis and lost elections in its aftermath.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy.

Australian winger faces visa problems in English rugby debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian rugby league star Wendall Sailor has
been refused a work permit to play rugby union in England, throwing
into doubt his 100,000 (dlrs 168,000) short-term contract with
Leeds.
	   The Rugby Football Union released a statement Friday saying the
Overseas Labor Service ruled that the Kangaroo winger was not
eligible to obtain a work permit to play rugby union in England,
Wales or Scotland.
	   The 24-year-old Brisbane Broncos star, rated the best winger in
rugby league, was due to arrive in England before Oct. 21 to take
up a contract to play rugby league and rugby union for Leeds.
	   In July he accepted a deal with the Leeds Rugby Club, which
embraces the Leeds Tykes second division rugby union team and the
Leeds Rhinos Super League team, to play both codes for the club.
	   The Brisbane Broncos had released Sailor to play in England for
four months, after the Australian National Rugby League grandfinal
and before pre-season training commences in January.
	   RFU spokesman Terry Burwell said he was urgently seeking
discussions with all parites to review present criteria to
encompass flexibility to allow work permits to play union to be
issued in special cases.
	   ``The RFU acknowledges the potential a player of Wendall
Sailor's quality may bring to the game in England,'' Burwell said.
	   ``However, because the criteria for the issue fo work permits is
a mater for the OSL in consultation with the RFU, the Welsh Rugby
Union and the Scottish Rugby Union, the RFU cannot recommend an
exception at this time.''
	   Earlier this week, Sailor was forced to assure Leeds that he
would arrive in England in October after it was revealed he faced
assault charges in court the day he was scheduled to fly out of
Australia.

Hamas supporters clash with Israeli troops; 32 injured

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during the two-day
Jewish Near Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the
group's bomb makers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, the crowd stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement. Troops fired rubber
bullets, injuring 32 Palestinians, including one who was in serious
condition with a chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross told
Palestinian negotiators Friday he was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Ross held a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. After the meeting a senior Palestinian official told The
Associated Press some progress had been made.
	   ``Mr Ross managed to bridge the gaps on some issues,'' said
Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving Saturday for Washington to brief U.S. President Bill
Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on a U.S. proposal
for the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on
militants.

Stocks little changed on Wall Street as markets seek return to

stability &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Dow off slightly and broader
indicators mixed in the afternoon, closing European markets. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stock prices were little changed on Wall Street
Friday following a selling spree that swept markets worldwide
Thursday and was extended in Europe and most of Asia.
	   In an exception to the overseas losses, Tokyo's main stock index
managed a small rebound from Thursday's 12-year low.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.49 at 7,865.28 in
heavy trading by early afternoon while broader indicators were
mixed.
	   Trading was in a relatively narrow range, with the Dow up as
much as 56.90 in the early going, then falling to a loss of as much
as 39.65 before recovering some lost ground.
	   The dip left the Dow a little further below where it began the
year, at 7,908.25, and more than 15 percent beneath its July 17
record high of 9,337.97.
	   The Dow plunged 216.01 points, or by 2.7 percent, on Thursday as
stocks skidded around the world on fears not enough was being done
to prevent economic crises in Asia and Russia from worsening. Dire
profit projections from several major international companies added
to the pessimism.
	   Brokers said the selling was touched off by disappointment that
central bankers in the world's richest nations, especially the
United States, have not moved to lower interest rates to stimulate
economic activity.
	   ``The market was bullish'' earlier this week amid hopes of a
U.S. interest rate cut, said Philip Niem, an analyst with HSBC
Securities. But these hopes have been dashed by U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent comments.
	   Adding to the volatility of U.S. markets this week is Friday's
expiration of options and futures contracts on stocks and options
on stock indexes, a quarterly event in the United States known as
``triple-witching'' day.
	   The Japanese stock market's major index finished up 0.9 percent,
however, bouncing back from its lowest finish since March 5, 1986.
	   Tokyo stocks were bolstered by expectations Japan's ruling and
opposition parties would reach a compromise on banking reform in
time for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States
next week. After the Tokyo market closed, an agreement was
announced between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the main
opposition parties.
	   Market indicators fell 7.5 percent in the Philippines, 4.8
percent in Indonesia, 3 percent in Singapore and 1.7 percent in
Hong Kong.
	   In Europe, the main index in London closed down 1.5 percent, as
did shares at Frankfurt, Germany. In Paris, where stocks swooned
5.5 percent Thursday, the main index fell an additional 1.7
percent.

Spanish customs agents seize dlrs 7 million in hash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Customs agents seized 4,000 kilos (4.4
tons) of hashish worth about dlrs 7 million aboard a fishing boat
after a high-seas chase off southern Spain, authorities said
Friday.
	   They arrested three people aboard the boat and eight others in
the Mediterranean towns of Fuengirola and Cartagena, National
Police spokesman Jose Maria Seara said.
	   Customs agents followed the boat as it headed back to Spain from
Morocco, where it had loaded the hashish.
	   Agents boarded the vessel Thursday night about 35 miles off the
southern town of Almeria after a chase during which the two crew
members of the boat started to throw bails of hashish into the sea.
	   Authorities found about 1,000 kilos (1.1 tons) of it in the
water, national police spokesman.

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ The execution of 18 adults and children
left neighbors wondering why people seemingly so peaceful and
well-liked were shot to death by a criminal firing squad.
	   Some speculated the answer would be found in the drug trade and
related gunbattles that have swept northern Mexico, but prosecutors
withheld judgment.
	   ``We cannot say 100 percent that it was an aspect of drug
trafficking or for some other motive,'' the attorney general of
Baja California state, Marco Antonio de la Fuente Villarreal, said
at a news conference Thursday, hours after the massacre.
	   The New York Times on Friday, however, quoted federal Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo as saying that Fermin Castro was suspected of
being an associate of a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix drug gang.
	   Officials said Friday that they had made no arrests but had some
leads. A 15-year-old girl who survived the attack by hiding under a
bed was under treatment for shock.
	   Gunmen lined the victims against a wall, made them lie face-down
and shot them before dawn.
	   The three families appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed
up; most of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all.
	   The brutality of the killings prompted fear and outrage.
	   ``They are savages,'' barked Hugo Rodriguez, a fisherman who
lives a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the sprawling ranch compound
where the bodies of nine adults, two teen-agers, six children and a
baby were found.
	   Rodriguez noted that Mexico's most violent drug trafficking
cartel, the Arellano Felix brothers, ``has spread fear and terror''
in Baja California.
	   Earlier in the day, the government news agency Notimex quoted
the attorney general as saying Fermin Castro, who was seriously
injured in the attack, was suspected of growing marijuana for the
Arellano Felix gang based in Tijuana, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
north.
	   Of the 20 people lined against the wall, only Castro and a
teen-aged boy survived. The boy was in critical condition Friday at
a local hospital, state authorities said.
	   Another person also was listed as wounded, but it was unclear
whether that person was the 15-year-old girl, whom authorities said
was treated for shock, or another shooting victim.
	   State government officials initially had listed Castro among the
dead and gave the death toll at 19. But government spokesman Juan
Ruiz Contreras said Friday that was a mistake, and that Castro
remained in a coma.
	   Police said Castro had been under police investigation in the
past for reasons they would not disclose.
	   ``He was involved in something,'' said federal highway police
Capt. Fernando Rodriguez Goni, implying ``something'' illegal.
	   The New York Times on Friday quoted federal Attorney General
Jorge Madrazo as saying that Fermin Castro ``was suspected of being
an associate of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the
Arellano Felix organization.''
	   Higueras has been using Ensenada as a trafficking base, it
quoted Madrazo as saying in an interview. Madrazo's office did not
immediately respond to requests for confirmation.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   About two dozen horses whinnied and pigs grunted at the
compound, where a late-model Jeep Cherokee and several flatbed
trucks with the slogan ``El Indio Rodeo'' after Castro's nickname,
``The Indian,'' were parked.
	   Maria del Rosario Zavala looked anxiously toward the compound
from her house 200 yards down a dirt road in this sparse settlement
outside of Ensenada, a popular Baja California resort a 1{-hour
drive south of San Diego.
	   ``They helped a lot of people,'' she said.

Woosnam takes lead as Spanish teenager challenges superstars

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) - Ian Woosnam edged toward
his first European Tour win of 1998 Friday, firing a 4-under par 67
to take a one-shot lead in the second round of the pounds 800,000
(dlrs 1.32 million) Lancome Trophy.
	   Beginning the day 3-under par, the Welshman shot six birdies and
two bogeys to end the round 7-under, two ahead of the field.
	   Woosnam, who won the last of his 28 European titles in May 1997,
is looking to improve his putting over the next two days.
	   ``I am tense over the putts,'' Woosnam, winner here in 1987 and
1993, said. ''Tee to green I am playing great. I am in a good
position and have some good results over this course.''
	   ``If I get my confidence back when I'm putting I don't think a
victory is very far away.''
	   Visitors to the par-71, 6,311 meter (6,903-yard) course in
Saint-Nom-La-Breteche, west of Paris, also saw a fine 68 from
Spanish amateur Sergio Garcia.
	   The 18-year-old, still at school in his home town of Castellon,
lies equal third on 5-under par - five shots ahead of his boyhood
idol, Seve Ballesteros.
	   ``Seve is my hero,'' Garcia said. ``But I am going for the
victory. There are great players here, but I think I can win.''
	   Garcia said that he plans to turn pro - but only after he has
played in next April's U.S. Masters, which he qualified for by
winning the British amateur championship.
	   After a double bogey on the 4th, defending champion Mark O'Meara
stormed back with four successive birdies to end the day 5-under.
	   ``The double bogey at No.4 woke me up a bit,'' the American
said. ``With my confidence at the moment it is easier to forget a
bad hole.''
	   Also at 5-under is Colin Montgomerie, looking to end the year as
European No. 1 for the sixth time in succession.
	   Despite some impressive putting, the big Scotsman was downbeat.
	   ``I'm not happy at all. I am playing very poorly and hitting to
the left all the time,'' he said. ``I struggled to make par on
three birdie holes. I have to practice to get the hook out of my
system.''

Burmese refugees stage protest against military rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 50 Burmese men, women and
children demonstrated in the capital on Friday against military
rule in their country.
	   The protesters, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh over the
years, waved placards that read ``We want restoration of democracy
in Burma.''
	   The demonstration was staged to mark the 10th anniversary of the
seizure of power by military generals in Maynmar, formerly Burma.
	   ``We want the military to hand over power to our National League
for Democracy which won the elections in 1990,'' Ani Maung, a
protest leader said.
	   In Dhaka the refugees are looked after by the United Nations.

Russian Central Bank to pump more money into the economy
</HEADLINE>

analysts, other details. Trims. CHANGES byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank announced plans Friday to start
printing money to prevent the economy from spinning out of control,
despite warnings the move could mean a return to Soviet-style
restrictions.
	   The government wants to fill the economy with enough money to
ensure the nation's debt-ridden banking system does not fail, and
to pay off many months' backlog of wages to state workers and
pensioners.
	   But the debts are huge, and economists warned that pumping that
much money into the economy could lead to hyperinflation. To
prevent that, they said, the government would have to introduce
price controls, establish an artificial exchange rate and impose
tight controls over export revenues.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the government might have
to revert to command methods to restore economic stability.
	   ``We don't rule out using administrative measures. In the near
future we plan to introduce a number of additional measures to
regulate the foreign exchange market, and to tighten control over
foreign-exchange transactions,'' Primakov told reporters.
	   Analysts warned the government's strategy could mean
Soviet-style economic controls.
	   ``Once you start printing money, you have to do many other
horrible things, and then it's very difficult to stop it,'' said
Pavrolata Shtereva, fixed-income strategist at MFK Renaissance bank
in Moscow.
	   Primakov sought to assure foreign investors that Moscow will
meet its obligations. At the same time, he urged western lenders to
fulfill their promises of aid to Russia.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which put together a dlrs 22.6
billion aid package to Russia this summer, said the next infusion
of money would be postponed until the government resumes market
reforms.
	   The government has yet to reveal a comprehensive program.
	   The government is still trying to raise funds by improving tax
collections. Tax collections for August added up to 11.2 billion
rubles _ 1 billion rubles less than in July, and 2 billion rubles
less than planned, the report said.
	   Tax service chief Boris Fyodorov said many companies were not
paying because they could not get their money out of idled banks.
The economic crisis has caused bank activities such as money
transfers to come to a virtual standstill.
	   Other companies were simply stalling with their tax payments, as
political uncertainty prompts speculation that the tax service will
relax its efforts, Fyodorov said.
	   Primakov said that the government plans to introduce a monopoly
on the alcohol and tobacco markets, in order to secure revenues for
the federal budget. He pledged the government ``will get rid of
corruption and bribery once and for all.''
	   The Central Bank announced it would lower reserve requirements
for banks in a relatively sound financial position. That means the
banks wouldn't have to keep as much money on hand, and could settle
debts, improving the overall liquidity in the financial markets.
	   The Central Bank also plans to redeem treasury bills with
maturities through Dec. 31, 1998, from selected Russian banks.
Those treasuries had been frozen by the Central Bank last month.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the Central Bank first deputy chairman, said the
bank would print money to pay for some treasury bills. Kozlov
wouldn't say how much money would be printed, but stressed it would
be strictly limited.
	   Fears of inflation caused the the ruble to drop again Friday,
from the official rate of 14.60 rubles to the dollar announced by
the Central Bank on Thursday night to 16.38 on Friday night. It
fell even further in trading between banks, reaching about 18.5
rubles to the dollar on Friday.
	   Russian stocks sank in thin trading Friday, with investors
unwilling to take part in trading while the new Cabinet's economic
policies remain unclear. The Russian Trading System Index fell 5.1
percent by the end of the day, to close at 50.12 points, from 52.31
points Thursday.
	   Russia's industrial output is also shrinking. After showing
signs of modest growth at the end of last year, it was 11.5 percent
lower this August than during the same period last year _ the
sharpest drop since 1994, the State Statistics Committee said,
according to Interfax.

Italy busts alleged art forgery ring specializing in fake
</HEADLINE>
Modigliani &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEGHORN, Italy (AP) _ Italian police said Friday they had broken
an art forgery ring that had profited for years on the faking and
selling of paintings by modern artists, specializing in Modigliani.
	   Authorities have charged 16 people with counterfeiting and
seized 115 faked works _ most already sold _ with a value of nearly
dlrs 5 million, police Capt. Adolfo Rufa said.
	   The forgery ring was based in the Tuscan coastal city of Leghorn
and apparently had been operating since the mid-1980s, Rufa said.
	   The investigation started in 1996 after an art expert
discredited a purported Modigliani sketch _ accompanied by a faked
certificate of authenticity _ for which a collector had paid more
than dlrs 20,000, police said.
	   The seized works included 18 pictures and a sculpture by Amedeo
Modigliani, whose paintings are most recognizable for the
gracefully elongated necks and faces of his subjects.
	   ``Modigliani is very easy to counterfeit, more than others,''
Rufa said.
	   The other works were by Picasso and lesser-known artists such as
Guttoso and De Chirico.
	   Most were seized in Leghorn _ Modigliani's hometown _ and other
Tuscan cities; others were confiscated in Rome, Turin and Milan.

Pope opens 3-day pastoral trip in Italy

<TEXT>
	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ Pope John Paul II opened a three-day
pastoral trip in Italy on Friday in the little diocese of an old
hiking companion.
	   The sleepy resort town of Chiavari was abuzz for hours, even
before the pope arrived by helicopter on Friday afternoon.
	   Crowds of people thronged its streets and shopkeepers festooned
their windows with yellow-and-white papal flags. Special trains and
buses were laid on to bring in pilgrims, and local artisans labored
over an altar in the shape of a boat.
	   A town of only 28,000 on the Italian Riviera south of the port
city of Genoa, Chiavari is unused to such excitement.
	   But its bishop, Alberto Careggio, is an old friend of the
pontiff and for years helped organize John Paul's summer vacations
in the Italian Alps.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff is well-known as a world traveler, but
he also makes pastoral visits inside Italy and to parish churches
in Rome, where he is the bishop.
	   On Saturday, the pope's schedule includes a seaside Mass in
Chiavari before he flies to his next stop, Brescia near Lake Garda.
He returns to Rome on Sunday.

 &UR; American Airlines, British Airways may have new alliance plans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways have yet to
get their controversial planned alliance off the ground, but they
could be on the verge of announcing an even wider global
arrangement, reports indicated Friday.
	   American chief executive Don Carty and British Airways chief
executive Bob Ayling called a news conference Monday to discuss a
``major worldwide airline initiative.''
	   Published reports have indicated partners from Canada, Australia
and Hong Kong could be part of the plan.
	   Neither American nor British Airways would comment on their
strategy, although one industry executive said privately late
Friday that ``lots of people will be there.''
	   The Australian Associated Press reported from Sydney that Cathay
Pacific Airways, the Hong Kong-based carrier, would join forces
with American and British Airways.
	   Meanwhile, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, from the Texas city
where American is based, has reported that the deal could give
American and British Airways closer ties to their marketing
partners Canadian Airlines International and Qantas Airways, of
Australia.
	   A broad alliance could be similar to the deal arranged by United
Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines. They formed a group called
the Star Alliance with other partners including Thai Airways, Air
Canada, Scandinavian Airlines System and the Brazilian carrier
Varig.
	   The partner airlines try to coordinate their flight schedules
and offer incentives to travelers such as the ability to collect
frequent flyer miles on any of the flights taken on any of the
partners.
	   American and British Airways are still fighting to win
regulatory approval of a transatlantic alliance that has been
widely criticized by other carriers.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Juli Inkster nearly aced the 16th hole and
Dottie Pepper followed by tapping in the 1 1-2-meter (5-foot)
birdie putt to get United States off to a 3-1 lead over Europe
after Friday's morning matches at the Solheim Cup.
	   ``You hope to get on the board first like we did,'' Pepper said
near the 17th green. ``The team wants to know what's happening in
front of them.''
	   Inkster and Pepper's victory set the pace for the U.S. squad.
	   After the Europeans conceded the 17th hole and the match, the
large partisan crowd circling the green shouted, ``U-S-A!'' Inkster
smiled and raised her fist to the gallery while Pepper tipped her
visor and waved.
	   Pepper and Inkster led by four holes at the turn, but the
European team of Laura Davies and Trish Johnson narrowed the
deficit to one with a birdie at the par-5 15th.
	   After Pepper sunk the putt to put the United States 2-up with
two to play, Davies hit her drive on the 17th hole right and under
a pine tree. Pepper's drive was in the middle of the fairway.
	   Her swing restricted by the branches, Johnson had to take a
slash at the ball to knock it backwards about 20 meters. Davies
then hit a tree with the European side's third shot. Before Inkster
could hit the American's approach to the par-4 hole, the Europeans
conceded the hole and the match.
	   The United States won two other matches and Annika Sorenstam led
the way for the Europeans in the fourth of the alternate-shots
matches.
	   Meg Mallon and Brandie Burton defeated Helen Alfredsson and
Alison Nicholas 3 and 1, while Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst beat
Lisa Hackney and Liselotte Neumann 1-up.
	   Sorenstam, who leads the world rankings, led the way as Europe
picked up its only point of the morning matches. Paired with
Solheim rookie Catriona Matthew, Sorenstam repeatedly hit critical
shots and putts as Europe beat the U.S. team of Donna Andrews and
Tammie Green, 3 and 2.
	   Green is 6 months pregnant and was followed around the course by
her obstetrician.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian parliament voted
overwhelmingly Friday to lift the immunity of former President Sali
Berisha, clearing the way for his arrest and prosecution for
allegely trying to overthrow the government during this week's
riots.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the government would soon
attempt to serve an arrest warrant, a move which could trigger more
violent unrest from radicalized supporters.
	   ``I'll continue the battle from whatever cell they put me in,''
Berisha told reporters after the parliament action. ``I have
decided to resist. I have decided not to negotiate.''

Chained wild elephants pose South African dilemma

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Until last month, the 30 young
elephants roamed free with their families along the Limpopo River
in neighboring Botswana.
	   Now, at a wildlife export farm near Pretoria, chains bite into
their legs, causing the animals to trumpet in distress, says a
wildlife investigator who saw them last month. The exporter,
African Game Services, is taming the elephants for zoos, safari
parks in China, elephant-back safaris and even menial labor.
	   The fate of the beasts has divided animal lovers and highlights
Africa's quandary about a species still listed as endangered yet
growing by 7 percent a year: What to do with elephants destroying
the landscape and crops that sustain the human population.
	   ``I've seen circus animals tethered to the ground, but it was
not half as brutal as what was going on there,'' said Rick Allan of
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the
policing agency for animal protection laws.
	   Allan said he would file animal cruelty charges in court next
week.
	   African Game Services bought the 30 elephants for 12,000 rand
(dlrs 2,000) each from Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve, a
private organization of 19 landowners and tourist lodges.
	   The landowners had an ecological crisis on their hands.
	   After they invested millions of dollars to reclaim former cattle
ranches for a private wildlife reserve, an aerial game survey
showed the land contained four times the number of elephants it
could support.
	   The animals had decimated some tree species, and had wandered
across the Limpopo into South Africa, where the provincial
administration issued hunting permits to limit crop damage, said
Ted Steyn, chairman of the landowners' group.
	   ``We have been trying for a decade to find destinations for
family elephant units,'' Steyn said. ``But we've just not had
success.''
	   In their three-day roundup in early August, African Game
Services herded mothers and other family members with helicopters
to separate out 5-to-10-year old elephants. The Botswana Department
of Wildlife and National Parks approved the sale.
	   The elephants' handling has unleashed a raft of condemnations
from abroad, including internationally known elephant behavioral
experts Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole in Kenya.
	   After pictures of the chained elephants appeared in the local
press, South African animal experts got worried, too.
	   But instead of condemning African Game Services they decided to
help the company negotiate the controversy and through a new
committee, develop standards for elephant training as one
alternative to dealing with the bursting population.
	   Panel members include the Rhino and Elephant Foundation, the
local U.N. Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and
the Department of Agriculture.
	   Marion Garais, chairwoman of the Elephant Management and Owners'
Association and committee member, said she found the animal
exporter had no alternative to chaining.
	   ``Cruelty is subjective,'' she said. ``It's not nice to chain an
elephant but zoos and circuses chain them too.''
	   The money from the elephant sale will help build a fence to
protect some of the farmers.
	   Using the Mahout-style training with long spiked hooks,
Indonesian tamers have already succeeded with one group and removed
the chains, said Riccardo Ghiazza, who owns the export business.
	   ``The restraining method must be used at first to avoid the
animals killing each other, or killing people,'' Ghiazza said in a
telephone interview.
	   Baby elephants who are nursing are no longer taken from their
mothers, he said.
	   But Kenya's Cynthia Moss says older offspring like the ones
being held near Pretoria are also dependent on close emotional
bonds with their mothers.

North Korea reports rescuing two Russian anglers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ North Korean border guards said Friday they had
rescued two Russian anglers in the Sea of Japan, Russia's ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The two Russians, who were not identified, were to be brought
back to their homeland on Saturday, the report said.
	   Russian rescue center captain Vyacheslav Bakanovich said the
anglers may be members of a group of students from the Far Eastern
city of Khabarovsk who had been on vacation in the coastal Primorye
region.
	   Two of the students _ a man and a woman _ have been missing
since they went fishing on an inflatable raft last Friday,
Bakanovich said, according to ITAR-Tass.

<TEXT>
	   At the heart of the church is an icon of the Virgin Mary painted
in 1493. The icon is credited with saving Chiavari from a cholera
epidemic in 1835.
	   The pope urged people to turn to Mary for comfort and to muster
the energy with which to ``renovate a society solid with justice
and love.''
	   This quiet little resort town on the Italian Riviera was abuzz
for hours even before the pope arrived.
	   Crowds of people thronged its streets and shopkeepers festooned
their windows with yellow-and-white papal flags. Special trains and
buses were laid on to bring in pilgrims, and local artisans labored
over an altar in the shape of a boat.
	   A town of only 28,000 south of the port city of Genoa, Chiavari
is unused to such excitement. But its bishop, Alberto Careggio, is
an old friend of the pontiff and for years helped organize John
Paul's summer vacations in the Italian Alps.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff is well-known as a world traveler, but
he also makes pastoral visits inside Italy and to parish churches
in Rome, where he is the bishop.
	   ``It gives me great joy every time I visit a local church,'' he
said Friday.
	   The pope planned to meet with local clergy, nuns, monks and
seminarians later in the day.
	   His schedule also includes a seaside Mass in Chiavari on
Saturday before he flies to his second stop, Brescia near Lake
Garda. He returns to Rome on Sunday.

EU commissioner says new Athens airport on track
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Athens' new international airport is
expected to be finished on time and before the 2004 Summer
Olympics, the European Union's transport commissioner said Friday.
	   Neil Kinnock said construction of the airport, which began in
September 1996, is already 37 percent completed.
	   Kinnock said he was positive that ``it will be 50 percent
finished at the end of the year'' and was satisfied that it was
``absolutely on schedule.''
	   The airport is to be completed by 2000 and is expected to handle
the majority of visitors attending the 2004 Games. Completion of
the airport, which is being built by a German consortium, was a
main selling point for Athens' bid.
	   Under construction in Spata, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast
of Athens, it will have an initial annual capacity of 16 million
passengers. It is expected to handle up to 600 flights daily and
220,000 tons of cargo a year.
	   The airport will be named after Eleftherios Venizelos, a prime
minister who dominated Greek politics before World War II.
	   The current beach front airport on outskirts of the capital is
expected to remain operational until the Olympics. It will then be
turned into a park.

Italy busts alleged art forgery ring specializing in fake

<TEXT>
	   LEGHORN, Italy (AP) _ Italian police said Friday they had broken
an art forgery ring that had profited for years on the faking and
selling of paintings by modern artists, specializing in Modigliani.
	   Authorities have charged 16 people with counterfeiting and
seized 115 faked works _ most already sold _ with a value of nearly
dlrs 5 million, police Capt. Adolfo Rufa said.
	   The forgery ring was based in the Tuscan coastal city of Leghorn
and apparently had been operating since the mid-1980s, Rufa said.
	   The investigation started in 1996 after an art expert
discredited a purported Modigliani sketch _ accompanied by a faked
certificate of authenticity _ for which a collector had paid more
than dlrs 20,000, police said.
	   The seized works included 18 pictures and a sculpture by Amedeo
Modigliani, whose paintings are most recognizable for the
gracefully elongated necks and faces of his subjects.
	   ``Modigliani is very easy to counterfeit, more than others,''
Rufa said.
	   The other works were by Picasso and lesser-known artists such as
Renato Guttuso and Giorgio De Chirico.
	   Most were seized in Leghorn _ Modigliani's hometown _ and other
Tuscan cities; others were confiscated in Rome, Turin and Milan.

Friday for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to resign, boldly
escalating a challenge to the man who has ruled the country for 17
years.
	   ``Dr. Mahathir has lost the people's support. The time has come
for him to step down,'' Anwar Ibrahim shouted to a crowd of at
least 80,000 packed into the bleachers and crammed onto the soccer
field of the Sultan Mohamad IV Stadium.
	   Thousands in this Islamic fundamentalist stronghold on the east
coast punched their fists into the air and screamed their support.
	   They ridiculed the 73-year-old Mahathir leader, and booed the
police chief, who twice approached Anwar to request he stop
speaking.
	   Such scenes are unheard of in Malaysia, where laws give the
government broad powers of arrest. Even the opposition parties have
not urged Mahathir to leave office or suggested he be investigated
for corruption, as Anwar did on Thursday and Friday.
	   Spectators made their way through an 8-kilometer (5-mile)
traffic jam to see Anwar, whom Mahathir once groomed as his
successor.
	   Anwar has been gathering support since the mercurial Mahathir
fired the deputy prime minister and finance minister Sept. 2 and
drummed him out of the ruling party.
	   Mahathir said that Anwar was morally unfit.
	   ``My greatest sin was to challenge Dr. Mahathir. His time is
over. He's old,'' said Anwar, as a few dozen in the crowd answered
back, ``He's senile.''
	   Anwar had gotten similar support from a smaller group of 5,000
in the government-party stronghold of Kuala Terengganu earlier in
the day. When he asked his hearers if they supported his call for
Mahathir to step down, hundreds shouted, ``We do.''
	   Five of Anwar's associates have been arrested as part of a
police investigation of him on allegations of sexual misconduct,
abuse of power, interfering in a police probe and leaking state
secrets.
	   Anwar denies the accusations and says they are motivated by the
political threat his popularity poses to Mahathir.
	   How much longer Mahathir will tolerate Anwar's challenge is the
top question in the streets.
	   The prime minister's public response has been tepid. On Friday
he criticized Anwar for appearing on opposition party platforms,
and on Thursday said that criticism of the judiciary is a ploy to
later claim an unfair trial.
	   Anwar says authorities are embarrassed to detain him before the
Commonwealth Games that end Sept. 21 and the visit of Queen
Elizabeth II, which ends Sept. 23.
	   Anwar said that on Sunday, the day the queen arrives, he would
speak in Merdeka Square in the center of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.

Syria says Arab-Turkish relations were better during Welfare

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria accused Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz on Friday of causing a rift with Arab states and
compared him unfavorably to his pro-Islamic predecessor.
	   ``The present deterioration in relations between Arabs and the
Turkish government is not caused by the Arabs,'' Syria's state-run
Damascus radio said in a commentary.
	   Syria criticized Yilmaz's visit to its arch-enemy, Israel, last
week. While in Jerusalem, Yilmaz told reporters: ``Frankly, I don't
care how Syria comments (on) my visit. Everyone is aware of the
hostile intentions of Syria on Turkey.''
	   On Wednesday, the chief of the Turkish army, Gen. Atilla Ates,
referred to Syria's alleged support for Kurdish separatists in
southeastern Turkey, saying ``our patience is running out.'' Turkey
has threatened to use force against Syria if it does not withdraw
its alleged backing for the insurgents.
	   Arab League foreign ministers condemned Turkey's military
alliance with Israel at a meeting in Cairo on Thursday.
	   On Friday, Damascus radio said the Turkish-Israeli military
alliance ``threatens Arab national security.''
	   ``Not long ago a former Turkish government extended its hand to
the Arabs and they in return extended two (hands),'' the broadcast
said.
	   The radio was referring to the pro-Islamic government of Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of the Welfare Party, which
held power from July 1996 to June 1997.
	   ``That (Welfare Party's) conduct was the best example for
purifying the present atmosphere, with its intention of being good
neighbors,'' the radio said.
	   However, Damascus radio appeared to have overlooked that one of
the two military agreements that form the basis of Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation was signed in August 1996 _ when Erbakan was
prime minister.
	   The agreement provided for an exchange of technical know-how.
The other agreement, signed in April 1996, allowed Israeli fighter
planes to use Turkish airspace.
	   Syria and other Arab states complained when Turkey signed the
military pacts with Israel, regarding Ankara's actions as a
betrayal of Muslim solidarity.
	   Before he came to power, Erbakan opposed Turkey's entering into
military agreement with Israel, but he changed his policy after
taking office.
	   In a crackdown on anti-secular politics, the Turkish
constitutional court banned the Welfare Party this year. It also
banned Erbakan from holding office for five years. The party has
reemerged as the Virtue Party.
	   Syria has long denied that it supports Kurdish rebels in Turkey,
who have been fighting for an independent state since 1984.

Australian winger faces permit problems in English rugby debut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: changes slug to permit, updates with Leeds quotes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian rugby league star Wendall Sailor has
been refused a work permit to play rugby union in England, throwing
into doubt his 100,000 pound (dlrs 168,000) short-term contract
with Leeds.
	   The Rugby Football Union released a statement Friday saying the
Overseas Labor Service ruled that the Kangaroo winger was not
eligible to obtain a work permit to play rugby union in England,
Wales or Scotland.
	   The 24-year-old Brisbane Broncos star, rated the best winger in
rugby league, was due to arrive in England before Oct. 21 to take
up a contract to play rugby league and rugby union for Leeds.
	   In July, he accepted a deal with the Leeds Rugby Club, which
embraces the Leeds Tykes second division rugby union team and the
Leeds Rhinos Super League team, to play both codes for the club.
	   Precedents exist in Sailor's case, which means the RFU should
reconsider, Leeds officials said Friday.
	   In the precedent, Newcastle Rugby Union club signed former All
Black Va'aiga Tuigamala from Wigan Rugby League club after
overcoming work permit obstacles.
	   Sailor fails to meet rugby union work permit criteria because he
has not played Rugby Union for Australia, but he meets rugby league
criteria.
	   Gary Hetherington, Leeds Rugby Club chief executive, said Sailor
would be a major attraction for rugby union, which has recently
turned professional
	   ``He would be a huge attraction to...the game in general and to
turn away a world superstar at a time when clubs like Leeds Tykes
are struggling to create a business to sustain professional rugby
would be very disappointing,'' he said.
	   The Brisbane Broncos had released Sailor to play in England for
four months, after the Australian National Rugby League grandfinal
and before pre-season training commences in January.
	   RFU spokesman Terry Burwell said he was urgently seeking
discussions with all parites to review present criteria to
encompass flexibility to allow work permits to play union to be
issued in special cases.
	   ``The RFU acknowledges the potential a player of Wendall
Sailor's quality may bring to the game in England,'' Burwell said.
	   ``However, because the criteria for the issue fo work permits is
a mater for the OSL in consultation with the RFU, the Welsh Rugby
Union and the Scottish Rugby Union, the RFU cannot recommend an
exception at this time.''
	   Earlier this week, Sailor was forced to assure Leeds that he
would arrive in England in October after it was revealed he faced
assault charges in court the day he was scheduled to fly out of
Australia.
	   Sailor is expected to play for Australia in two matches against
New Zealand, on Oct. 9 and Oct. 16. He is scheduled to arrive in
England in time to play for the Leeds Rhinos in the Super League
grand final on Oct. 24 if the rugby league team reaches the
premiership decider.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Heeding urgent calls from abroad to fix its
economy, Japan's prime minister surrendered to opposition demands
Friday on legislation to prevent banks from collapsing under
massive bad debts.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi leaves in two days for a summit in
New York with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and he has been eager to
break a deadlock with opposition parties on the bills package
before his departure.
	   The bills, seen as vital to prevent Japan from sinking further
into recession, seek to clean up some 80 trillion yen (dlrs 606
billion) in soured loans that are paralyzing the nation's banks and
threatening to send global markets on a tailspin.
	   ``As the country with the world's second-largest economy, I
determined that it wouldn't do for Japan to be the source of a
global meltdown,'' Obuchi said.
	   After two days of intense bargaining, Obuchi accepted the main
points of the opposition's counterproposal to the ruling party
plan.
	   The changes include stripping the Finance Ministry of crucial
powers to chart the country's financial course and nationalizing
the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   In addition, a 13 trillion-yen (dlrs 100 billion) pool of public
funds that had been set aside to prop up banks will be abolished.
	   In spite of the breakthrough, some analysts said the agreement
was too vague and open to interpretation.
	   ``Just having measures in place doesn't mean they'll be used
efficiently,'' James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The compromise plan does not answer the question of how much
taxpayer money will be used to mop up bad debt at ailing banks. It
also does not say if public funds can be used to inject capital
into weak banks.
	   But others said the legislation was likely to make Japan's banks
more responsible.
	   ``Rather than doing nothing and simply applying for a public
fund injection, banks will try to improve their conditions by
themselves,'' Nozomu Kunishige of Lehman Brothers Japan told Dow
Jones.
	   Under intense pressure from abroad and from Japanese voters,
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party desperately needed an agreement
on the bills.
	   With Friday's agreement, most of the bills are expected to pass
next month during the current parliament session.
	   Caving into opposition demands represents a humiliating setback
at home for Obuchi, whose approval ratings are sinking.
	   Naoto Kan, the popular leader of the main opposition Democratic
Party, was triumphant after the negotiations were over.
	   ``Today's agreement basically represents the total acceptance of
the (opposition) parties' proposals,'' Kan said.
	   Still, Obuchi told reporters he was happy to have the chance to
explain to Clinton Japan's strategy to stabilize its financial
sector.
	   In Washington, Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, said Friday that Clinton will use his meeting with Obuchi
to urge Japan to act quickly to repair its economy.
	   One of the biggest points of contention in the banking bills was
curtailing the powers of Japan's mighty Finance Ministry. The prime
minister agreed to opposition demands to transfer oversight of
financial markets from the ministry to a new committee by next
June.
	   Another was to let bad banks fail and limit the use of taxpayer
money to protect depositors and healthy borrowers.
	   The opposition, which controls enough seats in the upper house
of Japan's bicameral legislature to block the bills, had demanded
several significant changes to the initial proposal.
	   The debate came to a head over a ruling party proposal to spend
public funds to bail out cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   The prime minister gave into opposition demands and decided that
public money will be used to clean up the bank's bad loans only
after placing it under government control _ effectively proclaiming
it bankrupt.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian parliament voted
overwhelmingly Friday to lift the immunity of former President Sali
Berisha, clearing the way for his arrest on charges he tried to
overthrow the government.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the government would soon
attempt to serve an arrest warrant, a move which could trigger more
violent unrest from Berisha's radical supporters.
	   ``I'll continue the battle from whatever cell they put me in,''
Berisha told reporters after the parliament action. ``I have
decided to resist. I have decided not to negotiate.''
	   International officials have urged President Fatos Nano to move
slowly against Berisha and allow a ``cooling off'' period after two
days of rioting, which brought Albania to the brink of anarchy for
the second time in 18 months.
	   The crisis began with the killing Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha. The killing sparked riots
Sunday and Monday in the capital, Tirana. Three people died and
scores were injured. Berisha's supporters have demanded Nano's
resignation.
	   Before the vote, Berisha told about 3,000 people Friday in
central Skanderbeg Square that he would continue to oppose Nano's
government, even from jail.
	   ``I'm ready to accept any sacrifice,'' he said.
	   Charges of overthrowing the government carry the death penalty
upon conviction, although Albania has halted executions recently.
	   The vote to lift immunity was 108-0 with five ballots declared
invalid. Some 42 delegates, including all those from Berisha's
Democratic Party, were absent. The Democrats won 28 of the 155
parliamentary seats in the June 1997 election but have rarely
attended any sessions.
	   As the vote was taking place, another rally by Berisha
supporters ended peacefully. It was the third straight peaceful
rally, but the small number of protesters showed Berisha's
inability to mount significant support in the capital.
	   There were no immediate reports of protests elsewhere, despite
Berisha's call for nationwide demonstrations.
	   President Rexhep Meidani and international officials had
appealed for calm. Daan Everts, who heads the local office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, called for
people to stay home Friday ``so that they are not being misused for
political ends.''
	   Armed police turned back vehicles at a roadblock outside the
capital, allowing only those with Tirana license plates to proceed.
Police also stopped vehicles and searched for weapons on other
roads in Tirana.
	   Meidani has been working behind the scenes to find a way out of
the crisis, which Western powers fear will spread instability
further in the volatile Balkans. Berisha has openly supported
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence in neighboring
Kosovo province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government workers
who held positions during his five years in power but lost them
when Nano took over last year.
	   In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited outrage over
Hajdari's killing and widespread disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the economy and restore confidence
in the nation's future.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of months of anarchy
last year after the collapse of pyramid schemes, which cost many
people their life's savings. Berisha was president during the
crisis and lost elections in its aftermath.

	   The ruling party forged an agreement Friday with the opposition
on a key package of bills to deal with the massive bad debts in
Japan's banks. Among the main points of the plan:
	   _ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the country's
largest banks, will be temporarily put under state control.
	   _establishment of Japan's equivalent of the U.S. Resolution
Trust Corp., which was set up during America's savings and loan
crisis of the 1980s, to buy bad debt from troubled banks with
public funds by a March 2001 deadline.
	   _a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 100 billion) pool of public funds to
prop up banks, proposed by the governing party, was thrown out.
	   _a special committee will take powers away from the Finance
Ministry to set financial policy.

After international turmoil, central bank rises key rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ After four consecutive days of
intervention to suppport the krone, the central bank on Friday said
it will raise its floor discount and deposit rates by 0.5
percentage points each to 4.25 percent.
	   The reason for the rate hike was the current unrest in the
international markets, the Central Bank said in a statement, adding
it had forced them to sell ``foreign exchange to a significant
degree to stabilize the krone.''
	   A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the extent of krone
purchasing and the amount of foreign exchange selling.
	   The Nationalbanken also said it will lift its key securities
repurchase rate by one percentage point to 5 percent as of Monday.

BP boss pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum's chief executive, Sir John
Browne, has already acquired a reputation for being more
environmentally friendly than his competitors. On Friday, the Big
Oil boss got even greener by pledging sharp cuts in greenhouse
gases that the oil giant emits.
	   Browne told an audience at Yale University in New Haven,
Connecticut, that BP plans to cut its worldwide emission of
greenhouse gases by 10 percent by 2010, using its 1990 emission
levels as the starting point.
	   A BP spokesman in London said the company emitted 40 million
tons of carbon dioxide in 1990 and that number would have grown to
58 million tons by 2010 if BP did nothing.
	   Some of the cuts have already been made, for example as BP
reduced its ``flaring,'' or open burning of natural gas at some
wells. BP could not say what its current emission levels are.
	   The Environmental Defense Fund in the United States helped BP
develop its strategy.
	   EDF executive director Fred Krupp said that although BP's
customers around the world will still continue to release the bulk
of the greenhouse gas generated by fuels sold by the company,
Browne's commitment is a concrete step toward improving the
environment.
	   Krupp noted that other big oil companies are still fighting
measures to reduce greenhouse gases, while BP has pledged cuts even
deeper than those agreed at an international environmental summit
in Kyodo, Japan.
	   ``That's setting a whole new standard for what it means to be a
responsible corporation,'' Krupp said by telephone from New York.

Russian wins 13th leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SABINANIGO, Spain (AP) _ Andrei Zintchenko of Russia gave
Vitalicio Seguros its first win of this year's Tour of Spain on
Friday, taking the 13th leg after riding alone for nearly 90
kilometers (55 miles).
	   Abraham Olano of Banesto remained the overall leader, with
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank in second place
and Fernando Escartin, of Spain and Kelme Costa-Blanca, in third.
	   These frontrunners appear to be saving their strength for the
last week of the 22-stage tour, which includes several legs in the
mountains outside Madrid, and a key time-trial in the town of
Fuenlabrada.
	   Zintchenko took 5 hours, 7 minutes and 12 seconds to cover a
208- kilometer (130-mile) trek that began and ended in this
northern town.
	   Second place went to Belgian Ludo Dierckxens of Lotto-Mobistar
and third to Unai Etxebarria of Euskatel-Euskadi. Both were
credited as coming in 2 minutes and 20 seconds after the Russian.
	   The gaffe of the day went to Alexandre Moos of Switzerland and
Saeco, who pulled away from the pack with three kilometers (two
miles) to go and raised his arms as he crossed the finish line,
thinking he'd won. He actually finished sixth, 3 minutes and 29
seconds behind Zintchenko.
	   Saturday's 14th leg covers 145.5 kilometers (91 miles) from
Biescas to Zaragoza.

Vote results may shatter Western plans for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Bosnia &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Strenuous and costly Western efforts
to patch up war-torn Bosnia could be wiped out if Serb hard-liners
are declared the big winners of last weekend's elections.
	   Final results won't be known until next week, but initial
indications are that extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen has
defeated the U.S. favorite, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their war-time goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In one of the costliest operations since World War II, the West
has deployed 35,000 peacekeepers and invested billions of dollars a
year to help rebuild Bosnia, but efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and
Muslims together again have shown little result.
	   The West had hoped that the vote would cement Serb moderates in
power and sideline extreme nationalists influenced by war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, a former Bosnian Serb leader, and his
policies of ethnic divisions.
	   During the election campaign, Plavsic and her allies spoke about
the economy and plans to use Western money to raise living
standards. Poplasen and other hard-liners called the moderates
Western stooges who want to unify Serbs with rival Muslims and
Croats in a single state.
	   The United States has made no secret of its favorite. During her
visit to Bosnia last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the U.S. only would assist those who help implement the 1995
Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's 3 1/2-year war.
	   Such open support, however, could have backfired against Plavsic
and her ``Harmony'' coalition because Serbs have a history of
defiance against foreign influence.
	   Nationalist sentiment also may have been rekindled by clashes in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, where the largely Muslim ethnic
Albanian majority is seeking independence from Serb rule.
	   Rising Western pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and so far empty threats of a NATO military intervention
in Kosovo, also hurt the pro-Western Plavsic at the polls, they
said.
	   With a nationalist victory, Milosevic would regain the leverage
over Bosnian Serbs that he lost when the moderates took power. His
hard-line policies would jeopardize any Western plans to stich
Bosnia back together.
	   Western officials fear that returning tens of thousands of
refugees to their prewar homes _ a key provision under the Dayton
plan _ likely would go nowhere under Milosevic's influence.
	   The Clinton administration has not spelled out how it would deal
with a Poplasen government. But U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard has
indicated Washington would try offering economic incentives in

Relations cool over Netanyahu letter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has given a frosty
reception to a letter from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, praising World Jewish Congress head Edgar Bronfman for
his efforts on behalf of Holocaust victims.
	   Israeli officials Friday tried to smooth ruffled Swiss feathers.
But Swiss foreign ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said the
government was reconsidering whether to go ahead with a high-level
Swiss-Israeli economic seminar planned for November.
	   The cause of the problem was an Aug. 28 letter from Netanyahu to
Bronfman thanking him for his efforts ``to redress a terrible
injustice inflicted on the Jewish people.''
	   ``You have provided moral leadership in a long and tough
struggle against those who profited from the unspeakable suffering
of millions of Jews. You have done this with great pride, dignity,
skill and aplomb,'' said Netanyahu.
	   The letter was leaked and printed in a regional Swiss newspaper,
the Thurgauer Zeitung.
	   Following a campaign led by the World Jewish Congress, Swiss
banks agreed in August to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust
survivors to compensate for World War II losses.
	   But the Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for his remarks
earlier this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   During a visit by Swiss president Flavio Cotti to Israel in May,
Netanyahu criticized such bellicose statements. And in a veiled
reference to Bronfman, he said that Israel was ``not at war with
Switzerland.''
	   Thus, diplomatic sources said Cotti and other government leaders
were irritated that the Israeli prime minister should now be
praising Bronfman's methods.
	   Sources in Tel Aviv said Israeli Foreign Ministry director
general Eytan Bentsur phoned Pierre Monod, the Swiss ambassador in
Israel, to explain that the letter was not meant to insult
Switzerland.
	   Bentsur stressed Israel respected the steps taken by Switzerland
to make amends for its role in World War II, the sources said.
	   Neutral Switzerland stayed out of the war and was subsequently
accused by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust and acting
as banker to the Nazis.
	   Cotti himself stayed tight-lipped about the whole affair.
	   He told journalists that Netanyahu's letter to Bronfman was
private.
	   ``We are thinking about this letter and we will specifically try
to draw some conclusions. It remains a private letter,'' he said in
response to a query.

OSCE delegation heading for Albania this weekend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek will lead a high-level delegation to Albania on Saturday to
urge both sides in the current crisis to take measures to restore
stability.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the
delegation will also include Greece's alternate foreign minister,
George Papandreou. Geremek is the current chairman-in-office of the
54-nation OSCE.
	   An OSCE statement said the delegation will meet with President
Rexhap Meidani, Prime Minister Fatos Nano and the ``main political
leaders'' to ``deliver a message to the government and the
opposition with a view to restoring stability, political
cooperation and good governance.''
	   The statement also said it was ``imperative to bring to
justice'' those responsible for last weekend's assassination of
opposition politician Azem Hajdari.
	   Hajdari's death prompted his ally, Sali Berisha, to demand the
government resign and call for new elections.
	   ``The Albanian government and political parties must be aware
that support from the international community for the development
of the country is inevitably linked to their ability to play their
full part in creating a favorable environment for the fruitful use
of resources which have been and will be made available,'' the
statement added.

Mexican president says flood disaster `grave, but under control'

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo called the
flood disaster in southern Mexico ``grave, but under control'' and
insisted that his government was rushing aid to hundreds of
thousands without food or shelter.
	   The official death toll Friday was 162, and officials said they
expect it to rise.
	   Zedillo on Thursday made his fourth visit to Chiapas state since
floods devastated a Massachusetts-sized area last week along the
coast, leaving about 450,000 people homeless.
	   ``Four days ago, the situation was desperate, and today it is
under control,'' Zedillo said. ``But the people are suffering
much.''
	   Shortly before Zedillo arrived in Mapastepec, 55 miles (90
kilometers) northwest of the provincial capital of Tapachula,
people crowded around military helicopters, trying to flee. About
400 men, women and children have left in army and navy helicopters
every day for nearly a week in this farm community of about 10,000.
	   Juan Manuel Villafuerte Figuero, 38, a small-scale farmer,
waited with his wife and three children in the soccer field where
the helicopters were landing.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' he said. ``We'll
look for relatives in other cities, for now. Later, we hope the
government will help us, even with a few sheets of corrugated metal
to build a roof.''
	   Government officials said 250,000 people will probably have to
relocate from their lowland houses and the government may have to
build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed
by the flooding.
	   While Zedillo ordered all government agencies to cooperate in
helping the victims, he chided independent aid groups. ``I have not
seen them here,'' he said.
	   The Red Cross and other groups have said flooded roads, wrecked
bridges, bad weather and a lack of transportation have hindered
their efforts to distribute aid.
	   All 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies, Mexico's lower
house, voted Thursday to donate a day's pay, about dlrs 160, to
help the victims.
	   The Treasury Department also earmarked dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   And the French government announced that they have sent funds
worth dlrs 90,000 to the Mexican Red Cross. They also were sending
a team to help restore clean-water plants, the government said.
	   Officials said they had made headway in restoring electricity
and repairing roads to the region. Some relief trucks have had to
drive through Guatemala, south of the flooded area, because Mexican
roads were damaged.
	   Also Thursday, the federal department of fisheries and the
environment warned against eating seafood in some areas due to
contamination caused by dead animals in the rivers.

First strike of school year; teachers protest hiring freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES new figures. No schools closed due to walkout. Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Teachers across France walked off the job Friday to
protest a hiring freeze by the leftist government and several
thousand marched in Paris during the first strike of the new school
year.
	   Of nearly 667,000 of the teachers in kindergartens, junior high
and high schools nationwide, some 11.3 percent were on strike, the
National Education Ministry said.
	   No schools were closed as a result of the walkout, which came
barely a week after the new school year began.
	   Officials with the United Trade Union Federation (FSU) put the
overall figure at about 35 percent, and 50 percent in high schools.
	   Participation in the Paris region was strong, with the ministry
reporting 18 percent of the teachers there were on strike. However,
only several thousand showed up for the march in the capital.
	   A ministry spokeswoman said they had no figures on school
closures as a result of the walkout, which came barely a week after
the new school year began.
	   Primary schools were not affected because the ministry already
had reached an agreement with unions on personnel issues.
	   Several thousand teachers marched Friday afternoon on the Left
Bank toward the ministry building, with a banner reading ``More
public education ensures the future of our children.''
	   The government had failed to carry out promised reform by
freezing hiring and by limiting education spending, said Laure
Caille, a spokeswoman for the National Union of Secondary
Schoolteachers, (SNES).
	   Teachers plan to strike again next Thursday, Sept. 24.
	   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has
sought to control the government deficit to under 3 percent of the
gross domestic product, as required by the euro currency that takes
effect at the end of the year.

Mexico's Televisa to cut staff by 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa SA plans
to reduce its number of employees by 20 percent by the end of
September, executives told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The cuts aim to achieve a dlrs 60 million reduction in annual
fixed costs by the end of the year, said one executive who spoke on
condition of anonymity. That would be in addition to dlrs 25
million annual savings from layoffs earlier this year, he said.
	   Televisa has made great progress toward its goal of lowering
headcount 20 percent by the end of the month to about 17,000, the
executive said.
	   The cuts reportedly span across all departments and all
seniority levels, including five vice presidents.
	   Two other executives said the latest round of cuts took effect
this month, with many employees leaving the company this week, part
of the overall restructuring at Televisa.
	   Shortly after longtime Chairman Emilio Azcarraga Milmo died last
year, Televisa vowed to cut dlrs 100 million in annual fixed costs.
It sold corporate jets, cut executive pay, and closed offices in
New York and Los Angeles.
	   Layoffs during the first six months of the year reduced annual
costs an additional dlrs 25 million.
	   The cost-cutting drive is being spearheaded by Gilberto
Perezalonso, who was hired by Televisa as chief financial officer
earlier this year from Cifra SA, one of Latin America's
best-performing retailers.

London share prices drop

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices fell on the London Stock Exchange on
Friday, after oil stocks dived following a surprise profit warning
from Royal Dutch-Shell.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 77.3
points, or 1.50 percent, lower at 5,055.6.
	   Volume was 1.11 billion shares compared with 979.3 million on
Thursday.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. warned shareholders that the
results in the current and next quarter are expected to reflect as
difficult a trading environment as there has been in the last five
years.
	   Shell dropped 18.75 pence, or 5.3 percent, to 336 pence with
more than 85 million shares changing hands. The company's profit
warning cited lower refining margins and deteriorating conditions
in the chemicals industry.
	   Shell also said ``tough conditions'' in the oil industry forced
it to close four national head offices and consider writing down
its assets.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Heading into national elections, the
governing Social Democrats admit they can never return the country
to its palmy days of full employment and social services that cost
next to nothing, but the party is poised to retain power.
	   Swedes won't give the party a rousing mandate in the Sunday
voting for the 349 seats in the Riksdag parliament: a poll Friday
published in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed the party
getting support of just 36.8 percent, down from the 45 percent it
got in the 1994 elections.
	   The Left and Green parties stand to win about another 16 percent
of the votes, according to the poll by the SIFO organization of
2,329 people. The Social Democrats would be likely to get their
grudging support, leaving Sweden with an awkward minority
government.
	   The non-socialist parties, led by the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, have hammered the Social Democrats with the
contention that Sweden will be marginalized if it continues to
support the welfare state with taxes that are the world's highest.
	   The conservative parties claim the socialists are holding onto
an outdated concept that ignores the cold realities of a
globalizing economy.
	   But many voters in a country that prides itself on modesty and
egalitarianism are uncomfortable with trusting too much in a free
market where social conscience can take a backseat to
self-interest. ``We think solidarity is modern, and egoism is
old-fashioned,'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson characterized the
ideological divide this week.
	   The 1990s have been a disappointing decade for Sweden's
once-admired ``middle way'' mix of capitalism and socialism. Faced
with crushing debts, the country made sharp cutbacks in its social
service funding. The hospital system that had attracted world
praise was hit by beds shortages and months-long waits for
operations.
	   The Social Democrats, who returned to power in 1994 with the
defeat of Bildt's government, wrestled the economy into a
reasonably healthy position. Unemployment is down from double
digits, although it is still uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent.
Inflation is virtually nil and the country predicts a budget
surplus of about 2 percent this year.
	   ``We need a few more years to restore the welfare system,''
Finance Minister Eric Aasbrink said Friday, but added that ``We
certainly cannot go back to ... 10 years ago, 30 years ago.''
	   That pragmatic outlook apparently has accounted for most of the
Social Democrats' declining support. Pollster Toivo Sjoeren of SIFO
said Friday that almost all the voters who have abandoned the
Social Democrats have headed for the Left Party, which promises not
only a return of the full welfare state but a workweek reduced to
35 hours.
	   The right's message of dissatisfaction and reduced horizons
resonates more with the young, Sjoeren said, noting that although
the Moderates get about 25 percent support overall, 40 percent of
first-time voters support the party.
	   Among them is Karl Olsson, a 22-year-old student coming out of a
Moderates campaign booth on a central Stockholm square
	   Despite recent studies showing Swedish students are among the
best in the world in science and mathematics, he said the
Moderates' call for improving Swedish education appealed to him.
	   ``We need more teachers, smaller classes ... we must build
Sweden further,'' he said.

Russian wins 13th leg; Olano retains lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SABINANIGO, Spain (AP) _ Andrei Zintchenko of Russia gave
Vitalicio Seguros its first victory of this year's Vuelta de Espana
on Friday, taking the 13th leg after riding alone for nearly 90
kilometers (55 miles).
	   Abraham Olano of Banesto remained the overall leader, with
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank in second place
and Fernando Escartin, of Spain and Kelme Costa-Blanca, in third.
	   The front-runners appear to be saving their strength for the
last week of the 22-stage tour, which includes several legs in the
mountains outside Madrid, and a key time-trial in the town of
Fuenlabrada.
	   Zintchenko took 5 hours, 7 minutes and 12 seconds to cover a
208- kilometer (130-mile) trek that began and ended in this
northern town.
	   Belgian Ludo Dierckxens of Lotto-Mobistar followed in second
with Unai Etxebarria of Euskatel-Euskadi in third, both 2 minutes
and 20 seconds behind Zintchenko.
	   The gaffe of the day went to Alexandre Moos of Switzerland and
Saeco, who pulled away from the pack with 3 kilometers (2 miles) to
go and raised his arms as he crossed the finish line, thinking he'd
won. He actually finished sixth, 3 minutes and 29 seconds behind
Zintchenko.
	   Saturday's 14th leg covers 145.5 kilometers (91 miles) from
Biescas to Zaragoza.

Spanish Prime Minister Aznar tours Peru's Inca capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar toured
the historic Inca capital of Cuzco on Friday, cutting short his
visit to Peru after Spain's Basque separatists declared a
cease-fire.
	   Aznar was scheduled to visit Cuzco, 350 miles (565 kilometers)
southeast of Lima high in the Andes mountains, on Saturday, which
was to be the last day of his four-day visit to Peru.
	   The Spanish leader will likely return to Madrid late Friday or
earlier Saturday, cutting short the visit by one day, a Peruvian
foreign ministry spokesman said.
	   With Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori at the wheel of their
car, Aznar and his wife Ana Botella toured Cuzco, the center of the
Incan empire and hub of Peru's tourism industry.
	   In a news conference Thursday at the presidential palace in
Lima, Aznar gave his first comments on the ETA's cease-fire, saying
the separatist group should demonstrate its desire for peace with
``acts, not declarations.''
	   Aznar will return Friday afternoon to Lima to visit a
thermoelectric plant and an oil refinery owned by Spanish
investors.
	   Fujimori and Aznar signed three agreements to strengthen
relations between the two countries, including an offer of
low-interest loans to Peru to help it recover from the El Nino
weather phenomenon and a commitment to cooperate in the fight
against drug-crop cultivation.
	   Spain is the largest foreign investor in Peru. Spain's
Telefonica de Espana bought Peru's state telephone company in 1994
for dlrs 2 billion, accounting for much of this investment.

Iranian newspaper editor heads home to certain jail

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The managing director of Iran's
only independent daily newspaper is flying home Saturday to be
arrested.
	   Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara is not sure what the charge is. He
doesn't know what punishment he faces, where he will be jailed, or
when he'll be able to speak publicly again.
	   Tous, the second-most popular newspaper in Iran, was shut down
and banned on Wednesday, several senior editors and publishing
directors either arrested or sought on warrants. Sazgara's name was
on a warrant, too.
	   Under the circumstances, why would anyone take their family and
go home?
	   ``I'm a citizen of Iran, first of all. Second, my friends are in
jail,'' Sazgara, 43, said Friday in an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   ``Although I don't agree with this ban on our newspaper _ this
ban is against the press law _ I think that I have to go back
because I respect the law,'' he said, sipping water and rubbing
sleepy eyes.
	   Sazgara had just begun what was supposed to be a one-week
vacation. He was on a stopover in Malaysia, waiting for a flight to
join his wife and two teen-age sons in New Zealand.
	   On Wednesday, Sazgara's brother, the Iranian ambassador to New
Zealand, called to tell him that the two-month-old Tous had been
banned and Sazgara was wanted for arrest.
	   The journalist plans to head home, with his wife and sons, on an
Iranian Airlines flight that will land Sunday in Tehran.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tous was ordered
shut for publishing articles detrimental ``to the country's
national interests and security.''
	   The order came a day after Iran's supreme religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the judiciary to deal with
newspapers abusing the country's press freedoms.
	   ``We tried to be independent. We tried to provide different
views, multiple sources for the news. That was the main problem ...
in Iran. But that is the duty of any journalist,'' Sazgara said.
	   There has been an atmosphere of more freedom and openness since
the election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami last year.
	   Sazgara has no idea whether that sentiment will help him, or
whether the closing of Tous is part of a new period of restrictions
on speech and press as tensions build between Iran and its
neighbor, Afghanistan.
	   Tous had been calling for diplomacy instead of military strikes
and has angered some hard-liners with its anti-war stance.
	   Recalling reader support for his newspaper, he added, ``They
were waiting for us on the streets for our new newspaper. I can
imagine that they are waiting for us now.''

Pope begins 3-day pastoral trip in Italy

	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ Crowds of people singing, waving, cheering
and even weeping greeted Pope John Paul II on Friday as he opened a
three-day pastoral trip in the little diocese of an old hiking
companion.
	   Greeting well-wishers outside a church in Chiavari dedicated to
the Virgin Mary, he spoke of local problems _ an aging population,
shrinking job opportunities, the rising cost of living.
	   At the heart of the church is an icon of the Virgin Mary painted
in 1493. The icon is credited with saving Chiavari from a cholera
epidemic in 1835.
	   The pope urged people to turn to Mary for comfort and to muster
the energy with which to ``renovate a society solid with justice
and love.''
	   This quiet little resort town on the Italian Riviera was abuzz
for hours even before the pope arrived.
	   Crowds of people thronged its streets and shopkeepers festooned
their windows with yellow-and-white papal flags. Special trains and
buses were laid on to bring in pilgrims, and local artisans labored
over an altar in the shape of a boat.
	   A town of only 28,000 south of the port city of Genoa, Chiavari
is unused to such excitement. But its bishop, Alberto Careggio, is
an old friend of the pontiff and for years helped organize John
Paul's summer vacations in the Italian Alps.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff is well-known as a world traveler, but
he also makes pastoral visits inside Italy and to parish churches
in Rome, where he is the bishop.
	   ``It gives me great joy every time I visit a local church,'' he
said Friday.
	   The pope met later with local clergy, nuns, monks and
seminarians.
	   ``Dear ones,'' he said, ``your constant duty is to imitate the
Good Shepherd. Know how to listen to those who are entrusted to
your care.''
	   His schedule also included a seaside Mass in Chiavari on
Saturday before he flies to his second stop, Brescia near Lake
Garda. He returns to Rome on Sunday.

Mantilla on track for double at Bornemouth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Defending champion Felix Mantilla of
Spain beat Stefan Koubek of Austria 6-7 (8-6), 6-4, 6-4 Friday to
advance to the semifinals of the clay-court Samsung Open at West
Hants Club.
	   The No. 3 seed will meet Marc-Kevin Goellnar in the semifinals
after the unseeded German scored a straight-sets 6-4, 6-3
quarterfinal win over No. 1 seed Alberto Berasategui of Spain.
	   The 27-year-old German said he had never won a set against
Berasategui but had finally worked out how to play his forehand,
which was the major factor in his win Friday.
	   Goellnar, a runner-up to Albert Costa of Spain at West Hants two
years ago, took an hour to beat Berasategui and set up a possible
replay of the 1996 final.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 2 seed Costa dropped the first set
and struggled early against No. 8 seed Arnard Clement of France
before clinching a semifinal berth. The match was decided on a
tiebreak in the third, with Costa winning 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Italy's Vincenzo Santopadre booked a semifinal meeting with
Costa with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Alex Lopez-Moron of Spain.
	   In the only doubles semifinal, Wayne Arthurs of Australia and
Berasategui ousted No. 1 seeds David Adams of South Africa and
Daivd Macpherson of Australia 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.
	   The second doubles semifinal, which pits Michael Kohlmann and
Lars Wahlgren of Germany, against Neil Broad of Britain and Kevin
Ullyett of South Africa, will be played Saturday.

After international turmoil, central bank rises key rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ After four consecutive days of
intervention to support the krone, the central bank on Friday said
it will raise its floor discount and deposit rates by 0.5
percentage points each to 4.25 percent.
	   The reason for the rate hike was the current unrest in the
international markets, the Central Bank said in a statement, adding
it had forced them to sell ``foreign exchange to a significant
degree to stabilize the krone.''
	   A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the extent of krone
purchasing and the amount of foreign exchange selling.
	   The Nationalbanken also said it will lift its key securities
repurchase rate by one percentage point to 5 percent as of Monday.

Official: Russia's main security service badly under-funded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's main security agency, the Federal
Security Service, has only half the funds it needs and has no money
for modernizing weapons or maintaining all of its anti-terrorist
units, a spokesman said Friday.
	   Spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said the service would have to cut
its anti-terrorist troops, but ``we will do our best to preserve
the core of the combat units.'' He denied suggestions that the
Federal Security Service would disband its elite Alpha commando
units or force officers to retire, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Most of Russia's government agencies have been badly underfunded
for years, and the current economic crisis is likely to make their
situation worse.
	   Zdanovich also said that Federal Security Service personnel are
paid less than their colleagues in the Interior Ministry or
Prosecutor General's office.
	   The Federal Security Service is the main successor agency to the
KGB, which was dissolved after the 1991 Soviet collapse because
many people at home and abroad saw it as a symbol of Communist
repression.

Forget inflation: Brazilians now worry about deflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ For years, Brazilians suffered
under high inflation. Today, they're worried about deflation.
	   Consumer prices in major cities fell 0.5 percent in August,
following a 0.3 percent drop in July, the government-run Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics said.
	   It was the first time prices had declined in consecutive months
since the institute began measuring inflation in 1979.
	   While lower prices may be a boon for consumers, they also
reflect an economic slowdown that could lead to recession, the
institute said.
	   Eulina dos Santos, an analyst for the institute, said the
deflation was a result of high interest rates that forced retailers
to lower prices to attract customers.
	   Clothing prices fell 4 percent in August, a seasonal decline
caused by sales at the end of the Southern Hemisphere winter. But
prices for food, housing and other items also went down.
	   The problem is that continuous declining prices can reflect a
strong retraction of the economy, with higher unemployment and
little or no growth.
	   ``We can start thinking about getting worried,'' dos Santos told
the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo.
	   Last week, Brazil's Central Bank raised its key lending rate to
nearly 50 percent a year in an effort to lure back investors who
were taking money out of the country.
	   The country has lost about dlrs 25 billion in reserves since
August, as investors worry about the health of the Brazilian
economy amid the turmoil that has hit Asian markets.
	   Most analysts think Brazil's economy will grow 1 percent or less
this year, and the outlook for 1999 is no better.
	   Runaway inflation was a problem until 1994, when a new economic
program called the Real Plan ended the constant price rises.
Inflation that was running at 50 percent a month in mid-1994 now
should be less than 4 percent for the entire year, the institute
said.

El Nino and La Nina blamed for food crises worldwide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Forty countries worldwide are experiencing food
emergencies, blamed largely on El Nino and La Nina, the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization said Friday.
	   The shift in world weather patterns has mainly affected Africa,
Latin America and Asia.
	   Africa is the continent with the most acute food shortages, with
civil strife aggravating shortages caused by bad weather, the
Rome-based agency said. In Sudan, 2.6 million people are in need of
food assistance despite an overall satisfactory harvest in 1997,
the FAO said. Both civil strife and drought brought about the
current shortages.
	   In Ethiopia, more than 5 million people are at risk due to a
poor 1997 harvest, the agency said.

Iraqis invest heavily in shares as hedge against inflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Baghdad Stock Exchange is breaking
records for turnover as Iraqis rush to buy shares as a hedge
against inflation, brokers said Friday.
	   The value of shares traded on the exchange has exceeded 500
million Iraqi dinars (dlrs 265,596) every week since Aug. 5 when
the government froze cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors,
starting the current row with the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Security Council has condemned the Iraqi move and suspended
its reviews of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed against Baghdad
since its forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Previously, the value of shares traded used to average about
350,000 dinars (dlrs 185,381).
	   Brokers said Iraqis were buying shares as a hedge against
inflation, believing that stocks were a better investment than
money in the bank.
	   The dinar's value has fallen about 15 percent against the dollar
since early August. It is now trading at about 1,888 to the dollar.
	   The exchange was set up in 1992 with business limited to one day
a week. It has been open three days a week since early this year.
	   Foreigners are not allowed to buy shares in Iraq.

Princess Anne attends funeral of former father-in-law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Anne attended the funeral Friday of her
former father-in-law, Maj. Peter Phillips who once famously
described her as ``a great girl.''
	   The princess joined her ex-husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, and
their two children, Peter, 21, and Zara, 17, at the packed village
church of St. Peter and St. Paul at Great Somerford in western
England.
	   After the service, Princess Anne chatted with her ex-husband and
other mourners in the churchyard, then drove herself away in a dark
blue Bentley. Her second husband, Capt. Tim Laurence, did not
attend.
	   Maj. Phillips, 78, died Saturday at the Ilson House Nursing Home
near Tetbury in southwest England after several years of ill
health. His wife, Anne, died in 1988 at the age of 62.
	   Phillips was thrust into the limelight in 1973 when his son
began a romance with Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter. The couple
married that year, but divorced in 1992.

Strike shuts down Bolivian airline LAB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Employees of the Bolivian airline Lloyd
Aereo Boliviano shut down domestic and international flights Friday
to demand payment of a dlrs 11 million court judgment for social
benefits.
	   The strike seriously disrupted air traffic in Bolivia since the
only other airline operating in Bolivia, AeroSur, only has three
planes in service. Thousands of passengers were left stranded
throughout Bolivia because of the 24-hour strike.
	   Workers are demanding payment of 56.6 million bolivianos (dlrs
11 million) that the Supreme Court ruled was due to them for years
of service. Two judges of the Supreme Court are being tried by
Congress for alleged acts of corruption related to the ruling.
	   LAB, which is owned by the Brazilian airline VASP, says it will
not pay the judgment because according to a presidential decree,
any judgments that occurred after they purchased the airline three
years ago would be covered by the government.
	   The government, meanwhile, refuses to pay and says LAB is
responsible for paying workers.
	   LAB flies throughout Bolivia and to Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico,
Chile, United States, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.
	   Minister of Labor Leopoldo Lopez declared the strike illegal.

Caribbean countries sink more money into beleaguered banana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ With four years remaining before its
trade protections fall to the new world order, several eastern
Caribbean nations are pumping dlrs 55.5 million into their banana
industry to save it from destruction.
	   Banana production on the small islands has risen and fallen
dramatically over the years, buffeted by everything from currency
fluctuations to labor unrest to hurricanes. Now, free-trade
agreements are the main threat to the crop that has been a mainstay
of some eastern Caribbean economies.
	   Last year, the United States challenged the preferences some
European countries give to bananas from their former colonies. And
in 2002, with the phase-in of the European Union, the Caribbean
countries will have to compete in a free market.
	   The Caribbean producers generally have higher costs and can
produce less fruit than U.S.-owned companies operating in Central
and South America.
	   Rather than give up on bananas, the islands are investing in the
future of the industry. St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony said
Tuesday that St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and Grenada would together invest dlrs 55.5 million to expand and
strengthen banana production.
	   The banana trade brought prosperity to the islands in the 1960s
and 1970s, but has declined since, according to a report on the
industry by Cargill Technical Services Ltd. of England.
	   In St. Lucia, production dropped from 133,000 tons in 1990 to
71,395 tons last year. In Grenada, the industry nearly disappeared,
dropping from 7,430 tons to 102 tons in the same time period.
	   Currently, the Windward Islands are supplying Europe with only
58 percent of their quota.
	   St. Lucia, where the crop once accounted for 60 percent of trade
earnings, still suffers from labor unrest in 1993, when strikes and
protests led to the shooting deaths of two farmers by police and
the destruction of plantations.
	   Despite the problems in the industry and the attacks on trade
preferences, the islands are committed to sticking with banana
production as a key component of their economies.
	   Visiting the islands last week, U.S. State Department official
John Hamilton announced a three-year, dlrs 4.7 million project to
help the islands diversify their economies. The program is meant to
fulfill a promise made more than a year earlier by President Bill
Clinton, to help offset the effect of U.S. challenges of the
European trade preferences.
	   But industry officials in the islands say diversification means
helping unsuccessful farmers move to other crops, not the
elimination of bananas as a key export.
	   Bananas provide a quicker return on investment than other tree
crops and are often the only option for farmers to raise the cash
they need to obtain credit and keep their farms operating.

Country wishes prime minister well, but wonders about his fitness

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norwegians remain sympathetic for their
popular prime minister, now in his third week of sick leave for
mental depression, but some worry the job may simply be too tough
for him.
	   The time off may have restored Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik's spirits, but when he comes back to work _ scheduled for
Sept. 24 _ he will face the same problems that pushed him to the
depths.
	   ``One thing is depression because of, for example, the loss of a
child,'' said Jorend Sjoeberg, a nurse. But with Bondevik, the
depression is from his daily job, and the pressures that led to his
illness might lead to a relapse, she said.
	   Bondevik's sick leave began Aug. 31 and twice was extended
beyond the expected return date.
	   His spokesman Oeystein Oestang acknowledged Friday that ``to be
prime minister, he must be prime minister 100 percent'' _ and he
said Bondevik will be when he returns to office next Thursday.
	   An ordained Lutheran minister, Bondevik promised voters he would
increase cash payments to mothers who stayed home to take care of
their young children. He's been unable to fulfill that pledge and,
friends said, he took that to heart as a personal failure.
	   During his absence, a member of his fragile ruling coalition,
Anne Enger Lahnstein, has taken his place, though only Bondevik can
hold things together. In elections last September, the three
parties in his coalition won barely 25 percent of seats in
parliament.
	   In addition to political opposition, Bondevik faced economic
pressures as the world price for oil, Norway's main industry, fell
this year. Bank interest rates nearly doubled to 10 percent in
recent weeks, hurting homeowners with variable mortgages.
	   The krone slipped in value, though now it's back to about 7.5
per U.S. dollar.
	   For the past three weeks, Bondevik, 51, has travelled between
his apartment south of Oslo and a quiet cabin in a mountain valley
located several hours' drive north of the capital. He has not been
hospitalized, Oestang said.
	   Bondevik occasionally has been in touch with his office but has
had little participation in preparing next year's proposed national
budget, Oestang said.
	   A week after Bondevik's disappearance, a poll showed that 82
percent of Norwegians thought it was proper for him to be so open
in citing a sickness that prominent figures elsewhere in most any
field might have hidden, for fear others would use it to disqualify
them.
	   That sentiment has not flagged.
	   A newspaper that tracked him down last week and published the
approximate location of his cabin _ despite Bondevik's request for
privacy and refusal to comment _ was criticized for being in bad
taste.
	   So were politicians who expressed anything other than full
support, including Carl I. Hagen, leader of the far-right Progress
Party, who requested that government provide parliament a medical
report on Bondevik's health.
	   ``Bondevik shows honesty and humanness that I respect,'' Odd
Nygaard, a schoolteacher, said Friday. ``It must be allowed for a
politician also to show that people can get sick and react to
stress.''
	   However, he, too, worried about the effect on Bondevik's ability
to govern effectively. ``A politically hamstrung government would
damage our reputation.''
	   Several political commentators have speculated that Bondevik's
weak coalition will break apart before the end of the year.
Bondevik's Christian People's Party and his coalition partners have
sunk to around 20 percent approval ratings.
	   Presuming he returns next week, he'd have about a week to
prepare for the next session of parliament. One of his first tasks
would be to defend his coalition's budget proposal.

Treasures of Picasso muse Dora Maar go to auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A half-century after Picasso dumped her for a new
love, Dora Maar died alone and forgotten, comforted by mementos and
artworks from the artistic titan who betrayed her.
	   Now Dora's shrine to lost love is headed for the auction block,
an unexpected treasure trove that blends the legend and legacy of
one of the art world's greatest womanizers.
	   The extraordinary cache constitutes one of the last important
Picasso collections still in private hands outside his family. Only
a handful of the items have been seen in public.
	   It includes 10 major oils, seven of them portraits of Dora, as
well as hundreds of drawings, photographs and sculpture, almost all
of it bearing her likeness.
	   The oils are estimated conservatively to be worth dlrs 26
million. Auctioneers say they will probably bring much more, due to
competition among buyers from around the world.
	   France has a law that keeps national treasures in the country
but in this case is expected to allow the vast majority of the
works to leave.
	   ``It's a slice of life,'' said Lucien Solanet, one of the
auctioneers handling the three-day sale starting Oct. 27 at the
Maison de la Chimie in Paris.
	   From the emotional violence that emerges from ``Dora Weeping''
to the tenderness of tiny portraits carved on pebbles and rings,
``The Picassos of Dora Maar'' bear witness to the artist's
all-encompassing vitality during their eight-year affair.
	   The daughter of a Yugoslav architect and a French mother, Dora
Maar died a recluse in July 1997 at the age of 89. She left no will
or apparent heirs, only an apartment filled with relics of a
passion that Picasso often expressed in whimsical ways.
	   The collection includes tiny abstract animals sculpted from
bottle caps, mini-portraits on match boxes dashed off in
restaurants, a painted sculpture on raw, rotting wood and portraits
crafted from red and white paper tablecloths with cigarette burns
for eyes.
	   ``Picasso worked compulsively when he was in love, and Dora kept
everything,'' Solanet said. ``It was like her private museum.''
	   Dora was 29, and an accomplished photographer with close ties to
Surrealism when she met Picasso in Paris in 1936.
	   At the time, he was struggling to divorce his first wife, Olga,
and was already involved with Marie-Therese Walter, a voluptuous
blond who would give birth a year later to his daughter Maya.
	   But Dora's striking dark beauty, strong artistic temperament and
fluent Spanish learned during her childhood in Argentina were
irresistible.
	   Her classic features would become an obsession, and Picasso
sketched her constantly, on dozens of different supports and in
myriad poses _ weeping, sleeping, pensive, making love, head thrown
back, at the beach.
	   Dora also shared Picasso's politics.
	   She alone was allowed to photograph successive stages of
``Guernica,'' the masterpiece screaming his outrage over the German
bombing of the ancient village of Guernica in northern Spain. She
was the model for the work's weeping woman.
	   Picasso cheated relentlessly on Dora and Marie-Therese, painting
them in the same pose on the same day, with his conflicting
emotions ending up on the canvas.
	   In ``Portrait of Dora Wearing a Garland of Flowers,'' dated just
a month after they met, Picasso depicts Dora with the same floral
headpiece that Marie-Therese usually wore in paintings.
	   Five years later, he united them in ``Reclining Nude and Seated
Woman,'' where Dora's angular face and shriveled breasts contrast
with Marie-Therese's rounded curves.
	   Picasso, whose sadism toward his mistresses has been
well-documented, was known to mock Dora's infertility. The paper
cuts-outs he crafted for Maya, his daughter by Marie-Therese, are
part of the collection.
	   Dora became increasingly distraught as the relationship soured.
She had her first serious nervous breakdown in 1944 after Picasso
ditched her for the younger Francoise Gilot.
	   Proceeds of the sale will be divided among two distant heirs,
the genealogists who tracked them down and the French state.

Shell sees gloomiest oil market in five years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Graf 7 CORRECTS Paris office, not Frankfurt, closed &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a
gloomy assessment of the oil business on Friday _ sending its
shares tumbling despite its plans to weather the weak market by
closing four big European offices.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart warned shareholders
that ``the results in the current and next quarter are expected to
reflect as difficult a trading environment as we have seen in the
last five years.''
	   Investors pushed Shell shares down by 5.6 percent in heavy
volume on the London Stock Exchange, while Royal Dutch stock fell
6.1 percent in Amsterdam.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell predicted depressed oil prices won't recover
any time soon, with the market glutted even as the ripple effects
of the Asian economic crisis are spreading into other regions.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil group said it is responding by cutting out
some bureaucratic fat.
	   It will close big offices that run its operations in Britain,
the Netherlands, France and Germany, leaving employees in smaller,
decentralized offices to deal directly with headquarters.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell will close its national head offices in
London, where 2,000 people work; Rotterdam, where 470 people work;
Hamburg, where 850 people work; and Paris, where 900 people work.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell could not say how many of the jobs will be
eliminated, although many of the people will be transferred to
other offices.
	   For example, Shell U.K. announced it will send 300 of the 2,000
people in the London office to Aberdeen, Scotland, where it runs
its North Sea oil operations.
	   ``There will be some job losses, but the number is unclear,''
said Shell spokesman Eric Nickson in London.
	   The big oil group is facing tough times in a market that has
seen crude oil prices plunge this year to levels unseen in a
decade.
	   The collapse started in the winter, when OPEC started pumping
more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis began
choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell chairman, Moody-Stuart, was to offer his
bleak assessment in a speech to be delivered later in the day to
fund managers in San Francisco. The company released highlights
ahead of time.
	   Moody-Stuart said that while the average price of Brent crude
oil over the past decade has been dlrs 18 per barrel, Royal
Dutch-Shell expects that over the next two to three years ``it
could stay depressed at levels between dlrs 12 and dlrs 16 per
barrel.''
	   Royal Dutch-Shell would probably have to write down the value of
some of its assets, even as it works to make its business more
efficient to weather the weak market conditions, the chairman said.

Ukrainian president in Moscow for talks with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Yeltsin, Kuchma quotes in grafs 3-5,
Primakov meeting Pustovoitenko in graf 8. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had hoped for a
major summit with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in Ukraine, with
large delegations covering a wide range of issues.
	   Instead, Kuchma arrived in Moscow on Friday for a low-key
session with Yeltsin, to be held behind closed doors at a Russian
presidential residence outside Moscow. Upon arriving at a Moscow
airport, Kuchma boarded a helicopter to meet with Yeltsin.
	   ``Our strategic partnership remains the main thing and we feel
close to one another, both as friends and as partners,'' Yeltsin
said. Both he and Kuchma were dressed casually in cardigans and
open-necked shirts, underlining that this was a friendly, informal
visit.
	   ``Alone, it's harder for us,'' Kuchma said.
	   The economic crisis in Russia is keeping Yeltsin occupied and
``does not provide for travels,'' Kuchma had said Thursday. The
summit had originally been planned for the Ukrainian industrial
town of Kharkiv.
	   Instead of a range of mutual cooperation issues, the meeting is
to focus on Russia's economic crisis, its effects on neighboring
Ukraine and the formation of a new government in Moscow, Kuchma
said.
	   ``What road Russia takes in the future, what economic policies
the new government adopts in its program _ all that will
significantly influence the situation in Ukraine,'' he said.
	   While Kuchma and Yeltsin conferred, Russia's new prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, met with his Ukrainian counterpart Valery
Pustovoitenko. The two premiers made no statements to the media.
	   The Russian crisis has put heavy pressure on Ukraine, a fellow
Slav nation of 50 million people. The hryvna currency went down
from 2.1 in mid-August to 2.94 Thursday as the government was
forced to expand its currency fluctuation band, and investors have
been leaving the shaky Ukrainian market.
	   Russia's financial downfall also is affecting Ukrainian exports.
Ukraine annually exports to Russia more than dlrs 10 billion worth
of commodities, or a third of its total exports, and these exports
were decreasing even before the crisis.
	   Kuchma, speaking in Kiev, said he would bring to Moscow a
far-reaching proposal for the creation of a free trade zone between
the two countries and other former Soviet republics instead of the
inefficient customs union set up by several ex-Soviet nations.
That, he said, would be ``the best way out'' of the crisis.
	   But Ukrainian media remained skeptical, pointing out that Russia
was not likely to open its market to the relatively cheap Ukrainian
goods.
	   Ukrainian officials say the sides still might discuss their
ambitious plan for economic cooperation signed in February. The
Russian side is likely to raise several painful questions, such as
that of Ukraine's debt for Russian natural gas and the issue of
Russian naval bases in Ukraine.

Iraqis invest heavily in stock exchange as hedge against inflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Baghdad Stock Exchange is breaking
records for turnover as Iraqis rush to buy shares as a hedge
against inflation, brokers said Friday.
	   The value of shares traded on the exchange has exceeded 500
million Iraqi dinars (dlrs 265,500) every week since Aug. 5 when
the government froze cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors,
starting the current row with the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Security Council has condemned the Iraqi move and suspended
its reviews of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed against Baghdad
since the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   Previously, the value of shares traded averaged about 350,000
dinars (dlrs 185,380).
	   Brokers said Iraqis were buying shares as a hedge against
inflation, believing that stocks were a better investment than
money in the bank.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Teachers across France walked off the job Friday to
protest a hiring freeze by the leftist government and several
thousand marched in Paris during the first strike of the new school
year.
	   Of nearly 667,000 of the teachers in kindergartens, junior high
and high schools nationwide, some 11.3 percent were on strike, the
National Education Ministry said.
	   No schools were closed as a result of the walkout, which came
barely a week after the new school year began.
	   Officials with the United Trade Union Federation (FSU) put the
overall figure at about 35 percent, and 50 percent in high schools.
	   Participation in the Paris region was strong, with the ministry
reporting 18 percent of the teachers there were on strike. However,
only several thousand showed up for the march in the capital.
	   The walkout came barely a week after the new school year began.

	   Fifth-Century Shopping Center Found
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a
5th-century Byzantine shopping mall at a site in northern Israel
where a new mall is to be built.
	   The Byzantine remains were discovered during a ``rescue dig''
preceding construction of the new mall in the northern town of Bet
Shean, renowned for its Roman ruins.
	   About 109 yards (meters) of road were uncovered, including
basalt paving stones, mosaic sidewalks, and the remains of
colonnades and six shop fronts, Danny Syon, an archaeologist with
Israel's Antiquities Authority and director of the dig, said
Monday.
	   At the entrance to one shop, the sidewalk is decorated with a
colored mosaic showing a red foliage pattern and the phrase ``For
the Victory of the Blues'' inscribed in Greek, Syon said.
	   The inscription is a reference to two competing factions, the
Blues and the Greens, which sprang from competing allegiances at
horse races during the Byzantine period, Syon said.
	   ``Apparently the shop owner was a fan of the Blues,'' he said.
	   Most of the street will be covered up when the new mall is built
later this year, but the inscription and some of the mosaic
sidewalk will be preserved _ either beneath the modern shops or in
spaces between them, Syon said.
	   The roads and shops were the first significant evidence of the
southern section of the large Byzantine city of Bet Shean, Syon
said.
	   Nothing was found inside the shops to give any indication of
what kind of merchandise was sold there, he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use information from the story to answer the following
questions:
	   1. Where did archeologists find the remains of a 5th-century

Caribbean countries sink more money into beleaguered banana

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ With four years remaining before its
trade protections fall to the new world order, several eastern
Caribbean nations are pumping dlrs 55.5 million into their banana
industry to save it from destruction.
	   Banana production on the small islands has risen and fallen
dramatically over the years, buffeted by everything from currency
fluctuations to hurricanes. Now, free-trade agreements are the main
threat to the crop that has been a mainstay of some eastern
Caribbean economies.
	   Last year, the United States challenged the preferences some
European countries give to bananas from their former colonies. And
in 2002, with the phase-in of the European Union, the Caribbean
countries will have to compete in a free market.
	   Caribbean producers generally have higher costs and can produce
less fruit than U.S.-owned companies operating in Central and South
America.
	   Rather than give up on bananas, the islands are investing in the
industry. St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony said Tuesday that
St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada
would together spend dlrs 55.5 million to expand and strengthen
banana production.
	   The banana trade brought prosperity to the islands in the 1960s
and 1970s but has declined since, according to a report on the
industry by Cargill Technical Services Ltd. of England.
	   In St. Lucia, production dropped from 133,000 tons in 1990 to
71,395 tons last year. In Grenada, the industry nearly disappeared,
dropping from 7,430 tons to 102 tons in the same time period.

Mexico's Televisa to cut about 4,000 jobs to slash costs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs at end with TV Azteca belt-tightening measures.
EDITS thruout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Grupo Televisa SA, Mexico's largest
television network, plans to slash about 4,000 jobs, or 20 percent
of its work force, by the end of September as part of a yearlong
cost-cutting effort.
	   The cuts, which will leave Televisa with about 17,000 employees,
aim to achieve dlrs 60 million in annual cost reductions,
executives said Friday. That would add to dlrs 25 million in annual
savings from layoffs during the first six months of the year.
	   The latest cuts span across all departments and all seniority
levels. Many of the affected employees were leaving the company
this week.
	   Shortly after longtime Chairman Emilio Azcarraga Milmo died last
year, Televisa vowed to cut dlrs 100 million in annual fixed costs.
It sold corporate jets, cut executive pay, and closed offices in
New York and Los Angeles.
	   The cost-cutting drive is being spearheaded by Gilberto
Perezalonso, who was lured to Televisa as chief financial officer
earlier this year from Cifra SA, one of Latin America's
best-performing retailers.
	   The cuts at Televisa coincide with belt-tightening at archrival
TV Azteca SA. TV Azteca announced Tuesday it would cut sales and
administrative expenses 20 percent and top executive pay 10 percent
to prepare for a slowdown in the Mexican economy.
	   TV Azteca also said it was trimming 1998 investment spending to
dlrs 25 million from dlrs 35 million and declared its international
expansion in ``slight recess.''

	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ Soldiers and police stood guard Friday
outside the northern Mexico hospital room where Fermin Castro lay
in a coma with bullet wounds suffered in the execution-style
slaying of 18 members of his extended family.
	   Castro apparently was the target of Thursday's attack, but in
the parking lot of Ensenada's Del Castro hospital, family members
leaned on pickup trucks and said Castro had no enemies they knew
of.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   Mexican and foreign media speculated about a possible motive in
the slayings, all suggesting it was a battle of unprecedented
brutality in the nation's drug wars.
	   Police said they had no suspects in the attack, but family
members said several ranch hands who lived in the family compound
had been detained.
	   It was unclear whether the workers were present at the time of
the massacre or whether they had been given the day off for
Mexico's Independence Day.
	   A local radio station cited traditional punishments among drug
traffickers in which smugglers who changed sides from one
organization to another would have their entire family killed.
	   Local media also cited a supposed quarrel between Fermin Castro
and unidentified men that occurred at Independence Day celebrations
on the eve of the massacre.
	   Police said Castro had been under investigation in the past for
reasons they would not disclose.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   The government news agency Notimex quoted the Baja California
state attorney general as saying that Castro was suspected of
growing marijuana for the Arellano Felix gang, Mexico's most
powerful drug-smuggling organization, based 60 miles (95
kilometers) north in Tijuana.
	   The attorney general, Marco Antonio de la Fuente Villarreal,
later backed away from those reported comments, saying: ``We cannot
say 100 percent that (the attack) was an aspect of drug
trafficking.''
	   The New York Times on Friday quoted federal Attorney General
Jorge Madrazo as saying that Castro ``was suspected of being an
associate of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the Arellano
Felix organization.''
	   Higueras has been using Ensenada as a trafficking base, it
quoted Madrazo as saying in an interview. Madrazo's office did not
respond to requests for confirmation.
	   But Castro's relatives said they didn't know of any drug ties.
	   They described him as a man who liked betting and made frequent
trips to the southwestern United States to see farm animals and
ranches.
	   Early Thursday, gunmen pulled up at Castro's compound in the
Ensenada suburb of El Sauzal, lined up members of his extended
family and told them to lie face down, then shot them all.
	   Eight children and 10 adults died, including Macaria Jaime
Tovar, who family members said was eight months pregnant.
	   The only survivors were Castro, 12-year-old Mario Alberto Flores
_ who suffered unspecified but serious injuries _ and Viviana
Flores, 15, who apparently escaped unharmed.
	   Police said a 15-year-old girl survived the attack by hiding
under a bed.

U.S. envoy links aid to implementation of Dayton accord

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A U.S. official linked
continued American aid to respect for democracy and a commitment to
peace in Bosnia, where the moderate incumbent was believed to be
trailing Friday in the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy for the Balkans, arrived here
following reports that ultra-nationalist Nikola Poplasen was
leading the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in incomplete returns
from the Sept. 12-13 election.
	   A Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It would also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   Bosnians chose candidates for the three-member joint national
presidency, a national parliament and regional and local posts.
Those in the Serb-run area also voted for their president.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
supervised the election, has refused to release any returns, citing
a complicated ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the
need for accuracy. Western officials have admitted Plavsic is
trailing in the Bosnian Serb presidential race, although they have
not said how many ballots remain to be counted.
	   Gelbard stressed U.S. aid depended on the respect of democracy
and commitment to the 1995 peace deal that envisages a unified
Bosnia, not the person in power.
	   ``What we are interested in is, whoever is in power, that they
implement the Dayton agreement,'' he said after meeting Plavsic.
``If they do, we will support them. If they do not, they will get
no support from the U.S., including economic support.''
	   ``If some had become converted in supporting the implementation
of then Dayton agreement then we are happy,'' he added.
	   That sentiment was echoed in Washington, where State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the message which the Clinton
Administration wanted to send was ``If you are prepared to
implement the provision of Dayton's requirements, then we are
prepared to work with you.''
	   ``If you are not, we will respond accordingly,'' Rubin told
reporters Friday. ``And our financial assistance, our diplomatic
work and all of our work will be premised on that simple principle.
	   ''Those who will support the Dayton accords will receive support
from the United States, and by extension, the West.''
	   He added that, so far as the United States could determine, the
election was the freest and fairest in Bosnia's short democratic
history.
	   Plavsic was once an ardent Serb nationalist allied with
Karadzic. Throughout the Bosnian war, she backed Serb purges of
other ethnic groups and was often seen visiting troops at the front
lines.
	   She took over the Bosnian Serb presidency in 1996, but a year
later broke with the hard-liners after accusing them of widespread
corruption. The West took her side, seeing an opportunity to weaken
Karadzic.
	   The nationalists have been celebrating their self-declared
triumph since Sunday, raising tensions among the rival Bosnian Serb
camps. As Gelbard spoke, a few dozen nationalists drove through
Banja Luka streets, waving Serbian nationalist flags and blasting
Serbian folk songs over loudspeakers.
	   International officials warned against such demonstrations
Friday, hinting at possible punishment.
	   The OSCE has wide-ranging powers to impose sanctions against
parties _ even disqualify candidates who violate campaign rules.
	   But Western officials fear that disqualifying Poplasen could
trigger a violent reaction among his followers. Bosnian Serbs have
urged OSCE to release results, although Barry's office said that
could take another five or six days.
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists. Despite
millions of dollars in Western aid, little has trickled down to
rural Bosnian Serbs.

European Central Bank chief honored with top French award

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ European Central Bank President
Wim Duisenberg Friday received the Legion of Honor, one of France's
top awards.
	   France's ambassador to the Netherlands, Bernard de Montferrand,
awarded the medal to Duisenberg, making him a commander of the
Legion of Honor.
	   The award highlights individuals for their career achievement or
government service. Past recipients include director Martin
Scorsese, actor Robert De Niro, Olympic Committee President Juan
Antonio Samaranch and U.S. Ambassador Felix Rohatyn.
	   As the first director of the new European bank, Dutchman
Duisenberg oversees European monetary policy and is guiding 11
nations toward the switch to a common currency.
	   Duisenberg, a former Dutch finance minister and Dutch central
bank president, also headed the Frankfurt-based European Monetary
Institute until his appointment in May.
	   Ironically, it was the French who ignited much of the tumult in
the runup to Duisenberg's appointment by presenting Bank of France
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet as their candidate for the new central
bank post.
	   The squabble ended after French officials said they won a
promise from Duisenberg that he would quit halfway into the term to
make room for Trichet.
	   But Duisenberg later stressed that no deal had been made for his
early departure, but hinted that he would not serve his entire
eight-year term.
	   Trichet also attended Friday's award ceremony.

Lawyer: Lewinsky `concerned' for her country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky is ``concerned for her
country'' but is also relieved for the immunity provided her, a
lawyer for the former White House intern said in an interview
broadcast Friday.
	   ``She is not eager to be going through all these procedures,''
Plato Cacheris told Greece's Antenna television channel.
	   ``She is, of course, gratified that she herself is not involved
in any criminal sense. I think she's relieved for herself. She's
also concerned for the country,'' Cacheris said.
	   ``It's been a very painful process for this country,'' he added.
``I think most citizens wish it had not happened, and wish it could
end as quickly as possible. And me, as a citizen, I feel the same
way.''
	   Cacheris' interview aired hours after the House Judiciary
Committee voted to release the videotape of President Clinton's
grand jury testimony and an additional 2,800 pages of material,
including sexually explicit details of Clinton's relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.
	   The lawyer stressed his representation of Ms. Lewinsky was not
politically motivated. ``We had no agenda that was against
President Clinton,'' he said. ``Our task as lawyers ... was to
protect our client. We have done that.''
	   But he insisted he can have nothing to do with the result of the
ensuing scandal.
	   ``The consequences of that is something that I cannot concern
myself with,'' noted Cacheris, who is of Greek ancestry.
	   Cacheris, however, would not be drawn into the debate on whether
Clinton committed perjury in connection with the case. He also
refused to comment on whether it was necessary for the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, to include sexually explicit details in his
report.
	   ``He apparently felt it was necessary, so we'll leave it at
that,'' he told Antenna.
	   Ms. Lewinsky, who Cacheris described as ``a bright young lady
and very personable,'' has suffered from the case, he claimed.
	   ``She has been through a lot. She feels that,'' he said. ``She's
a young lady, and hopefully she will overcome this.''

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Calling the flood disaster in southern
Mexico grave but under control, President Ernesto Zedillo said the
government was rushing aid to hundreds of thousands of people
without food or shelter.
	   Zedillo has made four trips to Chiapas state since floods
devastated a Massachusetts-sized area last week along the coast,
killing at least 162 by Friday and leaving about 450,000 people
homeless.
	   Officials said 250,000 people will probably have to relocate
from their lowland houses and the government may have to build as
many as 25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed by the
flooding.
	   The death toll is expected to rise, officials said.
	   ``Four days ago, the situation was desperate, and today it is
under control,'' Zedillo said Thursday during his latest trip to
Chiapas. ``But the people are suffering much.''
	   While Zedillo ordered all government agencies to cooperate in
helping the victims, he chided independent aid groups. ``I have not
seen them here,'' he said.
	   The Red Cross and other groups have said flooded roads, wrecked
bridges, bad weather and a lack of transportation have hindered
their efforts to distribute aid.
	   All 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies, Mexico's lower house
of parliament, voted Thursday to donate a day's pay, about dlrs
160, to help the victims.
	   The Treasury Department also earmarked dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   The French government announced that they have sent dlrs 90,000
to the Mexican Red Cross. They also were sending a team to help
restore water plants.
	   Officials said they had made headway in restoring electricity
and repairing roads to the region, and had succeeded in restoring a
temporary land route from Tonala, at the north of the disaster
zone, to Pijijiapan, one of the hardest-hit towns.
	   Also Thursday, the federal department of fisheries and the
environment warned against eating seafood in some areas because of
contamination caused by dead animals in the rivers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Heeding international calls to fix its economy,
Japan's prime minister on Friday surrendered to opposition demands
on a set of crucial bank bills to strengthen the ailing financial
system.
	   The agreement increases the likelihood that banks enfeebled by
bad debt would be liquidated rather than rescued.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi leaves in two days for a summit in
New York with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and he has been eager to
break a deadlock with opposition parties on the bills package
before his departure.
	   The bills, seen as vital to prevent Japan from sinking further
into recession, seek to clean up some 80 trillion yen (dlrs 606
billion) in soured loans that are paralyzing the nation's banks and
threatening to send global markets on a tailspin.
	   ``As the country with the world's second-largest economy, I
determined that it wouldn't do for Japan to be the source of a
global meltdown,'' Obuchi said.
	   After two days of intense bargaining, Obuchi accepted the main
points of the opposition's counterproposal to the ruling party
plan.
	   The changes include stripping the Finance Ministry of powers to
chart the country's financial course and nationalizing the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's largest banks.
	   In addition, a 13 trillion-yen (dlrs 100 billion) pool of public
funds that had been set aside to prop up banks will be abolished,
making it harder for failing banks to receive government bailouts.
	   The opposition, which controls the upper house of Parliament and
can block the bills, had criticized the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's bank reform proposal, saying its ``soft landing'' approach
to use public funds to rescue banks was too lenient on bank
managers.
	   In spite of the breakthrough, some analysts said the agreement
was too vague and open to interpretation.
	   ``Just having measures in place doesn't mean they'll be used
efficiently,'' James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The compromise plan does not answer the question of how much
taxpayer money will be used to mop up bad debt at ailing banks. It
also does not say if public funds can be used to inject capital
into weak banks.
	   But others said the legislation was likely to make Japan's banks
more responsible.
	   ``Rather than doing nothing and simply applying for a public
fund injection, banks will try to improve their conditions by
themselves,'' Nozomu Kunishige of Lehman Brothers Japan told Dow
Jones.
	   Under intense pressure from abroad and from Japanese voters,
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party desperately needed an agreement
on the bills.
	   With Friday's agreement, most of the bills are expected to pass
next month during the current parliament session.
	   Caving into opposition demands represents a humiliating setback
at home for Obuchi, whose approval ratings are sinking.
	   Naoto Kan, the popular leader of the main opposition Democratic
Party, was triumphant after the negotiations were over.
	   ``Today's agreement basically represents the total acceptance of
the (opposition) parties' proposals,'' Kan said.
	   Still, Obuchi told reporters he was happy to have the chance to
explain to Clinton Japan's strategy to stabilize its financial
sector.
	   One of the biggest points of contention in the banking bills was
curtailing the powers of Japan's mighty Finance Ministry. The prime
minister agreed to opposition demands to transfer oversight of
financial markets from the ministry to a new committee by next
June.
	   Another was to let bad banks fail and limit the use of taxpayer
money to protect depositors and healthy borrowers.
	   The debate came to a head over a ruling party proposal to spend
public funds to bail out cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   The prime minister gave into opposition demands and decided that
public money will be used to clean up the bank's bad loans only
after placing it under government control _ effectively proclaiming
it bankrupt.

Council supports African peacekeeping, mediation efforts

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that wars in the Congo and
elsewhere in Africa threaten to spill over national borders, the
Security Council on Friday passed a resolution aimed at
strengthening regional peacekeeping and mediation efforts.
	   The resolution, approved 15-0, urged Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to help establish an ``early warning system'' and logistics
teams within the Organization of African Unity to try to target
conflicts before they reach a crisis point.
	   The OAU and other regional African groups have been trying to
help find a peaceful solution in the Congo, where rebels are
seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels, a charge
the countries deny. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, meanwhile, have
sent troops to help Kabila.
	   The resolution commended various initiatives taken by African
countries ``to enhance African preparedness to participate in the
military, police, humanitarian and other civilian components of
peacekeeping operations.''
	   The Security Council, mindful of the disastrous U.N. mission
Somalia, has been generally reluctant to approve U.N. peacekeeping
forces for African countries.
	   The council approved a mostly African peacekeeping force for the
Central African Republic in March. The force replaces French troops
who had been in the country to help enforce a peace agreement.
Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against President Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   In July, the council approved military observers to assist
Nigerian-led African peacekeepers who drove Sierra Leone's military
junta from power in February.

Hamas supporters clash with Israeli troops; 32 injured

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during the two-day
Jewish Near Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the
group's bomb makers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, the crowd stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement. Troops fired rubber
bullets, injuring 32 Palestinians, including one who was in serious
condition with a chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Ross held a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   After the meeting Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian
parliament, told The Associated Press ``Mr. Ross managed to bridge
the gaps on some issues,'' but Qureia did not elaborate.
	   Qureia added that the Palestinians may agree to delay their
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state next May 5 if their
negotiations with the Israelis are achieving progress.
	   If ``we agree with the Israelis that negotiations are going well
and there is a possibility of reaching an agreement, then the
declaration may be postponed for a month or two,'' he said.
	   It was the first time the Palestinians had agreed to such a
delay.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving for Washington on Saturday to brief U.S. President
Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.
	   Also Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered a Jewish West Bank
settler held until Sunday, on suspicion he shot to death an
17-year-old Palestinian in the village of Beitunia on Thursday.
	   The settler, Avshalom Ladani from the Dolev settlement, had
turned himself in several hours after the shooting. Ladani had been
driving through Beitunia when the incident occurred.
	   Loudness lawyer, Yair Golan, said his client acted in
self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, and that he shot
only in the air.
	   However, Palestinians said Ladani opened fire unprovoked,
seriously wounding two Palestinian teen-age boys who were walking
home from school. One of the injured, Iyad Kabasma, died of his
wounds at Ramallah Hospital on Thursday afternoon, while a second
boy remained in stable condition.
	   Kabasma was buried Friday afternoon in the village of Ein Arik
near Beitunia, and hundreds of mourners chanted ``long live the
rifle.'' A wall slogan in the village signed by Arafat's Fatah
movement read, ``Shame to those who support co-existence with the
occupiers.''

Ford Argentina to cut production due to declining sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Ford Motor Co.'s Argentine unit
beginning Monday will cut production for the ``foreseeable
future,'' a company official said.
	   ``We're reducing production and suspending 1,400 workers on full
pay until market conditions improve,'' Ford Argentina Institutional
Relations Director Rodolfo Ceretti said Friday.
	   The cuts at Ford's General Pacheco plant north of Buenos Aires
come as a result of a 15 percent decline in sales to the domestic
market and about 35 percent less demand from Brazil, Ceretti said.
	   He said Ford would cut production of its Escort model from 489
units daily to 300 units assembled in one shift, instead of the
current two.
	   The suspensions begin Monday and run until the plant shuts down
for the Christmas period _ Dec. 14 to Jan. 4 _ and then will
continue until ``sales pick up again,'' said Ceretti.
	   He said the suspension of 1,400 employees from a work force of
3,570 would cost Ford an estimated dlrs 1 million per month in
salaries.
	   ``It's a lot of money, but if you consider how much we would
have to pay in indemnities if we fire them, it's a much cheaper
option,'' said Ceretti. But he added, ``If market conditions
deepen, firing might become an option.''
	   Under Argentine labor laws, a company must pay each dismissed
worker one month's salary for each year of employment.
	   As reported, Ford in September suspended production of its
Escort line for four days as a result of weakened demand since the
start of Asia's financial crisis and its effect on Brazil. That
suspension affected 2,000 workers.
	   Ford's latest move to cut production comes on the heels of a
similar announcement Tuesday by Italian auto maker Fiat's local
unit that closed its plant in the central province of Cordoba for
the fourth time since July.
	   Also, the local unit of French car maker Renault said Wednesday
it plans to halt production at its plant in Cordoba for three days.

Lawyer: Lewinsky `concerned' for her country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky is ``concerned for her
country'' but is also relieved for the immunity provided her, a
lawyer for the former White House intern said in an interview
broadcast in Greece on Friday.
	   ``She is not eager to be going through all these procedures,''
Plato Cacheris told Greece's private Antenna television channel.
	   ``She is, of course, gratified that she herself is not involved
in any criminal sense. I think she's relieved for herself. She's
also concerned for the country,'' Cacheris, who is of Greek
ancestry, said in Washington.
	   Cacheris' interview aired hours after the House Judiciary
Committee voted to release the videotape of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's grand jury testimony and an additional 2,800 pages of
material, including sexually explicit details of Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   ``It's been a very painful process for this country,'' Cacheris
said. ``I think most citizens wish it had not happened, and wish it
could end as quickly as possible. And me, as a citizen, I feel the
same way.''
	   The lawyer stressed his representation of Ms. Lewinsky was not
politically motivated. ``We had no agenda that was against
President Clinton. Our task as lawyers ... was to protect our
client.''
	   Cacheris would not be drawn into the debate on whether Clinton
committed perjury in the case. He also refused to comment on
whether it was necessary for the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, to include sexually explicit details in his report.
	   ``He apparently felt it was necessary, so we'll leave it at
that,'' he told Antenna.
	   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, whom Cacheris described as ``a bright young
lady and very personable,'' has suffered from the case, he said.
	   ``She has been through a lot,'' he said. ``Hopefully she will
overcome this.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky replaced her attorney William Ginsburg in June with
Washington lawyers Cacheris and Jacob Stein.

Swissair says expects dozens of lawsuits, defends plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLATTBRUGG, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair expects dozens of
lawsuits as a result of the crash of Flight 111, which killed all
299 people on board, airline officials said Friday.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of the SAir Group parent
company, said it would likely be weeks _ if not months _ before
there were reliable clues about the cause of the Sept. 2 accident
off the coast of Canada.
	   Speculation has focused on defective wiring in the cockpit after
the pilot reported smoke in the cabin. Both flight data and cockpit
voice recorders stopped six minutes before the plane plunged into
the ocean. The MD-11 smashed into tiny pieces on impact.
	   The wiring question is likely to play a key role in future
lawsuits against Swissair and Boeing Corp., which took over MD-11
manufacturer McDonnell Douglas.
	   So far only one lawsuit has been filed _ a claim for dlrs 50
million by former U.S. boxer Jake LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   Karin Anderegg Bigger, chief of SAir legal services, said the
group expected dozens more to follow. There were many senior
businessmen, scientists and U.N. personnel on the plane from New
York to Geneva.
	   ``We are well insured,'' said Bruggisser.
	   Anderegg Bigger said Swissair held preliminary talks with
Canadian authorities and local fishermen Thursday on how to help
350 fishermen facing a financial crisis as a result of the
accident.
	   The crash came at the height of the main fishing season and
meant that some of Nova Scotia's best fishing grounds have been
sealed off for the duration of the investigation.
	   At a press conference near the Swiss city of Zurich, Bruggisser
defended the record of the MD-11. Out of a worldwide total of 3.5
million flight hours there had been only two serious crashes _ the
Swissair disaster and a crash involving a U.S. Federal Express
carrier last year, in which pilot error was suspected.
	   He said 178 of the aircraft remained in operation worldwide.

Council extends U.N. force in Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed Friday to keep
a U.N. force in Western Sahara for another month and urged the
repatriation of voters for an upcoming referendum on the disputed
territory's political status.
	   In a resolution, the 15-member council voted unanimously to
extend the mandate of the U.N. force through Oct. 31.
	   Western Sahara is the disputed area of North Africa claimed by
Morocco and a rebel group known as the Polisario Front, which wants
independence for the indigenous people.
	   Morocco has laid claim to the territory based on historical
links to sheiks of generations gone by. Morocco has poured money
and 350,000 immigrants into the area since the departure of the
territory's colonial ruler, Spain, in 1975.
	   The desert territory has camels, goats, sheep and not many
people _ an average of about two for each of its 100,000 square
miles (260,000 square kilometers). Its main natural resource is
phosphate, an ingredient in fertilizer.
	   U.N. observers were sent there in 1991 to maintain a cease-fire
and to facilitate the referendum by identifying voters eligible to
cast ballots. The two sides disagree over who is eligible to vote.
	   Under the accord, tribal chiefs are to help the United Nations
determine who is a genuine resident of Western Sahara and thus
eligible to vote. The territory's population was largely nomadic
before Morocco took over.
	   When the referendum takes place, the choice will be between
independence and integration with Morocco.
	   In a report Tuesday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was
pleased with the process of identification but added that
administrative difficulties were impeding progress toward holding
the referendum.
	   The council called for the swift resolution of those problems
and asked both sides allow the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
be allowed to do its work to repatriate people to vote.
	   It welcomed action by Moroccan authorities to ``formalize the
presence'' of the UNHCR.
	   In a statement, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he
strongly supported U.N. envoy James Baker III's ``further
engagement ... in the settlement plan process.''
	   Baker, a former U.S. secretary of state, brokered the settlement
which includes the referendum.
	   ``We urge the parties to work constructively with him to bring
this long-standing dispute to a comprehensive and mutually
agreeable conclusion,'' Burleigh said.

	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican soldiers and police stood guard
Friday outside the hospital room where Fermin Castro lay in a coma
with bullet wounds suffered in the execution-style killing of 18
members of his extended family.
	   Castro apparently was the target of the attack Thursday morning,
and although police said they hadn't linked him to drug
trafficking, a respected weekly from nearby Tijuana reported Friday
that the government believed he and two other victims were
smugglers.
	   Zeta magazine said Castro was a marijuana smuggler, and had
small airplanes that landed on airstrips in the desert east of
Ensenada. It attributed the report to a confidential report by the
federal attorney general's office drawn up five months ago.
	   Castro, alias ``The Iceman,'' answered to Ismael Higuera
Guerrero, a lieutenant of the drug gang led by the Arellano Felix
brothers, Zeta cited the report as saying.
	   The magazine also said Castro's sister Sandra and her husband,
Francisco Flores Altamirano, were involved in drug smuggling. She
would drive ahead of her husband, who would have the cargo, to
advise him of police checkpoints, Zeta said.
	   The couple died in the shootout Thursday morning, in which 12
men dressed in black reportedly pulled up to Castro's compound,
lined up members of his extended family and told them to lie
face-down, then shot them all.
	   Only two children survived with Castro.
	   Castro's relatives on Friday waited in the parking lot of the
hospital wearing cowboy hats. They denied he had drug ties and said
he had no known enemies.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   They described Castro as a man who liked betting and made
frequent trips to the southwestern United States. His trips to
Arizona, Nevada and other states were tours to see farm animals and
ranches there, they said.
	   Although police said they had no suspects in the massacre in the
nearby middle-class suburb of El Sauzal, family members said
several ranch hands who lived in the family compound had been
detained.
	   It was unclear whether the workers were present at the time of
the massacre or whether they had been given the day off for
Mexico's independence holiday.
	   Mexican and foreign news media suggested a possible drug motive
in the deaths.
	   A local radio station cited traditional punishments among drug
traffickers in which smugglers who changed sides from one
organization to another would have their entire family killed.
	   Local news media also cited a supposed quarrel between Castro
and unidentified men that occurred at Independence Day celebrations
on the eve of the massacre.
	   Police said Castro had been under investigation in the past for
reasons they would not disclose. ``He was involved in something,''
said federal highway police Capt. Fernando Rodriguez Goni, implying
that ``something'' was illegal.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   Eight children and 10 adults died in the massacre, including
Macaria Jaime Tovar, who family members said was eight months
pregnant.
	   The only survivors included 12-year-old Mario Alberto Flores _
who suffered unspecified but serious injuries _ and Viviana Flores,
15, who apparently escaped unharmed.
	   It was unclear whether she was the 15-year-old girl who police
have said survived the attack by hiding under a bed.

Holyfield comes home, and fills the seats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ As an 8-year-old, Evander Holyfield wasn't
interested in the most significant fight in Atlanta history.
	   At 35, he is pleased to participate in the biggest fight _ in
terms of attendance _ ever held in his hometown.
	   It is a tribute to Holyfield that at least 30,000 tickets will
be sold for his IBF-WBA heavyweight title defense against Vaughn
Bean in the Georgia Dome.
	   Bean, who built a 32-1 record fighting inferior opponents, is a
decided underdog.
	   ``I don't think he's overlooking me,'' Bean said. ``He loves his
job.''
	   On Oct. 26, 1970, seven days after Holyfield's eighth birthday,
Muhammad Ali stopped Jerry Quarry in the third round at the
5,000-seat Civic Auditorium. The fight attracted national attention
because it was Ali's return from 3 1-2 years of banishment from
boxing because of his conviction for evading the military draft.
	   ``When I was a kid I didn't pay any attention to boxing unless I
was boxing,'' said Holyfield, who at 8 began boxing in age-group
competition.
	   Boxing fans have long paid attention to Holyfield. And now the
public is, too, in the wake of his two victories over Mike Tyson
and the notoriety of the Bite Fight.
	   ``He's a good champion, a good guy,'' said Joe Frazier, the
former heavyweight champion, who is helping train the 25-year-old
Bean. ``The world looks up to him. He's a clean guy. He ranks right
up there with all the great champions.''
	   This will be the second time in 15 fights, beginning with his
third-round knockout to become heavyweight champion Oct. 25, 1990,
that Holyfield has fought in Atlanta. The first time was when he
stopped Bert Cooper in the seventh round Nov. 23, 1991.
	   That fight wasn't the kind for which casinos in Las Vegas and
Atlantic City, New Jersey are willing to pay huge live-site fees.
Saturday night's isn't either. The bout is being held because Bean
is the IBF's No. 1 contender and Holyfield would be stripped of
that organization's title if he didn't take the fight.
	   Still, Holyfield is happy to be fighting before the home folks,
and they obviously are pleased to have him back.
	   Scheduled to watch the homecoming in the Georgia Dome, as guests
of promoter Don King, are the 12 jurors who recently acquitted King
of insurance fraud. The jurors and their spouses also have been
treated by King to a trip to the Bahamas.
	   Holyfield is guaranteed dlrs 3.5 million by Showtime, and
because of the good ticket sale he should make at least dlrs 5
million. Bean's purse will be dlrs 1.8 million.
	   Holyfield's purses for the two Tyson fights were dlrs 11 million
and dlrs 35 million, respectively, and his payday for the Moorer
fight was dlrs 20 million. All three of those bouts were
pay-per-view.
	   The champion weighed 217 pounds (98 kgs), three more than he
weighed when he retained the WBA title and won the IBF title by
stopping Michael Moorer in the eight rounds last November.
	   Bean, of Chicago, weighed 231 pounds (104 kgs), seven above his
previous high weight and 19 more than he weighed when he lost a
majority decision to Moorer in an IBF title bid in 1997.
	   The 12-round bout is to start 15 minutes after a 12-round
middleweight fight between Robert Allen of Atlanta and Abdul
Ramadan of Toronto that will open the telecast.

Kafelnikov, top seeds move into President's Cup semifinals.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
outplayed Gaston Etlis of Argentine and Briton Tim Henman outdueled
Italian Stephano Pescosolido on Friday to advance to the semifinals
of the dlrs 500,000 President's Cup tournament on the ATP tour.
	   The No. 1-seeded Kafelnikov ended Gaston Etlis with a 6-3, 3-6,
6-1 victory.
	   ``My main opponents at this tournament are Tim Henman and Cedric
Pioline. The fact that they are my friends does not mean a thing.
Victory in this tournament will be of high prestige to me,''
Kafelnikov said at a news conference after the match.
	   The victory earned Kafelnikov a semifinal berth against Cedric
Pioline, the No. 3 seed.
	   Pioline overcame sixth-seeded Marat Safin of Russia 6-7 (6-3),
6-2, 7-6 (6-3). Earlier this year, Pioline eliminated Safin in a
tough five-setter in the third round in the French Open.
	   The No. 2-seed, Tim Henman of Great Britain, downed Italian
Stefano Pescosolido in straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
	   ``Recently I have improved my playing. This tournament has
become a talisman to me. I hope it will become a tradition,''
Henman told a news conference after the match.
	   Henman will play in the other semifinal against the fourth seed
French Nicolas Escude.
	   The fifth day of the tournament drew about 3,000 spectators.

Swissair says expects dozens of lawsuits, defends plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLATTBRUGG, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair expects dozens of
lawsuits as a result of the crash of Flight 111, which killed all
229 people on board, airline officials said Friday.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of the SAir Group parent
company, said it would likely be weeks _ if not months _ before
there were reliable clues about the cause of the Sept. 2 accident
off the coast of Canada.
	   Speculation has focused on defective wiring in the cockpit after
the pilot reported smoke in the cabin. Both flight data and cockpit
voice recorders stopped six minutes before the plane plunged into
the ocean. The MD-11 smashed into tiny pieces on impact.
	   The wiring question is likely to play a key role in future
lawsuits against Swissair and Boeing Corp., which took over MD-11
manufacturer McDonnell Douglas.
	   So far only one lawsuit has been filed _ a claim for dlrs 50
million by former U.S. boxer Jake LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   Karin Anderegg Bigger, chief of SAir legal services, said the
group expected dozens more to follow. There were many senior
businessmen, scientists and U.N. personnel on the plane from New
York to Geneva.
	   ``We are well insured,'' said Bruggisser.
	   Anderegg Bigger said Swissair held preliminary talks with
Canadian authorities and local fishermen Thursday on how to help
350 fishermen facing a financial crisis as a result of the
accident.
	   The crash came at the height of the main fishing season and
meant that some of Nova Scotia's best fishing grounds have been
sealed off for the duration of the investigation.
	   At a press conference near the Swiss city of Zurich, Bruggisser
defended the record of the MD-11. Out of a worldwide total of 3.5
million flight hours there had been only two serious crashes _ the
Swissair disaster and a crash involving a U.S. Federal Express
carrier last year, in which pilot error was suspected.
	   He said 178 of the aircraft remained in operation worldwide.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose modestly on Wall Street Friday,
halting a selling spree that swept markets worldwide Thursday and
was extended in Europe and most of Asia.
	   In an exception to the overseas losses, Tokyo's main stock index
managed a small rebound from Thursday's 12-year low.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.89 at 7,895.66 in
heavy trading. In yet another turbulent week, the Dow managed to
rise 100.16 points.
	   Broader indicators also rose, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index posting the sharpest gain.
	   Trading was in a relatively narrow range, with the Dow up as
much as 56.90 in the early going, then falling to a loss of as much
as 45.83 this afternoon before recovering late in the day.
	   The climb left the Dow slightly below where it began the year,
at 7,908.25, and still 15.4 percent beneath its July 17 record high
of 9,337.97.
	   The Dow plunged, 6th graf

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Spaniard Francisco Clavet defeated his
countryman Julian Alonso on Friday to become the only seeded player
to advance to the semifinals of the dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open.
	   Top-seeded Clavet upset Alonso, seeded eighth, 7-5, 6-0. Alonso
took on Clavet's strong serves in the first set, but couldn't keep
the pace and lost the second set.
	   Another Spaniard, Albert Portas advanced to the semifinals,
where he'll meet Clavet. Portas struggled hard to defeat Romanian
Andrei Pavel Friday. Pavel led the match in the first set, but
tired and lost concentration as the game advanced, finally losing
to the Spaniard 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
	   In the other semifinals match, Arnaud Di Pasquale of France will
meet Romanian Adrian Voinea.
	   Di Pasquale ousted Spaniard Galo Blanco 7-6 (7-2), 2-6. 6-2
Friday. The Frenchman played strong in the first set, before
relaxing to win the second easily. Voinea upset Emilio Alvarez of
Spain 6-4, 6-1. Voinea remained the only Romanian in tournament out
of seven who started play in the men's clay tournament.

Israel releases spy on humanitarian grounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel Friday released an ailing Soviet spy
from prison on humanitarian grounds but he is to remain under
secret service supervision, his lawyer said.
	   Eighty-year-old Marcus Klingberg, was ordered released on Sept.
9, but remained in custody to give the state a chance to appeal
against the court's ruling.
	   He was freed Friday because no appeal had been submitted, his
lawyer Avigdor Feldman said.
	   He had served 15 years of a 20-year term for passing biological
weapons secrets to the Soviet Union. An Israeli newspaper described
Klingberg as the spy who caused the greatest damage to Israel in
its 50-year history.
	   The three judges of the Beersheba District Court had been told
by agents of the Shin Bet security service that Klingberg still
posed a threat to security and must not be allowed to leave prison.
However, the judges said humanitarian considerations in this case
had greater weight.
	   Klingberg has suffered several strokes.
	   The court accepted the state's request that Klingberg must hire
at his own expense a care-giver approved by the Shin Bet. Klingberg
may not leave his Tel Aviv house for more than two hours each day
and only have contact with 11 people.
	   His phone will be tapped by the Shin Bet, Feldman told The
Associated Press.
	   Klingberg was arrested and tried in secret in 1983 and was
imprisoned under a false name until foreign media reports forced
Israel to acknowledge the case in the late 1980s.
	   He reportedly began spying for the Soviet Union in 1957, at a
time when he already was working at Israel's secretive Institute
for Biological Research in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona. The
institute reportedly develops chemical and biological weapons and
their antidotes. The Haaretz daily said Klingberg broke off contact
with the KGB in 1976.

Council discusses Libya travel ban violations; negotiations to
</HEADLINE>
bring suspects to trial &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council expressed concern
Friday over recent violations of a U.N. ban on flights to Libya as
negotiations on a proposal to try two Libyan suspects in the 1988
Pan Am Lockerbie bombing continued.
	   A delegation of Nigerian Cabinet ministers flew to the North
African country Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported,
the latest group to violate U.N. sanctions since the Organization
of African Unity announced in June it would ignore the flight ban.
	   Earlier this month, five African presidents flew to the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, for celebrations marking the anniversary of the
1969 coup that brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   After discussing the issue Friday, council president Hans
Dahlgren of Sweden said council members ``reiterated the importance
that they attach to the implementations of ... council
resolutions.''
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am
passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   In addition to the flight ban, the sanctions also bar arms
sales, freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry
equipment.
	   Libya this week asked the Arab League to join the OAU in
ignoring the sanctions. But the 22-member league said it would not
agree to suspend the sanctions until an agreement is reached on
handing over the suspects for trial.
	   The council said the sanctions would be lifted when the suspects
were turned over for trial.
	   A U.S.-British proposal made last month calls for the two
suspects to be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges
according to Scottish law.
	   Britain and the Netherlands signed an agreement Friday at The
Hague on the conditions for the trial.
	   The U.S.-British proposal, backed by a Security Council
resolution, calls for the men to be imprisoned in Britain if
convicted. The Tripoli government has said it wants the men
imprisoned in Libya if convicted.
	   ``Unfortunately, we have received no positive response to date
from Libyan authorities,'' said Peter Burleigh, deputy American
ambassador.
	   Libya recently asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan to help
clarify how witnesses would be called to testify and where the two
suspects would serve their sentences if convicted.
	   Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said discussions were ongoing.
``We hope we can satisfy them on the fine print they have asked for
clarification on,'' he said.

Bomb explodes in Algerian market, killing 22

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a market on the
edge of the city of Tiaret on Friday, killing 22 people and
injuring 30 others, hospital sources said.
	   The attack was announced in a brief statement from Algerian
security forces. The statement said seven of the injured were in
serious condition.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb
which went off about 5 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   Residents of Tiaret, reached by telephone, said the security
forces were searching the area, about 310 kilometers (190 miles)
southeast of the capital Algiers. The hospital sources and the
residents spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   No further details were immediately available on the attack.
	   The explosion was the latest in an upsurge in violence in
Algeria that has occurred following the decision by President
Liamine Zeroual last week to step down and call early elections.
	   Zeroual, a former general, has been unable to put a stop to
violence that erupted in 1992 after an Islamic insurgency broke out
after the military canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic
party was set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have been killed in violence since then.
	   This week, a U.N. fact-finding team released the results of an
inquiry conducted this summer. The group condemned what it called
extremism that has spurred the violence, but it also called on the
government to exercise greater control on the security forces,
which have been accused of carrying out some of the attacks.
	   The report was immediately criticized by the human rights group
Amnesty International, which called it a whitewash and said the
U.N. team had failed to address key human rights abuses.

	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ While authorities say they haven't tied
the massacre of 18 family members to drugs, a respected Mexican
journalist said Friday that those same officials have known since
June that the target belonged to Mexico's most feared drug gang.
	   The magazine Zeta identified Fermin Castro as a member of of the
Arellano Felix drug gang in June and said he was known as ``The
Iceman.'' It cited a confidential report by the federal attorney
general's office.
	   ``I can't understand why, having all that information in their
hands, they didn't do anything,'' Zeta publisher Jesus Blancornelos
said in an interview on Mexico's Televisa network. The magazine is
published in Tijuana, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of the beach
resort of Ensanada, where Castro's family members were killed
Thursday.
	   Castro was in a coma Friday, guarded by police and soldiers,
after the pre-dawn attack. Eight children and 10 adults _ all
members of Castro's extended family _ were killed after the gunmen
pulled them from their beds, forced them to lie face down on a
patio and opened fire.
	   Other than Castro, the only survivors were 12-year-old Mario
Alberto Flores _ who was in serious condition _ and Viviana Flores,
15, who apparently escaped unharmed.
	   Relatives waited in the parking lot of the hospital on Friday
wearing cowboy hats and leaning on their pickup trucks. They denied
Castro had drug ties and said he had no known enemies.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   They described Castro as a man who liked betting and made
frequent trips to the southwestern United States to see farm
animals and ranches there.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   Authorities would not confirm drug smuggling as a motive in the
massacre. The Baja California state attorney general, Marco Antonio
de la Fuente Villarreal, said Thursday that ``we cannot say 100
percent that it was an aspect of drug trafficking.''
	   But Zeta cited government documents in reporting that Castro had
small drug-smuggling airplanes that landed on airstrips in the
desert east of Ensenada.
	   Castro answered to Ismael Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the
Arellano Felix brothers, Zeta cited the report as saying.
	   The magazine also said Castro's sister Sandra and her husband,
Francisco Flores Altamirano, were involved in drug smuggling. She
would drive ahead of her husband, who would carry the cargo, to
advise him of police checkpoints, Zeta said. Both died in the
massacre.
	   Blancornelos would not speculate as to whether the massacre
might have been carried out by the Arellano Felix gang or by one of
its rivals. But he did say the attack wasn't a typical drug hit.
	   ``There's an unspoken rule among drug smugglers that children
are untouchable,'' he said.
	   A local radio station cited what it said were traditional
punishments among drug traffickers in which smugglers who changed
sides from one organization to another would have their entire
family killed.
	   Police said they had made no arrests and had no suspects in the
attack. But Castro's family members said several ranch hands who
lived in the family compound had been detained.
	   It was unclear whether the workers were present at the time of
the massacre or whether they had been given the day off for
Mexico's independence holiday.

Israel releases spy on health grounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel released an ailing Soviet spy from
prison Friday on humanitarian grounds but he is to remain under
secret service supervision, his lawyer said.
	   Eighty-year-old Marcus Klingberg, who has suffered several
strokes, was ordered released on Sept. 9 but remained in custody to
give the state a chance to appeal.
	   No appeal was submitted so he was released, his lawyer Avigdor
Feldman said.
	   Klingberg had served 15 years of a 20-year term for passing
biological weapons secrets to the Soviet Union. An Israeli
newspaper described Klingberg as the spy who caused the greatest
damage to Israel in its 50-year history.
	   The Shin Bet security service argued that Klingberg still posed
a security threat and must not be freed from prison. However, the
Beersheba District Court ruled that humanitarian considerations had
greater weight.
	   Klingberg must hire a care-giver approved by Shin Bet. Klingberg
cannot leave his Tel Aviv house for more than two hours each day
and can only have contact with 11 people.
	   His phone will be tapped by Shin Bet, Feldman said.

 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS Tonga scorers in last graf after official scoring
change &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia scored 42 second-half points
to open the rugby union World Cup Pacific qualifying tournament
Friday with a 66-20 win over Fiji at Parramatta Stadium.
	   Earlier at the same ground, Western Samoa scored a 28-20 win
over Tonga in the first rugby union doubleheader to be played in
Australia.
	   Damian Smith and Stephen Larkham scored two tries each in
Australia's nine-try demolition of Fiji while captain John Eales
converted all the tries and kicked a penalty.
	   Australia led 24-6 lead at halftime. Solid Fijian defense kept
the Wallabies scoreless for the first 22 minutes until Smith scored
the first of Australia's three first-half tries. Winger Jason
Little fielded a George Gregan chip over the Fijian defenders to
cross in the 36th minute.
	   In the first match, it took Va'aiga Tuigamala only two minutes
to remind Australian fans of his power when he set up the
match-stealing try in the Western Samoa win over Tonga.
	   Both sides scored three tries but Samoan five-eighth Stephen
Bachop was the difference with three penalties and two conversions.
	   Former All Black winger Tuigamala came on as a replacement in
the 60th minute with Samoa leading 18-8 but under enormous pressure
from the physical Tongans.
	   Two minutes later, he charged onto a path inside the 22,
delivered on the other side of halfway with center Terry Fanolua
finishing off by crashing over in the corner. Bachop's sideline
conversion gave Samoa an unattainable 25-8 lead.
	   It was Tuigamala's first game in Australia since he played for
New Zealand here in 1992 and his fourth test for his native Samoa
since he returned to rugby two years ago following a four-year
stint in rugby league.
	   ``We haven't had a game leading up to this game so we were very
rusty and our lineout throws weren't quite finding the mark, but I
always felt we had the answers,'' said Western Samoan coach Bryan
Williams.
	   ``We turned up the heat after halftime and controlled the ball a
lot better and it started to work for us.''
	   The top three teams in the tournament qualify directly for next
year's World Cup, with the fourth getting a second chance via
another qualifying round.
	   The tournament moves to Canberra on Tuesday with Australia
meeting Tonga and Western Samoa facing Fiji at Bruce Stadium.
	   Scores:
	   AUSTRALIA 66 (Damian Smith 2, Stephen Larkham 2, Jason Little,
Owen Finegan, Joe Roff, Nathan Grey, Jeremy Paul tries, John Eales
9 goals, penalty goal) def. FIJI 20 (Sale Sorovaki, Waisale Serevi
tries, Waisale Serevi 2 goals, 2 penalty goals).
	   WESTERN SAMOA 28 (Steven So'oialo, Brian Lima, Terry Fanolua

	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ While authorities say they haven't tied
the massacre of 18 family members to drugs, a respected Mexican
journalist said Friday that those same officials have known since
June that the target belonged to Mexico's most feared drug gang.
	   The magazine Zeta identified Fermin Castro as a member of of the
Arellano Felix drug gang in June and said he was known as ``The
Iceman.'' It cited a confidential report by the federal attorney
general's office.
	   ``I can't understand why, having all that information in their
hands, they didn't do anything,'' Zeta publisher Jesus Blancornelas
said in an interview on Mexico's Televisa network. The magazine is
published in Tijuana, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of the beach
resort of Ensanada, where Castro's family members were killed
Thursday.
	   Castro was in a coma Friday, guarded by police and soldiers,
after the pre-dawn attack. Eight children and 10 adults _ all
members of Castro's extended family _ were killed after the gunmen
pulled them from their beds, forced them to lie face down on a
patio and opened fire.
	   Other than Castro, the only survivors were 12-year-old Mario
Alberto Flores _ who was in serious condition _ and Viviana Flores,
15, who apparently escaped unharmed.
	   Relatives waited in the parking lot of the hospital on Friday
wearing cowboy hats and leaning on their pickup trucks. They denied
Castro had drug ties and said he had no known enemies.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   They described Castro as a man who liked betting and made
frequent trips to the southwestern United States to see farm
animals and ranches there.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, one that dwarfed surrounding
houses.
	   Authorities would not confirm drug smuggling as a motive in the
massacre. The Baja California state attorney general, Marco Antonio
de la Fuente Villarreal, said Thursday that ``we cannot say 100
percent that it was an aspect of drug trafficking.''
	   But Zeta cited government documents in reporting that Castro had
small drug-smuggling airplanes that landed on airstrips in the
desert east of Ensenada.
	   Castro answered to Ismael Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the
Arellano Felix brothers, Zeta cited the report as saying.
	   The magazine also said Castro's sister Sandra and her husband,
Francisco Flores Altamirano, were involved in drug smuggling. She
would drive ahead of her husband, who would carry the cargo, to
advise him of police checkpoints, Zeta said. Both died in the
massacre.
	   Blancornelas would not speculate as to whether the massacre
might have been carried out by the Arellano Felix gang or by one of
its rivals. But he did say the attack wasn't a typical drug hit.

Nicaraguan president tries to defuse fraud controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ President Arnoldo Aleman tried to
distance himself Friday from fraud allegations made by the attorney
general against the Nicaraguan controller.
	   ``The executive branch has nothing against the controller's
office. We support it as an institution,'' Aleman said.
	   Aleman spoke briefly to reporters briefly during a ceremony
honoring Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo at La Libertad, the
prelate's hometown in western Chontales province.
	   ``The news media are making it look as if there were a boxing
match between the executive and the controller. I want to make it
clear it is not the executive branch or the president, but the
institutions that are taking action,'' he said.
	   Attorney General Julio Centeno Gomez filed complaints in the
National Assembly's anti-corruption commission this week against
controller-general Agustin Jarquin, accusing him of ``bribery,
misuse of public funds, embezzlement, fraud and other illegal
spending.''
	   The commission can investigate the complaints and make
recommendations, but has no enforcement power. Centeno Gomez says
he may file charges in court.
	   Jarquin has denied wrongdoing.
	   Aleman has been feuding with the controller, accusing him of
pursuing ``small crimes of the government'' while ignoring
allegedly larger crimes committed by the past administration.
	   Jarquin has accused Aleman's administration of trying to
intimidate his agency into ignoring cases of corruption.
	   Centeno Gomez said the controller's office had received about
dlrs 195,000 in irregular payments from several public agencies,
including the power company and the telephone company during the
final months of the administration of former President Violeta
Chamorro in 1996.
	   He said funds were used for advertising, the purchase of
communications equipment, trips and other uses rather than for
audits as called for by law.
	   Jarquin has insisted the spending was legal.
	   The law gives the controller immunity from prosecution, but
Jarquin has said he is willing to renounce that right to defend
himself.

Michael Preetz lifts Berlin into second
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hertha Berlin sent three strikers and three
offensive-minded midfielders onto the pitch Friday and cashed in
with three goals to beat Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.
	   Michael Preetz, hampered by a leg injury, scored two of them in
a 3-1 victory that lifted Berlin into second place in the table.
	   But Berlin, playing with just one defender because of injuries,
was helped in the first half when Frankfurt failed to capitalize on
numerous scoring chances.
	   Frankfurt's Chen Yang, the first Chinese player in the
Bundesliga, blasted his second season goal under the crossbar in
the 13th minute, but Preetz headed the equalizer 14 minutes later.
	   Preetz then struck again in the 55th minute with a chip shot as
Berlin dominated the second half against newly-promoted Frankfurt.
Playing in front of 44,000 spectators, Hertha remained unbeaten in
three outings at Oylmpiastadium.
	   After Frankfurt's Thomas Sobotzik was sent off in the 63rd
minute for elbowing Preetz, Cameroon's Alphonse Tchami added a
third goal for Berlin in the 81st minute.
	   After a tough first season of promotion, this year Berlin has
eked out nine points in five rounds against three UEFA Cup sides
and Borussia Dortmund.
	   Tunisia's Adel Sellimi lifted Freiburg past Rostock with seven
minutes to play. Alexander Iaschwili then added an insurance goal
in the 90th.

Mexican president clashes with Red Cross over aid delivery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with president and Red Cross
clashing over aid. DELETES outdated material. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ The Mexican Red Cross clashed with
Mexico's president Friday over the delivery of donated aid to
destitute flood victims in southern Chiapas state.
	   During a visit to Chiapas on Thursday, President Ernesto Zedillo
had pointed to a woman wearing a Red Cross insignia and said he had
yet to see ``a single kilo'' of the goods collected by Mexico City
Red Cross volunteers arrive in Chiapas
	   In response, the charity group's president blamed the
government, saying the army and navy had refused to provide air
transportation to volunteers trying to deliver supplies to the
coastal region, where flooding broke apart the state's road system.
	   ``With Hurricane Pauline last year, we had the support of the
army and the navy, but that was not the case this time,'' Jose
Barroso said.
	   An estimated 450,000 people have been left homeless by last
week's flooding, which devastated an area the size of
Massachusetts. Officials have confirmed 162 deaths and expect the
toll to rise as reports come in from isolated towns.
	   Barroso said the army had decided to distribute the government's
own food and water supplies to people left homeless by the floods,
leaving the Red Cross on its own.
	   ``Through our own efforts, we have been sending aid on boats and
trains,'' he said.
	   So far, the group has managed to send 1,020 tons (925 metric
tons) of the 1,815 tons (1,645 metric tons) of aid it has
collected, Barroso said. In the process, it has exhausted its
emergency fund of nearly dlrs 130,000, but has received an
additional dlrs 75,000 in donations from across Mexico.
	   Critics of the government have accused it of impeding
independent aid efforts in Chiapas because some communities are
sympathetic toward leftist rebels in the eastern part of the state
since rising up in 1994.
	   Barroso declined to say whether he thought that was the case.
	   Zedillo's office had no comment Friday on the Red Cross
rebuttal.
	   At the Red Cross' Mexico City headquarters, more than 4,400
volunteers were working feverishly to collect and sort donations of
food, water, medicine and other supplies.
	   Noemi Tiktim, a native of Poland who fled Europe during World
War II, brought boxes of supplies donated by the city's large
Jewish community.
	   ``Because of what our people have gone through, we know the
suffering brought about by the lack of food and water,'' she said.
``I survived the Holocaust. ... The least one can do while being
alive is to help the other fellow.''
	   Zedillo, who has made four trips to Chiapas since last week, has
described the situation as grave but under control.
	   Officials said 250,000 people probably will have to relocate
from their lowland houses and the government may have to build as
many as 25,000 low-cost homes to replace those destroyed by the
flooding.

Canadian officer appointed to lead UN troops in Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ A Canadian soldier has been appointed to lead a
United Nations peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights.
	   Brig. Gen. Cameron Ross was U.N. Secretary-General Koffi Annan's
choice to lead the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force,
which has been in place since 1974 to maintain a cease fire between
Israel and Syria.
	   Israel wrested the strategic region on its northern border from
Syria in 1973.
	   Ross, who is currently the commander of the Canadian military's
land forces in the Atlantic, will take command of the U.N. force on
Sept. 25. The appointment lasts for two years.
	   The 1,064-member force stationed in the Golan Heights is made of
troops from Austria, Canada, Japan, Poland and Slovakia.

	   After a daylong debate focused mainly on the issue of executive
pay, preliminary results showed 99.89 percent of the voted Daimler
shares were cast in favor of the deal.
	   Earlier Friday at the Chrysler shareholders meeting in Delaware,
preliminary results showed 97.5 percent of the voted Chrysler
shares were in favor.
	   Although they only needed 75 percent of the shareholders to
agree to the stock swap, both Daimler and Chrysler wanted at least
90 percent so they could use a more favorable accounting method.
	   If less than 75 percent participated, Daimler and Chrysler had
said they would have to cancel the whole deal because then it would
be considered a sale and face higher taxation.

Hamas supporters clash with Israeli troops; 32 injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For AMs, UPDATES with new Palestinian quote, 10th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets.
	   Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during the two-day
Jewish Near Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the
group's bomb makers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, the crowd stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement. Troops fired rubber
bullets, injuring 32 Palestinians, including one who was in serious
condition with a chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Ross held a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   After the meeting Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian
parliament, told The Associated Press ``Mr. Ross managed to bridge
the gaps on some issues.''
	   However a Palestinian cabinet minister said the progress was
negligible. ``The main issues we discussed were not resolved and we
did not achieve any progress,'' said Yasser Abd Rabbo.
	   Qureia added that the Palestinians may agree to delay their
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state next May 5 if their
negotiations with the Israelis are achieving progress.
	   If ``we agree with the Israelis that negotiations are going well
and there is a possibility of reaching an agreement, then the
declaration may be postponed for a month or two,'' he said.
	   It was the first time the Palestinians had agreed to such a
delay.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving for Washington on Saturday to brief U.S. President
Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.
	   Also Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate ordered a Jewish West Bank
settler held until Sunday, on suspicion he shot to death an
17-year-old Palestinian in the village of Beitunia on Thursday.
	   The settler, Avshalom Ladani from the Dolev settlement, had
turned himself in several hours after the shooting. Ladani had been
driving through Beitunia when the incident occurred.
	   Ladani's lawyer, Yair Golan, said his client acted in
self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, and that he shot
only in the air.
	   However, Palestinians said Ladani opened fire unprovoked,
seriously wounding two Palestinian teen-age boys who were walking
home from school. One of the injured, Iyad Kabasma, died of his
wounds at Ramallah Hospital on Thursday afternoon, while a second
boy remained in stable condition.
	   Kabasma was buried Friday afternoon in the village of Ein Arik
near Beitunia, and hundreds of mourners chanted ``long live the
rifle.'' A wall slogan in the village signed by Arafat's Fatah
movement read, ``Shame to those who support co-existence with the
occupiers.''

	   With the stakes so high, Daimler expected a record 16,000
shareholders present for the vote in a Stuttgart arena. Tents were

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane watches were posted
from St. Lucia to Anguilla in the eastern Caribbean as Hurricane
Georges, packing 105 mph (170 kph) winds, bore down on the small
islands.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) Friday, the National Hurricane Center
in Miami said Georges was located at 13.7 north latitude and 48.5
west longitude, about 825 miles (1,320 kilometers) west of the
Lesser Antilles. The hurricane's sustained winds were estimated at
105 mph (170 kph) with gusts up to 125 mph (200 kph).
	   ``Georges is currently a category 2 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and is forecast to strengthen into a
category 3 within the next 24 hours,'' said the statement from the
Hurricane Center.
	   The hurricane was moving west at 22 mph (35 kph) and was
expected to continue on the same course for the next 24 hours,
which would carry it toward the Windward Islands.
	   Hurricane watches were posted Friday in St. Lucia, Martinique,
Guadeloupe, Saba, Antigua, St. Maarten, Anguilla and other islands
as disaster preparedness teams met to plan for Georges, the fourth
hurricane of the Atlantic season and the first to threaten the
Caribbean islands.
	   In Martinique, which lies directly in the expected path of the
storm, residents calmly stocked up on water, candles and batteries
Friday.
	   The sound of hammers on nails rang out across St. Maarten, where
residents still vividly remember the devastating direct hit from
Hurricane Luis two years ago.
	   In Anguilla, government workers began storing important files in
safe places in offices, in case the hurricane hits over the weekend
when employees are not available to safeguard records.

Brazilian stocks cap see-saw week on the up slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stock markets ended up
Friday, capping a see-saw week where Brazilian stocks gained back
as much as 45 percent of their value before retreating slightly.
	   Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo's Bovespa, ended
Friday up 4.2 percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange
closed up 2.9 percent.
	   Traders warned, however, that it was too early to call it an
upward trend because of the low volume. Trading volume was a thin
dlrs 379 million (448 million reals).
	   ``Trading wasn't active at all so it's difficult to say if this
represents a recovery,'' said one Sao Paulo trader. ``We got a
boost at the end simply because the Dow (Jones Industrial Average)
improved, but there wasn't really any news affecting the market.''
	   Brazil's stock and currency markets have been battered in recent
weeks by the global financial crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets.
	   Brazil has lost some dlrs 25 billion in reserves in recent
weeks, but the country still has some dlrs 50 billion in foreign
reserves making a successful speculative attack on the currency
unlikely for the time being.
	   Stocks lost as much as three-quarters of their value from their
high in March before recovering somewhat. With Friday's gain, the
Bovespa has lost 38.43 percent for the year.
	   Investors were heartened earlier in the week by reports
Brazilian officials were discussing a possible aid package with the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Brazil's government and international bankers have since denied
that any concerted action was in the works.

	   Kopper didn't provide any figures, reiterating that the issue
will be settled by the board of the merged company.
	   DaimlerChrysler will present a stock option plan for the merged
company at the next shareholder meeting in May next year, Kopper
said.
	   Shareholders with union ties also worried about merger-related
layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no jobs will be
lost.
	   And there were concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. One watchdog concern is whether Schrempp
and Eaton will be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands
separate if, as planned, they share platforms and merge their
purchasing.
	   But Daimler pulled out all its cards to woo shareholders,
including the sports figures it has under contract.
	   The German automaker ran videos on large screen TVs at the
meeting with tennis ace Boris Becker and Formula One driver Mikka
Hakkinen hailing the deal.
	   ``The world has become their ball and they are playing it back
and forth across the ocean now,'' Becker says in the publicity
film, adding both companies have found the perfect doubles partner.
	   At the meeting's start, Schrempp also told shareholders that
their company is in better shape now than it has been for years.
	   Operating profit doubled in the first half of 1998 to 3.8
billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue projections for 1998
have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion) to 140
billion marks (dlrs 83 billion).
	   ``With DaimlerChrysler we intend to set a new standard in
earnings power, profitable growth and in helping shape the future
of our society,'' Schrempp assured shareholders. ``In doing so, we
will secure your company's independence and strengthen its
values.''
	   Schrempp, 54, made his reputation as a defender of shareholder
value by refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by
Mercedes-Benz cars _ after his predecessor Edzard Reuter ran up
record losses by expanding into a diversified conglomerate.

Immigrant who became national hero in Spain is now homeless and
</HEADLINE>
destitute

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Milud Jedari, an Algerian immigrant, lost
his left leg and right eye when he was thrown in front of a Madrid
subway train while trying to save a girl from a beating.
	   He became a national hero instantly, with officials tripping
over each other to give him civic awards and extend his visa. A
bank bought him a house. Job offers poured in.
	   Jedari stunned people by publicly forgiving the subway mugger
who'd pushed him onto the tracks. He hugged him at the man's trial.
	   That was in 1996. Now Jedari's an illegal alien on crutches,
living in a shelter and facing expulsion, the newspaper El Pais
reports.
	   Hard times came fast for Jedari, who is 26.
	   He went to live in the gift house, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) south of Madrid in the town of Toledo, with his parents and
two brothers. But with his physical disability and little knowledge
of Spanish, Jedari could not work.
	   He said people in Toledo were racist. Jedari got into a horrific
fight at a discotheque and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
	   He and his family returned to their village in Algeria, and
lived in a house with no electricity or running water. Jedari said
his stardom followed him there, with people nagging him for help to
get into Spain.
	   He returned, only to find his father had sold the house in order
to buy one in Algeria, and that his residence and work papers had
expired.
	   ``I went to renew them and they told me that first I needed to
have a job offer. But no one offers me work anymore,'' he told El
Pais. He lived with friends in Madrid, moving from one house to
another, then finally into a shelter.
	   The final straw came Thursday when he was waiting at a bus stop
outside the shelter and police asked to see his papers. He spent
six hours in jail before being released. El Pais quoted friends of
Jedari as saying officials may have begun deportation proceedings
against him.

United States to help Colombian farmers stop growing illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The United States announced a modest
donation Friday to help Colombia coax its farmers away from growing
coca and opium crops used to make cocaine and heroin.
	   The dlrs 500,000 check from the United States Agency for
International Development will help Colombia plan and implement
so-called ``alternative development'' programs favored by
environmentalists and President Andres Pastrana, the governments
said.
	   Colombia, which produces 80 percent of the cocaine and a growing
share of the heroin sold in the United States, pledged to match the
U.S. donation with its own funds.
	   The Colombian government receives about dlrs 100 million a year
in U.S. anti-narcotics aid, most it for aerial spraying of the
crops with deadly herbicides.
	   Pastrana, who took office in August, has said more emphasis
should go to helping the farmers switch to legal, albeit less
lucrative crops.
	   Such programs could up to dlrs 1 billion to succeed in Colombia,
the United Nations has estimated.
	   Illegal plantings have increased despite the aerial fumigation,
which environmentalists say threatens humans, plants and animals in
and around the Amazon River basin.

Bosnia may seek own solution if council fails to act, ambassador

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Bosnia's U.N. ambassador warned Friday
that his country may take matters into its own hands if the
Security Council fails to strengthen efforts to pursue three Serb
war crimes suspects in Yugoslavia.
	   ``I can tell you right now, people will not be in a position to
reconcile unless they feel that there is an effective methodology
for dealing with those responsible for war crimes,'' Muhamed
Sacirbey told reporters.
	   Sacirbey sent a letter dated Sept. 17 to the council president
asking for action to ensure that Yugoslav authorities cooperate in
bringing suspects to justice. The U.N. war crimes tribunal sent a
letter last week asking for such support.
	   The council has yet to take action on either letter. Sacirbey
said he has discussed the matter with council president Hans
Dahlgren of Sweden whose views on the matter were ``certainly
forthcoming.''
	   Sacirbey refused to say more about the conversation but said he
sensed ``that there is a desire on the part of some to say, `Well
let's deal with this ... after we dealt with Kosovo,''' the
Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians have been fighting Serbs
for independence since February.
	   ``If that's the case, we all might be waiting another two years
before this letter is dealt with. And that's if we're lucky,'' he
said.
	   For three years, Yugoslavia has been harboring three army
officers accused of planning and carrying out a 1991 massacre of
200 non-Serbs near the Croatian city of Vukovar, the tribunal said.
	   The three _ Mile Mrksic, Veselin Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic
_ are believed to be in Yugoslavia despite international arrest
warrants.
	   ``If the Security Council doesn't pursue remedies, then it may
need to be left up to my country to consider what remedies it will
pursue on its own,'' Sacirbey said.
	   Failure to arrest the suspects also threatens the fragile peace
in Bosnia, Sacirbey said.
	   He said his country made ``significant concessions'' for the
1995 Dayton peace accord, which halted the war in the former
Yugoslavia and envisioned a state where Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and
Croats could live in peace. The accord requires governments to hand
over war crimes suspects for trial.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim president in Bosnia, ``has stated
publicly that the Dayton peace agreement comes as a whole, not
piecemeal, not a la carte,'' Sacirbey said.

Daimler shareholders approve merger with Chrysler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; ADDS Schrempp quote, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHARINE SCHMIDT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz shareholders followed the
lead of Chrysler's in voting Friday overwhelmingly to merge the two
automakers into a new global giant.
	   After an emotional, marathon meeting focused mostly on the issue
of executive pay, preliminary results showed 99.89 percent of the
voted Daimler shares were cast in favor of the deal. The company
needed 75 percent voting yes for the deal to go through.
	   ``I was overwhelmed by the clear majority of the shareholder
vote,'' Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp said afterward. ``It feels
good.''
	   He added now the ``real work'' begins of making the merger a
reality.
	   Earlier Friday at the Chrysler shareholders meeting in Delaware,
preliminary results showed 97.5 percent of the voted Chrysler
shares were in favor.
	   With the stakes so high, Daimler expected a record 16,000
shareholders present for the vote in a Stuttgart arena. Tents were
set up outside to handle the overflow.
	   After 12 hours of debate, the vote finally came about 11 p.m.
(2100 gmt) _ an hour before the deadline. Still, some shareholders
will likely lodge a complaint against Daimler under German law
because they think Daimler didn't give them enough time to address
their questions.
	   Chief among shareholders' concerns was how the merged company
would handle the disparity in executive pay between Germany and the
United States. Some feared Daimler managers will use the merger to
raise their own salaries.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in total compensation, compared to about dlrs 2 million for
Daimler CEO Juergen Schrempp.
	   Schrempp evaded the issue under questioning from reporters
before the meeting opened.
	   ``The executive pay will be determined by the market,'' he said.
``I am waiting for the new management board to decide on that.''
	   Daimler supervisory board chairman Hilmar Kopper repeated that
stance during the meeting.
	   He also said the board members of the merged company
DaimlerChrysler won't be paid as much as Chrysler executives, but
didn't specify how this would affect current pay levels of Chrysler
executives. Because Eaton sits on the board, it could mean that
Daimler executives would like to see his pay reduced.
	   ``We don't want an Americanization of the German executive pay
system,'' Kopper said. ``There won't be an unlimited rise to U.S.
levels.''
	   DaimlerChrysler will present a stock option plan for the merged
company at the next shareholder meeting in May next year, Kopper
said.
	   Shareholders with union ties also worried about merger-related
layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no jobs will be
lost.
	   And there were concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. One watchdog concern is whether Schrempp
and Eaton will be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands
separate if, as planned, they share platforms and merge their

	   But Daimler pulled out all its cards to woo shareholders,

	   At the meeting's start, Schrempp also told shareholders that
their company is in better shape now than it has been for years.
	   Operating profit doubled in the first half of 1998 to 3.8
billion marks (dlrs 2.26 billion) and revenue projections for 1998
have been raised from 134 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion) to 140

	   Schrempp, 54, made his reputation as a defender of shareholder
value by refocusing Daimler on its core business _ led by
Mercedes-Benz cars _ after his predecessor Edzard Reuter ran up
record losses by expanding into a diversified conglomerate.
	   Market onlookers viewed Friday's vote as a done deal despite the
intense discussions at the Daimler meeting. But the real test still
lies ahead.
	   During the stock swap offer period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 23,
Daimler hopes that 90 percent of all shares will be swapped for
shares in the new DaimlerChrysler company. That will allow it to
take advantage of the profit friendly ``pooling of interests''
under U.S. accounting law.
	   Daimler is offering 1.005 shares for each share held to sweeten
the deal if the 90 percent hurdle is cleared. Otherwise,
shareholders will only get a one-for-one ratio.

Tyson faces tough fight from Nevada panel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Nearly broke and with his future in the ring at
stake, Mike Tyson will plead for his license before the same panel
that tossed him out of boxing.
	   The man who once terrorized the heavyweight ranks will seek
reinstatement Saturday from the Nevada commissioners who stripped
him of his license for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   Tyson's adviser says the former heavyweight champion may be
forced to fight outside the country if he doesn't get a license.
	   ``I have loads of offers and I've turned them all down so far,''
adviser Shelly Finkel said. ``I don't know what I'm going to do if
he isn't licensed, though. His financial situation is very bad and
he needs to fight.''
	   Tyson earned more than dlrs 100 million in the ring in the two
years before his last bout with Holyfield in 1997.
	   Approval means Tyson could fight again before the end of the
year. Rejection would mean another year on the sidelines _ at least
in Nevada and the states that honor its suspension _ and threaten a
career that was fading even before he snapped in the ring and bit
Holyfield in their title fight.
	   ``Mike Tyson will have to rise to the occasion during his
licensing because it's going to be a test of what kind of person he
is,'' said Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the Nevada Athletic
Commission. ``They call him Iron Mike, but we're going to have to
wait and see.''
	   Last year, in the wake of the aborted ending of the richest
fight in boxing history, the commission banned Tyson from the sport
and fined him dlrs 3 million.
	   This time, though, the decision is complicated by another
matter, and the timing couldn't be worse for Tyson. He is accused
of attacking two men after a car accident last month in a suburban
Washington. He faces criminal charges that threaten his Indiana
probation on a rape conviction.
	   ``The whole issue is his temper and self-control,'' Ghanem said.
``Everything that has happened since we revoked his license we have
to find out about.''
	   Tyson, who at the last moment pulled out of an ill-fated attempt
to get licensed in New Jersey in August, will personally plead his
case. He needs at least three votes from the five-member
commission, and the burden of proof is on him alone.
	   Tyson has been seeing a Denver psychotherapist who will speak on
his behalf.
	   The boxer tried to help his case Thursday by appearing at a
luncheon honoring Ghanem and Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and shaking the
hands of commission members.
	   ``I believe we'll have a fair chance at it,'' Finkel said. ``You
never know until it's over, but hopefully it will happen.''
	   If Tyson is turned down, he will have to wait until Sept. 19,
1999 to reapply. The revocation applies to Nevada alone, but other
states have so far abided by it and are likely to do so again.
	   Tyson is 32 and conceivably could fight in another country, but
he would risk future licensing.
	   Ghanem signaled this week that the commission would question
Tyson not only about the Holyfield bout but about last month's
altercation.
	   ``It's going to be a very, very tough hearing, I'm pretty sure,
only because of what has happened recently,'' Ghanem said. ``He'll
have to prove to the commission he has rehabilitated and he can
live by its rules and regulations.''
	   Complicating any decision is the unresolved status of the
charges the two men, ages 50 and 62, filed against Tyson in
Gaithersburg. Maryland. Tyson has denied he struck the men, and a
preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2.
	   If Tyson does not provide an adequate explanation, the
commission could vote to wait until the charges are resolved before
ruling. It cannot, however, license him with the condition that he
is not convicted of the charges.
	   ``It will be yes, no or come back when you can give us the
answers,'' said Kirk Hendrick, a deputy attorney general who
advises the commission.
	   Reinstatement could return Tyson to the ring before the end of
the year, though he first faces a court fight over his promotional
rights.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ At least two people were seriously
injured when two U.S. Customs Service planes collided off the west
coast of Puerto Rico Friday afternoon and one plunged into the sea,
officials said.
	   Two people were rescued from the water near Mona Island, which
lies in the channel between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic,
and were taken to the Mayaguez Regional Hospital, according to
Puerto Rico Police spokesman Ricardo Wallas.
	   ``One of the injured showed no vital signs,'' said Wallas.
	   Police said the collision occurred at 3:30 p.m. in stormy
weather. One plane tried to make a forced landing on the small
airstrip on uninhabited Mona Island, which is a nature preserve,
but crashed into the sea.
	   The other plane was able to return safely to Mayaguez on the
west coast of Puerto Rico and the people on board were not injured.
	   Identities of the people on the two planes were not immediately
available.

Summerhays leads first round with 6-under 64
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays birdied the last five holes
to complete a 6-under-par 64 and take a two-stroke lead in the dlrs
1.1 million Kroger Senior Classic on Friday.
	   ``Getting off to a good start is marvelous,'' Summerhays said.
``You can't win the tournament on the first day, but this way you
don't have to come back.''
	   Mike Hill, Graham Marsh and Jim Albus were at 66, and seven
players shot 67.
	   ``I didn't want to stop. I wanted to keep going,'' said
Summerhays, who made the turn at even par because of two bogeys,
then awoke with six birdies on the back nine.
	   ``It was just a so-so round until the last five holes,'' he
said. ``You birdie those and it becomes a spectacular round.''
	   Hill won the tournament in 1995. Playing in Summerhays' group
Friday, he birdied the last two holes to pull into contention.
	   ``We really had a lot of fun,'' Summerhays said. ``Mike got me
laughing. He kept me loose.''
	   Summerhays took the first-round lead with a 64 last week at
Indianapolis on the way to finishing second behind Hugh Baiocchi.
	   Baiocchi was among six players at 67 on the Grizzly Course at
the Golf Center at Kings Island, just north of Cincinnati.
	   Albus used a slightly different putting stroke to put himself in
position to challenge Summerhays, but said he'd keep it a secret
unless he produces a couple more rounds in the 60s.
	   ``If I start crowing after one day, and tomorrow I shoot 86,
I'll feel like a dumbbell,'' he said.
	   Nine players were at 68, four strokes off the lead. Defending
champion Jay Sigel was among a group of eight at 69.
	   No one in the Kroger Senior's eight-year history has shot a 70
and won.
	   Sigel won last year with a record 18-under-par 195. Even if raw
scores equal that this year, par scores will reflect a design
change that made a par-4 out of the par-5 No. 9, reducing par to
70.
	   ``The course is sort of benign,'' Summerhays said, not unkindly.
``The greens are receptive.''
	   Rain earlier this week and a light drizzle Friday morning
softened the greens and let players shoot for the pin.
	   ``Scores will be on the low side,'' Albus predicted. ``If it
stays like this, they'll get lower and lower.''

Rebels release three foreigners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels released three foreigners
on Friday, including a 63-year-old American geologist seized 19
months ago in a northern mining region.
	   American Donald Riedel, Felipe Sosa Diaz of Uruguay and Rodrigo
Enderica Alarcon of Ecuador were all released in different places
and their kidnappings were unrelated, said a government official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The month-old government of President Andres Pastrana is engaged
in exploratory peace talks with Colombia's rebels, but there was no
indication Friday's releases were connected to the peace efforts.
	   Riedel was turned over to Roman Catholic Church representatives
near Morales in the northern state of Bolivar. He was kidnapped in
the same area on Feb. 24, 1997 in the San Lucas mountains, a remote
gold-mining region.
	   The area, 380 kilometers (240 miles) north of Bogota, is
dominated by rebels of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, the
country's second largest guerrilla movement. The ELN rebels freed
him.
	   Neither Riedel's hometown nor the company that employed him
could immediately be determined. The official said Riedel's family
did not live in Colombia.
	   The anti-kidnapping czar, Ruben Dario Ramirez, said in an
interview with the Radionet network that it took Riedel three days
of travel by boat and on foot to arrive at the handover point.
	   It was not known whether a ransom was paid for Riedel's release.
	   Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate and foreigners
are prize catches for guerrillas who depend on abductions as a
prime revenue source. Ransoms of dlrs 1 million for foreigners are
not unusual.
	   Sosa Diaz, 69, was released by rebels of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials as FARC, in Meta
state, not far from Bogota, and returned on his own to his home in
a suburb of the capital.
	   The government source said it appeared the FARC, the country's
main rebel group, erred in kidnapping Sosa several days ago,
indicating he is a man of humble means.
	   Scarce details were available on Enderica Alarcon, who was freed
by the FARC in Yarumal in the northwestern state of Antioquia, the
same town where he was kidnapped July 15.

Toyota inaugurates new plant in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Japanese auto maker Toyota on Friday
inaugurated its new dlrs 150 million plant in Brazil with a
capacity to turn out 15,000 cars a year.
	   The factory, located in the city of Indaiatuba, 65 miles (100
kilometers) northwest of the city of Sao Paulo, began producing
Corollas last month and will start distributing them to dealers
next week.
	   Present at the inauguration was Toyota's chairman, Shoichiro
Toyoda who said the company was also planning to manufacture other
models ``because we are sure of Mercosur's potential.'' Mercosur is
the customs union formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay.
	   He said Toyota's goal was to achieve a 10 percent market share
in Mercosur, ``today, one of the most promising markets in the
world.''
	   Toyota has been producing a Jeep-like vehicle called the
Bandeirante since 1959 at its plant in Sao Paulo's industrial
suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo.
	   The only other Japanese auto manufacturer in Brazil is Honda,
which inaugurated its plant in October 1997 in the city of Sumare
95 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   Honda has the capacity to produce 15,000 Civics a year.

Cullen scores winner upon return from 18 month fight with cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) _ Eighteen months after he was diagnosed
with cancer, John Cullen picked up where he left off, scoring the
game winning goal in Tampa Bay's 3-1 pre-season win over the
Buffalo Sabres on Friday.
	   It was an emotional return for the 34-year-old forward, who had
not played a game since March 28, 1997 when he scored against the
Hartford Whalers.
	   The next day, he learned he had non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
	   On Friday his recovery from the disease, the gruelling
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, the bone marrow transplant
and a brush with death when his heart stopped, came rushing back.
	   ``When I got back to the bench and they announced my name as the
goal scorer, I thought about all I'd been through over the past
year and a half,'' said Cullen. ``I sat there in disbelief. So many
other people like me don't get that second chance.''
	   Six months ago, Cullen received the news he was ``cancer-free,''
though he'll have to undergo regular testing to make sure the
disease stays in remission.
	   In the meantime, Cullen is basking in the afterglow of his
triumphant return.
	   ``It was good to play a game again if it was just training
camp,'' said Cullen. ``But I was so nervous I couldn't sleep a wink
last night.
	   ``This is just training camp but it felt like the Stanley Cup
final.''
	   At the time of his departure, Cullen was Tampa Bay's third
leading scorer, with 55 points and 18 goals.
	   But when doctors discovers a grapefruit-sized tumor in his
chest, his NHL career suddenly seemed unimportant.
	   After six gruelling months of intensive chemotherapy and
radiation treatment, traces of the cancer still remained, and
doctors were forced to take a more aggressive approach.
	   In October Cullen underwent a painful procedure in which bone
marrow was drilled out of his lower back, ``purged'' or cleansed,
then reintroduced into his body.
	   Four days later his heart stopped beating for almost a minute
before doctors were able to resucitate him.
	   But the treatment proved effective.
	   Cullen is now looking to regain his old position on the team,
joining the ranks of the Lightning's newest acquisitions, including
the first overall pick in the 1998 entry draft Vincent Lecavalier,
ex-Maple Leaf captain Wendel Clark, and former Washington Capitals
netminder Bill Ranford.
	   It was Jassen Cullimore, newly acquired from the Montreal
Canadiens, who got the first puck past the NHL's Most Valuable
Player, Sabres netminder Dominik Hasek, to open the scoring for
Tampa Bay.
	   Two minutes into the second, Cullen scored what proved to be the
game winner, before Brent Peterson slammed in the insurance marker
four minutes later.
	   The Sabres' only goal came from Michal Grosek with just 1:45
remaining in the period, with neither team able to find the back of
the net in the third.
	   ``It was very exciting to be part of the team again,'' said
Cullen, who now receives _ and answers _ numerous requests to visit
cancer patients. ``The whole team was pulling for me.
	   ``But there's still a long way to go.''

FDA approves new AIDS treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ AIDS patients got an easier-to-swallow drug
Friday as the Food and Drug Administration approved a new
once-a-day medicine that offers the first good alternative for
patients who cannot take today's best AIDS treatment.
	   DuPont Pharmaceuticals' Sustiva appears to be about as effective
as protease inhibitors, the landmark medicines that have helped
thousands of HIV patients rebound from their disease, the FDA said.
And because it's taken only once daily, Sustiva could significantly
cut the number of pills AIDS patients now swallow.
	   ``It really gives some flexibility and some new options for
patients,'' said Dr. Heidi Jolson, FDA's antiviral chief.
	   But the FDA warned that patients shouldn't race to switch to
Sustiva if they're doing well on other AIDS medications.
	   The HIV virus relentlessly mutates to overcome drug treatment,
meaning patients must take a drug until it quits working _ not
switching on the spur of the moment _ so they don't exhaust their
options too quickly, stressed AIDS expert Dr. Anthony Fauci of the
National Institutes of Health.
	   But for newly diagnosed patients, or those whose current
cocktail of AIDS medicines is failing or causing too many side
effects, Sustiva offers a good option, he said.
	   In a six-month study of 450 patients taking the standard drugs
AZT and 3TC plus either Sustiva or the most popular protease
inhibitor, Crixivan, both therapies were equally effective.
	   The FDA approved Sustiva, known chemically as efavirenz, for
both adults and children. It is to be taken with a protease
inhibitor and/or older AIDS medicines.
	   The Sustiva portion of that cocktail will cost almost dlrs 4,000
a year. DuPont says the price is midrange for AIDS drugs, and that
Sustiva therapy could save up to dlrs 500 a year over Crixivan
cocktails. DuPont also promised a treatment assistance program for
poor patients, but would not reveal details.
	   But some AIDS activists attacked the price; the group Act Up
wrote DuPont this week threatening protests to ``reveal your
greed.''
	   Sustiva ``addresses some important issues in the lives of people
with HIV, including the complexity of taking a large number of
drugs,'' said Daniel Zingale of AIDS Action. ``But I don't think
the company went far enough in fair pricing. ... They could price
this lower and still make a profit.''
	   Typical HIV patients swallow some 20 pills throughout the day to
combat the virus, timed carefully to take some with meals and some
without. They may also take additional medicines to prevent
HIV-caused infections. Missing even a few antiviral pills, however,
allows the HIV to mutate and become more difficult to treat.
	   Sustiva is taken just once a day, in three capsules, whenever
it's convenient. DuPont also is developing a formulation that will
require only a single tablet a day.
	   Easing patients' ``pill burden'' may be Sustiva's main advance.
With it, some patients may get by on just five pills a day.
	   ``I have some patients who absolutely will only take medicine
twice a day,'' said Dr. Donald Poretz of Virginia's Inova Fairfax
Hospital. ``This is a nice addition.''
	   Half of Sustiva patients suffer dizziness, insomnia, impaired
concentration, abnormal dreams and drowsiness. Therefore, patients
should consider taking Sustiva at bedtime, the FDA said, and
definitely avoid driving or operating machinery if they suffer the
side effects.
	   These are milder side effects than many AIDS drugs cause, and
unlike other drugs they usually disappear over time, the FDA said.
	   But FDA's Jolson cautioned that Sustiva can also cause some
severe side effects, and that it has been studied for only six
months. Longer use of AIDS drugs typically turns up more problems.
Sustiva's cautions include:
	   _Some patients _ usually those with a history of substance abuse
or mental illness _ suffer severe depression or delusions. They
should stop taking the drug.
	   _Forty percent of children and some adults suffer skin rashes,
occasionally severe.
	   _Women must use effective contraception because animal studies
suggest Sustiva causes severe birth defects. The FDA ordered DuPont
to track accidental pregnancies to determine the true risk.
	   In a separate development Friday, Merck and Co. stopped a study
it had hoped would pave the way for easier Crixivan use. But taking
Crixivan twice a day instead of the government-approved three daily
doses proved far less effective.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ One U.S. Customs Service pilot was
killed and another was rescued in the ocean off Puerto Rico after a
mid-air collision with another Customs Service plane, federal and
local officials said Friday.
	   The two planes were among a group of eight Customs Service
planes being flown from Puerto Rico to Curacao as part of an
evacuation plan in advance of Hurricane Georges, the Customs
Service said in a statement released from its Washington
headquarters.
	   The two planes, each carrying a pilot and co-pilot, collided one
hour after taking off from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Both planes
attempted to return to Puerto Rico but one of the damaged craft
crashed into the ocean one mile off the coast of uninhabited Mona
Island, Puerto Rico. The other damaged plane landed safely.
	   Lt. Saul Zapata of the Ranger Corps responsible for Mona Island,
a Puerto Rico nature preserve, said foul weather contributed to the
accident.
	   U.S. Navy and Coast Guard rescue teams assisted in recovery
efforts and the surviving crewman's injuries were described as
minor. Dr. David Villareal of the Mayaguez Medical Center said the
injured crewman was in stable condition.
	   The names of both men in the downed craft were being withheld
pending notification of relatives.
	   Officials said the other six planes proceeded on to Curacao.
	   Customs Service Director Raymond W. Kelly said that the accident
would be investigated initially by the National Transportation and
Safety Board with a followup internal Customs investigation.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ In a Sept. 5 story about the
Swissair crash off Nova Scotia, The Associated Press erroneously
reported that TWA took days to compile a passenger list when TWA
Flight 800 exploded in 1996.
	   In fact, TWA provided The AP with a passenger list about 24
hours after the jumbo jet exploded off New York's Long Island.
	   Relatives of TWA victims had complained about getting too little
information in the first hours after the crash and New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was also critical of TWA's communication with
officials.
	   The story also erroneously stated that TWA officials had said
their first priority was to investigate the possibility that a
terrorist attack downed the plane. At the time of the Flight 800
disaster, TWA officials said their first task was to notify
victims' families and assist them.
	   The story also said TWA did not offer expense money for family
members who traveled to New York to be near the accident site.
	   TWA paid for hotel rooms, airfares, funerals and other expenses,
but unlike Swissair, made no lump-sum payments for families to take
care of immediate needs. Swissair offered the family of each victim
dlrs 20,000.

Reds down Cubs 6-4; no homers for Sosa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's early game; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa's three-day weekend party got off to a
slow start.
	   Sosa, returning to Wrigley for the last homestand of the year,
didn't homer Friday. He didn't even get a hit, going 0-for-4 as the
Chicago Cubs lost 6-4 to the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Sosa remained tied with Mark McGwire for the home run record at
63 and the Cubs were in danger of losing their lead in the NL
wild-card race. Chicago began the day one game ahead of the New
York Mets, who played Florida on Friday night.
	   Blame Dmitri Young and Barry Larkin for spoiling the party. Each
drove in two runs and got four hits, and Young made a diving catch
that kept the Cubs from tying the game in the sixth inning.
	   Steve Parris (6-4) gave up four runs and five hits in five
innings. Gabe White retired the last 10 batters for his seventh
save, striking out pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill with two outs in the
ninth and Sosa on deck.
	   The faltering Cubs' pitching staff cost Chicago another game,
giving up six runs and 12 hits. Don Wengert (1-5) gave up one run
and two hits in two innings, including Larkin's go-ahead homer in
the sixth.

Cullen scores winner upon return from 18-month fight with cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) _ Eighteen months after being diagnosed
with cancer, John Cullen began his comeback by scoring the
game-deciding goal in Tampa Bay's 3-1 exhibition victory over the
Buffalo Sabres on Friday.
	   It was an emotional return for the 34-year-old forward, who had
not played a game since March 28, 1997 when he scored against the
Hartford Whalers.
	   The next day, he learned he had non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
	   On Friday, his recovery from the disease, the grueling
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, the bone marrow transplant
and a brush with death when his heart stopped, came rushing back.
	   ``When I got back to the bench and they announced my name as the
goal scorer, I thought about all I'd been through over the past
year and a half,'' Cullen said. ``I sat there in disbelief. So many
other people like me don't get that second chance.''
	   Six months ago, Cullen received the news he was ``cancer-free,''
although he'll have to undergo regular tests to make sure the
disease stays in remission.
	   In the meantime, Cullen is basking in the afterglow of his
triumphant return.
	   ``It was good to play a game again if it was just training
camp,'' Cullen said. ``But I was so nervous I couldn't sleep a wink
last night.
	   ``This is just training camp but it felt like the Stanley Cup
final.''
	   At the time of his departure, Cullen was Tampa Bay's No. 3
scorer with 55 points and 18 goals.
	   When doctors discovered a grapefruit-sized tumor in his chest,
his NHL career suddenly seemed unimportant.
	   After six months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, traces
of the cancer still remained, and doctors were forced to take a
more aggressive approach.
	   In October, Cullen underwent a painful procedure in which bone
marrow was drilled out of his lower back, ``purged'' or cleansed,
then reintroduced into his body.
	   Four days later, his heart stopped for almost a minute before
doctors were able to resucitate him.
	   But the treatment proved effective.
	   Cullen is now looking to regain his old position on the team,
joining the ranks of the Lightning's newest acquisitions, including
the first overall pick in the 1998 entry draft, Vincent Lecavalier,
ex-Maple Leaf captain Wendel Clark and former Washington Capitals
goalie Bill Ranford.
	   It was Jassen Cullimore, newly acquired from the Montreal
Canadiens, who got the first puck past the NHL's Most Valuable
Player, Sabres netminder Dominik Hasek, to open the scoring for
Tampa Bay.
	   Two minutes into the second, Cullen scored what proved to be the
winner, before Brent Peterson slammed in the insurance goal four
minutes later.
	   The Sabres' only goal came from Michal Grosek with just 1:45
remaining in the period, with neither team able to find the back of
the net in the third.

Autumn in Ohio is also great time for golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Some said it was insanity to put a women's
golf tournament up against football in the Buckeye state.
	   So far, however, it looks like a stroke of genius.
	   Ohio State is ranked No. 1 in America and three other state
colleges are defending national champions, plus there is the
enormous draw of high school games on Friday and Saturday.
	   Yet this week's Solheim Cup is drawing huge crowds to Muirfield
Village Golf Club _ just a few kilometers from Ohio Stadium, where
Ohio State plays host to No. 21 Missouri Saturday.
	   ``We've sold around 20,000 week-long badges going into today,''
tournament director Jim Wisler said Friday. ``And that's before you
count walkup, sponsors and other sales.''
	   Bob Cantin, a spokesman for the competition's title sponsor,
said he is shocked by how much the event has grown in popularity
over its eight years.
	   ``There's at least a tenfold increase,'' he said.
	   Muirfield Village doesn't release attendance figures, either for
the Solheim Cup, the annual Memorial Tournament, or the Ryder Cup
it played host to in 1987. But LPGA officials estimated the crowd
for the opening ceremonies after Thursday's practice rounds at
11,000. And for Friday's foursomes and fourball matches, galleries
lined the ropes on every hole of the competition.
	   ``Compared to a normal PGA event, I'd say it's a good crowd,''
Wisler said. ``We've exceeded the LPGA's and the Solheim family's
expectations.''
	   Wisler said that advance ticket sales for the 1994 Solheim held
at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., was $12,000. He
said advance ticket sales for this year's Solheim was around
$600,000.
	   Team USA member Rosie Jones said there were more people in the
gallery for Thursday's practice round than watched the final-day
singles matches in the inaugural Solheim in 1990 at Orlando, Fla.
	   Cantin said Europe's 1992 victory over the United States heated
the rivalry.
	   ``It's definitely bigger this year and getting bigger every time
it's played,'' said John Solheim, son of tournament founder Karsten
Solheim.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; INTERESTED GALLERY: &LR;  United States member Tammie Green is six
months pregnant and is being followed around the course by her
obstetrician.
	   But that's not hardly the only person interested in the native
of Somerset, Ohio, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away from the
course.
	   After she finished Thursday's practice round, Green was met at
the 18th green by her aunt. Her aunt happens to be a nun, Sister
Concetta Green, 84, who lives at Ohio Dominican College in Columbus
and is retired after a 48-year teaching career.
	   ``I can always use that divine intervention,'' Tammie Green
said.
	   Sister Green presented mother-to-be Green with a doll and bib
for her baby, which is due in December, along with a string of
cardboard cutout figures signed by many of the 150 nuns who also
live at Ohio Dominican.
	   ``All of them are singing rosaries and praying for you,'' Sister
Green said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SOLHEIM CLIPS: &LR;  Muirfield Village founder and course designer
Jack Nicklaus began his speech during the opening ceremonies by
gazing at the sky and saying, ``What is that up there?'' The sun
was shining _ a rare occurrence for the Memorial Tournament, which
Nicklaus hosts. ... There are 750 volunteers working at the
tournament. ... Dottie Pepper has opened with a foursomes victory
the last three Solheims _ each time paired with Brandie Burton. ...
Solheim rookie Catriona Matthew picked up a point for her side in
her first match. Then again, her foursomes partner was the No.
1-ranked player in the world, Sweden's Annika Sorenstam. ``We just
kind of never looked as though we were going to lose and we
didn't,'' said the 29-year-old Scot.

Vote results may shatter Western plans for Bosnia

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 11-14 to ADD details on indicted war crimes
suspects Karadzic and Mladic. &QL; 
 &UR; With Bosnia &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Strenuous and costly Western efforts
to patch up war-torn Bosnia could be wiped out if Serb hard-liners
are declared the big winners of last weekend's elections.
	   Final results won't be known until next week, but initial
indications are that extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen has
defeated the U.S. favorite, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their war-time goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In one of the costliest operations since World War II, the West
has deployed 35,000 peacekeepers and invested billions of dollars a
year to help rebuild Bosnia, but efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and
Muslims together again have shown little result.
	   The West had hoped that the vote would cement Serb moderates in
power and sideline extreme nationalists influenced by war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, a former Bosnian Serb leader, and his
policies of ethnic divisions.
	   During the election campaign, Plavsic and her allies spoke about
the economy and plans to use Western money to raise living
standards. Poplasen and other hard-liners called the moderates
Western stooges who want to unify Serbs with rival Muslims and
Croats in a single state.
	   The United States has made no secret of its favorite. During her
visit to Bosnia last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the U.S. only would assist those who help implement the 1995
Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's 3 1/2-year war.
	   Such open support, however, could have backfired against Plavsic
and her ``Harmony'' coalition because Serbs have a history of
defiance against foreign influence.
	   Nationalist sentiment also may have been rekindled by clashes in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, where the largely Muslim ethnic
Albanian majority is seeking independence from Serb rule.
	   Rising Western pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and so far empty threats of a NATO military intervention
in Kosovo, also hurt the pro-Western Plavsic at the polls, they
said.
	   The reluctance of the heavily armed NATO force to arrest wartime
Serb leaders and indicted war criminals Karadzic and Ratko Mladic
has served to bolster the nationalists who claim that the
Westerners are cowards who will back down whenever confronted by a
united Serb populace.
	   The two men have remained at large ever since NATO troops were
deployed to Bosnia three years ago, despite repeated calls for
their arrest by the International War Crimes tribunal in The Hague.
	   They are protected by several dozen guards, and NATO commanders
have shied away from exposing their troops to possible loss of life
in the operation.

	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ The head of a family massacred near this
Baja California town was a small-time marijuana trafficker who may
have run afoul of more dangerous criminals, prosecutors said
Friday.
	   State Attorney General Marco Antonio de la Fuente told a news
conference that 10 people were in custody _ though not formally
arrested _ in connection with Thursday's massacre of 18 members of
Castro's extended family.
	   He said a search in the town of Tecate turned up guns similar to
those used in the shooting at Castro's ranch.
	   ``The evidence shows that Mr. Castro had problems with other
people over drugs,'' de la Fuente said. ``The motive appears to be
problems between two or three groups involved in drug
trafficking.''
	   Castro was in a coma Friday, guarded by police and soldiers.
Eight children and 10 adults, including a woman 8 months pregnant,
were killed after the gunmen pulled them from their beds, forced
them to lie face-down in a patio and opened fire.
	   De la Fuente said Castro apparently had been tortured before he
was shot. A trail of blood led from his body to a chair in the
house and there were signs he had been beaten.
	   Officials said the federal attorney general's office, which
oversees federal crimes such as drug and weapons violations, was
taking charge of the case.
	   Gen. Jose Luis Chavez, chief of the federal agency's office for
Baja California, confirmed that officials had been investigating
Castro.
	   ``We were preparing to ask for a search warrant'' of Castro's
house, ``but unfortunately events got ahead of us.''
	   The respected magazine Zeta of Tijuana, 60 miles (95 kilometers)
north of this beach resort, in June identified Fermin Castro as a
member of the Arellano Felix drug gang and said he was known as
``The Iceman.'' It cited a confidential report by the federal
attorney general's office.
	   De la Fuente said Castro ``had some contact and paid landing
rights'' to an Arellano Felix lieutenant, Ismael Higuera Guerrero.
	   ``But he was not within the formal structure'' of Higuera's
group, the attorney general said.
	   The issue of Zeta published Friday said the same documents
listed two other victims of the massacre as members of the same
gang.
	   Other than Castro, the only survivors were 12-year-old Mario
Alberto Flores _ who was in serious condition _ and Viviana Flores,
15, who apparently escaped before the shooting.
	   Relatives waited in the parking lot of the hospital on Friday
wearing cowboy hats and leaning on their pickup trucks. They denied
Castro had drug ties and said he had no known enemies.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   They described Castro as a man who liked betting and made
frequent trips to Arizona, Nevada and other states to see farm
animals and ranches.
	   Several years ago, Castro began building a gated, three-house
compound with satellite antennas, that dwarfed surrounding houses.
	   Zeta said government documents indicated Castro had small
drug-smuggling airplanes that landed on airstrips in the desert
east of Ensenada.
	   The magazine also said Castro's sister Sandra and her husband,
Francisco Flores Altamirano, were involved in drug smuggling.
Altamirano would carry the drugs and his wife would drive ahead to
advise of police checkpoints, Zeta said. Both died in the massacre.
	   In an interview on the Televisa television network, Zeta
Publisher Jesus Blancornelas would not speculate as to whether the
massacre might have been carried out by the Arellano Felix gang or
by one of its rivals. But he did say the attack wasn't a typical
drug hit.
	   ``There's an unspoken rule among drug smugglers that children
are untouchable,'' he said.

Red-hot Pepper gets U.S. off to fast start in Solheim

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Dottie Pepper hit Team USA's first shot and
was the emotional leader the rest of the day, scoring two points as
the Americans took a 5 1/2-2 1/2 lead over Team Europe after
Friday's opening rounds of the Solheim Cup.
	   The United States, seeking its third straight team title, took
three of four points in the morning foursome, or alternate-shot,
matches, then came back to win 2 1/2 of a possible four points in
the afternoon fourball, or best-ball, matches.
	   Pepper was the lynchpin, energized by the flag-waving crowd and
continually hitting the big shots needed not just to win holes but
to prevent the opposition from winning them. Three times during the
afternoon match, she saved par and halved holes with long putts.
	   Pepper, who has played in all five Solheims, teamed with Juli
Inkster in the morning at Muirfield Village Golf Club, then was
paired with a soggy Brandie Burton in the afternoon.
	   Pepper's teams won 3-1 and 2-up, improving her record to 7-3-1
in Solheim foursomes and fourball matches. The two points also gave
her 10 1/2 in Solheim play _ the most of anyone on either side.
	   In the biggest rout of the day, Pat Hurst and Rosie Jones rolled
to a 7-5 victory over Europe's Lisa Hackney and Sophie Gustafson.
Hurst, who also picked up two points, and Jones, cheered by Ohio
State fans in the gallery, led 6-up through nine holes after
winning five of six holes during one span.
	   Betsy King and Chris Johnson went seven under but could only
halve their best-ball match against Laura Davies and Charlotta
Sorenstam.
	   France's Marie Laure de Lorenzi, playing with Helen Alfredsson,
salvaged a point for Europe when she holed a sand shot from behind
the 17th hole for a 2-1 victory over Kelly Robbins and Sherri
Steinhauer.
	   ``It hasn't gone really according to our plans today,'' European
captain Pia Nilsson said. ``The Americans played really, really
well. But I think we're OK, because we're not far away from playing
great. There are still 20 more points to go, so we have a lot
left.''
	   Pepper's playing partner in the best-ball competition was
Burton, who struggled with her game throughout the day but found
her way to a prime spot on most of the nightly sports highlight
shows.
	   Burton had to stand in the slippery, marshy area around the
creek which snakes across the par-5 11th hole as she hit her third
shot from almost eye level on the steep bank. She slipped as she
swung, hitting the ball into the creek, then lost her balance and
fell backwards. She tried to jump across the creek, but fell on the
far bank, losing her shoe in the muck. Her shorts and shoes were
covered with mud.
	   In the morning matches, Inkster nearly aced the 16th hole and
Pepper followed by hitting the birdie putt that all but assured the
Americans' first point.
	   After Davies and Trish Johnson conceded the 17th hole and the
match, the large partisan crowd circling the green shouted,
``USA!'' Inkster smiled and raised her fist to the gallery while
Pepper tipped her visor and waved.
	   ``You hope to get on the board first like we did,'' Pepper said.
``The team wants to know what's happening in front of them.''
	   Each match is worth a point in the Solheim, the women's
equivalent of the men's Ryder Cup. The United States needs 14 of
the 28 possible points to retain the cup; Team Europe needs 14 1/2
points.
	   Saturday's matches will also feature alternate-shot twosomes in
the morning and best ball in the afternoon. On Sunday, all 12
singles will play in head-to-head matches.

Canadian Dave Barr storms to second-round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN KEKIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENDICOTT, New York (AP) _ Dave Barr no longer has perfect
balance because of a bad back. On Friday, the 46-year-old Canadian
was perfectly wonderful from tee to green and gained the
second-round lead in the B.C. Open.
	   Barr, who has won just twice on the PGA Tour _ the 1981 Quad
Cities Open and 1987 Atlanta Classic _ shot a 7-under-par 65 for a
two-round total of 9-under 135. That was one shot better than
first-round leader Chris DiMarco, who had a 70. Chris Perry also
shot a 70 and was another stroke back in third.
	   Early-morning fog delayed play 90 minutes before evaporating
into a cloudless mid-September day more like Palm Springs,
California than upstate New York. The late start forced tournament
officials to suspend play at dusk with 22 players still on the
course. They will finish their rounds beginning at 7:30 a.m.
Saturday.
	   Barr has been struggling to recover from back surgery that cut
short his 1997 season and has left him with balance problems on
uphill lies because he can't transfer his weight quickly enough
into the slope.
	   ``I would have thought I would be a little bit farther along
coming back than I have been,'' said Barr, who has won just dlrs
23,000 in 18 tournaments this year. ``But when I talk to people,
they say it's going to be up to two years before I get fully
recovered.''
	   On Friday, the recovery seemed complete, especially on the
greens where Barr needed just 26 putts.
	   ``It was a real satisfying round,'' said Barr, who used a sand
wedge to set up four of his seven birdies on the bogey-free round.
``Today was just kind of play one hole at a time and not get too
far ahead of yourself. Hopefully, we can sneak something out.''
	   If Barr came out of nowhere, so, too, did 46-year-old R.W. Eaks,
who also shot a 65, aching back and all, and was in an eight-way
tie at 138. For the man they call ``Gramps'' on the Nike tour, it
was as refreshing as most of his weekends have been lately _ he had
missed nine straight cuts.
	   ``It seemed like kind of a walk in the park for a while, and
I've been walking in the park a lot on weekends,'' said Eaks, who
had eight birdies and one bogey on the day. ``This is the first
weekend I'm going to be around in 11 tournaments. I have been
walking a lot in the parks.''
	   Jim McGovern also moved into contention with a 65. McGovern, who
opened with a 3-over 75 on Thursday, birdied three of his first
four holes, then nailed an eagle-2 on the par-4 No. 9 and finished
at 140.
	   For Fred Funk, the round was both satisfying and frustrating. He
smiled at the solid 67 he shot and frowned at what could have been.
	   After waiting for the fog to burn off, Funk had three birdies
and a hole-in-one on the first five holes. But he only managed one
more birdie the remainder of the round.
	   ``I did shoot 5-under, but I was 5-under after five holes and I
really do feel like a let a really low one go because I was so far
under so quick,'' said Funk, who got his first ace on the PGA Tour
with a 9-iron from about 135 yards (123 meters). ``And then I just
shot even par coming in.
	   ``But I'm still in really good position,'' said Funk, who won
the rain-shortened 1996 B.C. Open in a playoff with Pete Jordan.
``I did what I wanted to do. I would have taken 67 before I teed
off, but with the weather and the conditions I really felt like I
should have shot lower.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks edged higher Friday as the market
steadied after Thursday's big slide, shaking off worries that not
enough is being done to prevent the economic crises abroad from
worsening. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.89 points _ or
by 0.3 percent _ to 7,895.66 after meandering from an early
56-point gain to a 45-point loss. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Japanese stock market's major index finished
up 0.9 percent, bouncing back from its lowest finish since March 5,
1986. Tokyo stocks were bolstered by expectations Japan's ruling
and opposition parties would reach a compromise on banking reform
in time for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United
States next week. After the Tokyo market closed, an agreement was
announced between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the main
opposition parties. In Europe, the main index in London closed down
1.5 percent, as did shares at Frankfurt, Germany. In Paris, where
stocks swooned 5.5 percent Thursday, the main index fell an
additional 1.7 percent. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   WILMINGTON, Delaware (AP) _ Chrysler Corp. shareholders Friday
strongly endorsed formation of a new international automaker by
merging with Daimler-Benz AG of Germany. Following their lead,
Daimler-Benz shareholders, meeting well into the night in
Stuttgart, Germany, also overwhelmingly approved the combination.
Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton told the 150 shareholders
gathered at a special meeting that the new DaimlerChrysler AG
``stands a very good chance of becoming the No. 1 transportation
company in the world.'' (US-DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank announced plans Friday to start
printing money to prevent the economy from spinning out of control,
despite warnings the move could mean a return to Soviet-style
restrictions. The government wants to fill the economy with enough
money to ensure the nation's debt-ridden banking system does not
fail, and to pay off many months' backlog of wages to state workers
and pensioners. But the debts are huge, and economists warned that
pumping that much money into the economy could lead to
hyperinflation. To prevent that, they said, the government would
have to introduce price controls, establish an artificial exchange
rate and impose tight controls over export revenues.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Negotiations between the European Union
and South Africa aimed at clinching a sweeping free-trade deal
broke up without agreement Friday as the two sides wrangled over
wine and food exports. ``The position has been a very hardline one
from their side,'' said Elias Links, South Africa's ambassador to
the EU and chief negotiator. ``What we want is for the European
Commission to come back with an agricultural offer improved.''
Links blamed the collapse of the 21st negotiating round between the
two sides on the EU's insistence that South Africa stop labeling
its fortified wines as sherry or port. The EU says only Spain can
produce wines called sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city
of Oporto can be labeled as port. South Africa claims they have
used those terms for 300 years. (EU-SOUTH AFFIRCA TRADE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways have yet to
get their controversial planned alliance off the ground, but they
could be on the verge of announcing an even wider global
arrangement, reports indicated Friday. American chief executive Don
Carty and British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling called a news
conference Monday to discuss a ``major worldwide airline
initiative.'' Published reports have indicated partners from
Canada, Australia and Hong Kong could be part of the plan.
(BRITAIN-AIRLINES)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a
gloomy assessment of the oil business on Friday _ sending its
shares tumbling despite its plans to weather the weak market by
closing four big European offices. Royal Dutch-Shell chairman Mark
Moody-Stuart warned shareholders that ``the results in the current
and next quarter are expected to reflect as difficult a trading
environment as we have seen in the last five years.'' Investors
pushed Shell shares down by 5.6 percent in heavy volume on the
London Stock Exchange, while Royal Dutch stock fell 6.1 percent in
Amsterdam. Royal Dutch-Shell predicted depressed oil prices won't
recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the ripple
effects of the Asian economic crisis are spreading into other
regions. (BRITAIN-SHELL OIL OUTLOOK)

rate and impose tight controls over export revenues. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said the government might have to revert to
command methods to restore economic stability. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House Judiciary Committee voted Friday to
release the videotape of President Bill Clinton's grand jury
testimony and 2,800 pages of material, including Monica Lewinsky's
explicit descriptions of their sexual relationship. After long
hours of partisan wrangling over two days, Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde said the committee agreed to release the material after
deleting 120 portions deemed sensitive or offensive. House
officials served notice that everything covered by the committee
vote would be released Monday morning. The material includes the
videotape and transcript of Clinton's four-hour testimony, a
transcript of Ms. Lewinsky's account about sexually explicit
telephone conversations with the president and a sex act in which
they used a prop. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ With an ultra-nationalist
reportedly leading the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency Friday,
a U.S. official linked continued aid to respect for democracy and a
commitment to peace in Bosnia. Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy for
the Balkans, arrived here following reports that ultra-nationalist
Nikola Poplasen was leading the U.S. favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in
incomplete returns from the Sept. 12-13 election. A Plavsic defeat
would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led efforts to boost the
popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs and sideline the
extremist supporters of indicted war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic, including Poplasen. It would also call into question the
entire U.S.-European strategy, which has been to funnel millions of
dollars in aid to those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian
state. (BOSNIA)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian parliament voted
overwhelmingly Friday to lift the immunity of former President Sali
Berisha, clearing the way for his arrest on charges he tried to
overthrow the government. It was unclear, however, whether the
government would soon attempt to serve an arrest warrant, a move
which could trigger more violent unrest from Berisha's radical
supporters. ``I'll continue the battle from whatever cell they put
me in,'' Berisha told reporters after the parliament action. ``I
have decided to resist. I have decided not to negotiate.''
International officials have urged President Fatos Nano to move
slowly against Berisha and allow a ``cooling off'' period after two
days of rioting, which brought Albania to the brink of anarchy for
the second time in 18 months. (ALBANIA)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas supporters clashed with
Israeli soldiers Friday after a West Bank memorial rally for the
group's top two fugitives, and 32 Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets. Israel, meanwhile, resealed its borders with the
West Bank and Gaza Strip amid warnings that Hamas would try to
kidnap Israeli soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli towns during
the two-day Jewish New Year holiday which starts at sundown Sunday.
Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout. In a
memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank hometown of El
Bireh, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted the group's bomb makers
to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

Hurricane watches posted in eastern Caribbean as Georges nears

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane watches were posted
from St. Lucia to Anguilla in the eastern Caribbean as Hurricane
Georges, packing 105 mph (170 kph) winds, bore down on the small
islands.
	   Residents were calm but were taking the strengthening storm
seriously.
	   ``I just pulled up two of my boats out of the water,'' said
David Armour on Dominica, the mountainous island that lies directly
in Georges' path. ``The gas stations are full. People are filling
their tanks.''
	   At 8 p.m. EDT Friday (0000 GMT Saturday), the National Hurricane
Center in Miami said Georges was located at 13.9 north latitude and
49.2 west longitude, about 790 miles (1,265 kilometers) west of the
Lesser Antilles. The hurricane's sustained winds were estimated at
105 mph (170 kph) with gusts up to 125 mph (200 kph).
	   ``Georges is currently a category 2 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and is forecast to strengthen into a
category 3 within the next 24 hours,'' said the statement from the
Hurricane Center.
	   The hurricane was moving west at 22 mph (35 kph) and was
expected to continue on the same course for the next 24 hours,
which would bring it to the eastern Caribbean islands Saturday
night and Sunday.
	   Hurricane watches were posted Friday in St. Lucia, Dominica,
Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saba, Antigua, St. Maarten, Anguilla and
other islands as disaster preparedness teams met to plan for
Georges, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season and the first
to threaten the Caribbean islands.
	   ``It looks like it's coming straight for us in Dominica,'' said
Armour, assistant director of the Anchorage Hotel. ``We're going to
start preparing the hotel tomorrow (Saturday) by boarding up the
windows and collecting food and water.''
	   A few miles further south in Martinique, residents calmly
stocked up on water, candles and batteries Friday. Meanwhile, the
sound of hammers on nails rang out across St. Maarten, where
residents still vividly remember the devastating direct hit from
Hurricane Luis three years ago.
	   In Anguilla, government workers began storing important files in
safe places in offices, in case the hurricane hits over the weekend
when employees are not available to safeguard records.

Iranian president faces crisis at home as he heads to U.N. meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami will be showing
Iran's new face to the world when he addresses the United Nations
on Monday, but back home his political reforms are sliding and his
hard-line opponents are talking of war.
	   Since he became president in August 1997, Khatami has changed
Iran's international image by easing his country's 20-year
confronation with the United States, and by encouraging freedom of
speech and political reforms.
	   Last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton acknowledged the changes
in Iran and called for a ``genuine reconciliation.''
	   When he addresses the annual General Assembly, the moderate
cleric is expected to promote his government's new image, one
seeking international dialogue and cooperation after two decades of
hostility with the United States and the West.
	   The last time an Iranian president spoke to the General Assembly
in 1986, the United States was still considered Tehran's No. 1
enemy by the ruling clerics. President Ali Khamenei used that
opportunity to blast ``The Great Satan,'' as the United States is
still called by hard-liners.
	   Despite his conciliatory attitude toward Washington, Khatami has
no plans to meet with Clinton or other U.S. officials. The
countries have no diplomatic relations.
	   However, Khatami will meet with wealthy Iranian-American
businessmen on Sunday in New York in a bid to attract foreign
investment to shore up the sluggish economy.
	   As Khatami heads for the United States to speak of peace,
hard-liners back home are preparing for a possible war with
Afghanistan. Iran is angered over the killing of eight diplomats
and a jounalist by the Taliban militia that rules nearly all of
Afghanistan.
	   Khamenei, now Iran's supreme leader and commander-in-chief of
its armed forces, placed the military on full alert on Tuesday amid
high tensions with the Taliban.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to
the border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Civil liberties encouraged by Khatami are also under attack by
hard-liners who prefer Iran's revolutionary international image to
the one that Khatami wants to promote.
	   After months of trying to silence an outspoken newspaper, Tous,
that began publishing after Khatami's May 1997 election, the
hard-liners ordered the Tehran daily shut down Wednesday and
arrested its editor and publisher.
	   Tous had angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The
newspaper had been calling for a diplomatic solution to Iran's
conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan, suggesting dialogue
instead of military strikes.
	   A senior editor and the publisher were jailed after being
charged with ``plotting against national security and the Islamic
Republic,'' a capital crime. But if convicted, they more likely
would face jail terms.
	   Earlier this month vigilantes suspected of acting on orders from
hard-line officials assaulted the minister of culture after he
failed to heed repeated warnings to muzzle outspoken newspapers.
	   ``The tensions with Afghanistan have given the hard-liners the
excuse to crack down on civil liberties,'' said Mohammad Mohsen
Sazgara, the managing director of Tous, who is flying home Saturday
from Malaysia to face arrest.
	   ``I'm afraid that the war-footing in the country will be used to
throttle all of Mr. Khatami's reforms,'' said Sazgara, who is not
sure what charges or punishment he faces.
	   In another setback to Khatami, a leading dissident was ordered
jailed by the hard-line judiciary for a second time, after being
released from 17 years in jail in 1996.
	   Abbas Amir-Entezam, a former deputy prime minister, was thrown
back in jail for speaking out against Assadollah Lajevardi, a
former head of Iranian prisons who was assassinated last month.
	   ``President Khatami has been unable to make any discernible
progress in fulfilling his campaign promises to institutionalize
the rule of law and to protect the rights of citizens,'' said Human
Rights Watch, an independent New York-based watchdog.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   We will send an advisory Sunday with the address of the ftp
server and a number to call Monday to get the username and
password. The username and password will NOT be available before
then.
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires in two
versions, a long and a short. We cannot estimate wordage until we
see the documents. The excerpts will be edited; much of the
sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any that remains will be
carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site and will be unedited and
will move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Clinton's testimony will also be available
at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.
	   AP's Hotline audio channel will carry the audio from the tapes
live, as they are released on Capitol Hill. This transmission will
be unanchored. In addition, AP Network News and AP's actualities
service will have sound bites from the tape throughout the day.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua on Friday protested
Honduras' seizure of a U.S. fishing boat in waters contested by the
two neighboring Central American countries.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Cesar Ubeda told reporters the boat
identified only as the Gulf King was boarded by the Honduran coast
guard Thursday morning and forced into a small Caribbean port.
	   The Gulf King had permission to fish in Nicarguan waters, Ubeda
said.
	   Nicaraguan army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said the crew of
the Gulf King was arrested a few hours after Honduran coast guard
craft harassed a Nicaraguan fishing vessel, the Caribbean, firing
about 20 rounds across its bow.
	   In a protest note, Nicaragua demanded that Honduras immediately
release the Gulf King and its eight-man crew.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A small plane crashed in a
residential neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital Friday,
killing its two occupants, a civil aviation authority said. No one
on the ground was hurt.
	   The twin-engine aircraft crashed shortly after take off from
Tobias Bolanos Airport, Hernan Luna, chief of operations at the air
terminal told reporters.
	   Luna said the plane dropped near a residence in the Rohmoser
neighborhood, but no one was hurt on the ground. He identified the
occupants killed as Alejandro Ruiz, the pilot, and Carlos Trejos,
grandson of former President Joaquin Trejos, who was in power from
1966 to 1970.
	   Luna did not say what type of plane it was. He said it belonged
to a company called Taxis Aereos and was on its way from San Jose
to Nicoya, 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the northwest.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar toured
the historic Inca capital of Cuzco on Friday, cutting short his
visit to Peru after Spain's Basque separatists declared a
cease-fire.
	   Aznar was scheduled to visit Cuzco, 350 miles (565 kilometers)
southeast of Lima high in the Andes mountains, on Saturday, which
was to be the last day of his four-day visit to Peru.
	   The Spanish leader will likely return to Madrid late Friday or
earlier Saturday, cutting short the visit by one day, a Peruvian
foreign ministry spokesman said.
	   Aznar will return Friday afternoon to Lima to visit a
thermoelectric plant and an oil refinery owned by Spanish
investors.
	   Fujimori and Aznar signed three agreements to strengthen
relations between the two countries, including an offer of
low-interest loans to Peru to help it recover from the El Nino
weather phenomenon and a commitment to cooperate in the fight
against drug-crop cultivation.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Employees of the Bolivian airline Lloyd
Aereo Boliviano shut down domestic and international flights Friday
leaving thousands of passengers stranded.
	   The strike seriously disrupted air traffic in Bolivia since the
only other airline operating in Bolivia, AeroSur, only has three
planes in service.
	   Workers called the 24-hour strike to demand payment of 56.6
million bolivianos (dlrs 11 million) that the Supreme Court ruled
was due to them for years of service. Two judges of the Supreme
Court are being tried by Congress for alleged acts of corruption
related to the ruling.
	   LAB, which is owned by the Brazilian airline VASP, says it will
not pay the judgment because according to a presidential decree,
any judgments that occurred after they purchased the airline three
years ago would be covered by the government.
	   The government, meanwhile, refuses to pay and says LAB is
responsible for paying workers.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ For years, Brazilians suffered
under high inflation. Today, they're worried about deflation.
	   Consumer prices in major cities fell 0.5 percent in August,
following a 0.3 percent drop in July, the government-run Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics said.
	   It was the first time prices had declined in consecutive months
since the institute began measuring inflation in 1979.
	   Eulina dos Santos, an analyst for the institute, said the
deflation was a result of high interest rates that forced retailers
to lower prices to attract customers.
	   Last week, Brazil's Central Bank raised its key lending rate to
nearly 50 percent a year in an effort to lure back investors who
were taking money out of the country.
	   The country has lost about dlrs 25 billion in reserves since
August, as investors worry about the health of the Brazilian
economy amid the turmoil that has hit Asian markets.
	   Runaway inflation was a problem until 1994, when a new economic
program called the Real Plan dropped inflation from around 50
percent a month in mid-1994 to less than 4 percent for the entire
year, the institute said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A plane crash in the west and a
helicopter accident in the south left four people dead and four
injured Friday, aviation officials said.
	   In the western Mato Grosso state three people were killed when
their single engine airplane near the state capital of Cuiaba, 980
miles (1,580 kms) northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
	   One of the planes passengers survived by jumping from the plane
before it exploded, an aviation official official said. Authorities
were still investigating the cause of the accident.
	   In the southern state of Parana, one man was killed and three
others injured when their helicopter crashed near some electricity
towers in Campo Mourao, 421 miles (680 kms) southwest of Rio.
	   The helicopter's passengers were working for the electricity
company Furnas and were searching for bombs placed near the
company's transmission towers.
	   Last Sunday, a bomb destroyed an electrical transmission tower.
Since then Federal Police have deactivated two more such bombs. So
far no one has taken credit for the sabotage.

U.S. envoy links aid to implementation of Dayton accord

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ With results from Bosnia's
election slowly leaking out, U.S. officials have begun laying the
groundwork for relations with hard-line leaders should they win.
	   U.S. officials in the region and in Washington stressed that
even if ultra-nationalist Nikola Poplasen defeats moderate
incumbent Biljana Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency, that
doesn't spell an end of a recent influx of aid.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy for the Balkans, arrived in Banja
Luka Friday following reports that Poplasen was leading Plavsic _
the U.S. favorite _ in incomplete returns from the Sept. 12-13
election.
	   While a Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for
U.S.-led efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian
Serbs and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, Gelbard stressed that U.S. support was
not linked to the person in power.
	   ``What we are interested in is, whoever is in power, that they
implement the Dayton agreement,'' he said after meeting Plavsic.
``If they do, we will support them. If they do not, they will get
no support from the U.S., including economic support.''
	   Western officials have admitted Plavsic is trailing in the
Bosnian Serb presidential race, although they have not said how
many ballots remain to be counted. Once an ardent Serb nationalist,
who along with Karadzic backed Serb purges of other ethnic groups,
Plavsic won support from the West when she broke with hard-liners
in summer 1997.
	   A moderate loss at the ballot box would also call into question
the entire U.S.-European strategy, which has been to funnel
millions of dollars in aid to those who support a multi-ethnic,
unified Bosnian state.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the Clinton Administration's message to the elected Bosnian Serb
president echoed Gelbard's statement.
	   ``If you are prepared to implement the provision of Dayton's
requirements, then we are prepared to work with you,'' Rubin told
reporters Friday. ``If you are not, we will respond accordingly.''
	   He added that, so far as the United States could determine, the
election was the freest and fairest in Bosnia's short democratic
history.
	   Bosnians chose candidates for the three-member joint national
presidency, a national parliament and regional and local posts.
Those in the Serb-run area also voted for their president.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
supervised the election, has refused to release any returns, citing
a complicated ballot, a large number of absentee voters and the
need for accuracy.
	   The nationalists have been celebrating their self-declared
triumph since Sunday, raising tensions among the rival Bosnian Serb
camps. International officials warned against such demonstrations
hinting at possible punishment.
	   The OSCE has wide-ranging powers to impose sanctions against
parties _ even disqualify candidates who violate campaign rules.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe have increased diplomatic efforts to restore
stability in Albania after a week of protests by former president
Sali Berisha.
	   Berisha's followers have demanded the resignation of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano since last weekend's assassination of a popular
opposition figure. Azem Hajdari's death set off rioting Sunday and
Monday, in which mobs briefly seized government buildings, state
television and Nano's office.
	   An OSCE delegation, led by Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, was expected in Albania Saturday for meetings with Nano
and Albanian President Rexhap Meidani to ``deliver a message to the
government and the opposition with a view to restoring stability,
political cooperation and good governance,'' an OSCE statement said
Friday.
	   Sources in Tirana said the delegation was also expected to have
some form of talks with Berisha.
	   On Friday, the Albanian parliament voted overwhelmingly to lift
the immunity of former President Sali Berisha, clearing the way for
his arrest and prosecution for allegedly trying to overthrow the
government.
	   Before the vote, Berisha told about 3,000 people Friday in
central Skanderbeg Square that he would continue to oppose Nano's
government, even from jail. ``I'm ready to accept any sacrifice,''
he said.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the government would soon
attempt to serve an arrest warrant, a move which could trigger more
violent unrest.
	   International officials have been urging Nano's government to
move slowly against Berisha and allow a ``cooling off'' period
after the rioting which brought the country to the brink of anarchy
for the second time in 18 months.
	   In its statement, the OSCE, which has played a large role in
coordinating European efforts in the Balkans, also said it was
``imperative to bring to justice'' those responsible for last
weekend's assassination of Hajdari.

Hamas supporters clash with Israeli troops; 32 injured

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's borders with the Palestinian
territories were sealed Saturday after authorities received
warnings that Hamas would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers or
detonate bombs during the two-day Jewish New Year holiday which
begins Sunday.
	   Hamas has said it would avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers
Imad and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot dead by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh Friday, some 3,000 Hamas supporters exhorted
the group's bomb makers to ``blow up, blow up Tel Aviv.''
	   Angry marchers shook their fists in the air. Others waved green
Hamas flags and posters of the Awadallah brothers and Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   After the rally, several hundred activists broke away and walked
toward the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. Twirling slingshot
and shouting slogans, the crowd stoned Israeli soldiers guarding
the settlement. Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring 32
Palestinians, including one who was in serious condition with a
chest injury.
	   Despite the new violence, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was making progress toward an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Ross held a 90-minute meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   After the meeting Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian
parliament, told The Associated Press: ``Mr. Ross managed to bridge
the gaps on some issues.''
	   However a Palestinian cabinet minister said the progress was
negligible. ``The main issues we discussed were not resolved and we
did not achieve any progress,'' said Yasser Abd Rabbo.
	   Qureia added that the Palestinians may agree to delay their
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state next May 5 if their
negotiations with the Israelis are achieving progress.
	   It was the first time the Palestinians had agreed to such a
delay.
	   Ross was to hold more meetings with Israelis and Palestinians
before leaving for Washington on Saturday to brief U.S. President
Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.

Arabs draft resolution demanding fact-finding probe for US-Sudan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In spite of U.S. objections, Arab states
began drafting a resolution Friday demanding the Security Council
authorize a fact-finding mission to investigate U.S. claims that a
Sudanese factory it bombed last month was making chemical weapons.
	   Arab ambassadors met at the United Nations to work out the
details of the resolution, which Bahrain _ the lone Arab on the
council _ was to begin circulating among council members next week,
said the Sudanese ambassador, Elfatih Erwa.
	   If the United States has nothing to hide, he said, it should
approve the investigation.
	   Otherwise, Washington can veto the resolution, he said in an
interview. ``Let them say to the whole world `we do what we want to
do. We don't have to obey international law.'''
	   Washington says the El Shifa plant produced chemical weapons and
was linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect in the
U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. Sudan says the plant produced
medicines and veterinary drugs.
	   Sudan requested a investigation into the U.S. claims immediately
after the Aug. 20 attack, but the council shelved the matter after
initial discussions.
	   The ambassadors launched the resolution a day after the Arab
League condemned the bombing as an ``act of aggression against
Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty and territory, and
a violation of international law.''
	   Erwa said he and other Arab ambassadors also felt emboldened to
push for the resolution following the recent Nonaligned Movement
summit, where 53 heads of government expressed their ``deep
concern'' about the attack and called on Washington to pay Sudan
for damages.
	   The United States has said a U.N. investigation was unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taking from the
grounds of the complex which they say contained EMPTA, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Washington defended its decision to attack the plant Friday
following a call by former President Jimmy Carter to investigate
whether the plant really had a terrorism connection.
	   ``If the evidence shows that the Sudanese are guilty, they
should be condemned for lying and for contributing to terrorist
activities,'' Carter said Thursday. ``Otherwise, we should admit
our error and make amends to those who have suffered loss or
injury.''
	   Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing
Security Council members about the evidence it had to justify the
bombing.
	   ``We want to put the United States in an embarrassing
situation,'' Erwa said. ``We are just asking for a fact-finding
mission, no politics.''

One killed in Angola ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. workers have found the body of a
local employee killed during an ambush on a U.N. convoy by armed
bandits that also left three people injured, a U.N. official said
Friday.
	   All four worked for a local contractor of the World Food
Program.
	   The convoy, consisting of six trucks from the U.N. military
observer mission and 10 WFP trucks, came under fire Wednesday about
20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Lukana, in the north of the
south-western African nation.
	   The body was discovered in a burned vehicle.
	   ``Attacks such as this seriously impact on the ability of
humanitarian organizations to assist those in need, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   More than 372,000 people who have lost their homes in Angola are
being assisted by relief agencies, according to the United Nations.
	   The United Nations has been trying to implement a 1994 peace
accord between the government and the former rebel movement, UNITA,
in the face of renewed fighting between the two sides.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war against the
government for nearly two decades after Angola won independence
from Portugal in 1975.

Burton takes fall into creek during Solheim win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Brandie Burton's shorts survived the round.
The shoe was a total loss.
	   Burton, part of the U.S. team taking on Europe in the Solheim
Cup this weekend, got her foot stuck in mud and fell into a creek
during Friday's afternoon round
	   The shot _ and fall _ was making highlight replays shortly after
it was broadcast.
	   ``I took a little dive in some water. It kept it exciting,''
Burton joked after she and Dottie Pepper defeated Annika Sorenstam
and Catrin Nilsmark 2-up Friday.
	   ``It's embarrassing. But what can you do? Nothing.''
	   Burton was attempting her third shot on the par-5 11th out of a
steep ravine. She got the shot off, but couldn't regain her balance
and splashed down in the mud.
	   Burton completed the round with a mud stain on her right thigh,
but said she had to replace her shoes and socks.
	   ``I almost made it. My foot just got caught,'' she said. ``I
lost my shoe. It was in about three feet of mud.''
	   Burton was embarrassed but not hurt, much to Pepper's relief.
	   ``My poor partner,'' Pepper said. ``I saw it from about
shoulders up _ it was classic. I thought she had saved it. Then I
saw nothing but mud and splash.''
	   The creek running through Muirfield Village Golf Club doesn't
have a name _ yet.
	   ``I think it should be renamed `Burton's Creek,''' Pepper said.

Ship sinks in storm; 384 missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine navy said Saturday it
was searching for 384 people missing after a ship sank in a predawn
storm in waters south of Manila.
	   The Princess of the Orient sank near Fortune island off Batangas
province, said navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Salvador Cuba.
	   Cuba said 14 people were rescued in very rough waters by a
passing fishing boat and four others were picked up by a navy
rescue vessel.
	   Cuba said an official of the Sulpicio Lines, which owns the
ship, told navy authorities the Princess of the Orient left Manila
around 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu City in the Central
Philippines.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing near Fortune
island, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila, and lost
radio contact with its office in Manila around 12:30 a.m. Saturday
(1630 GMT Friday). No other details were immediately available from
the shipping company, Cuba said.
	   Cuba said the officer reported there were 300 passengers,
including seven children, plus 102 crew members.
	   Cuba said rescue efforts were continuing in very rough seas.
	   The storm, with 75 kilometer (46 mile) per hour winds, was
located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila late
Friday afternoon and was forecast to remain stationary for most of
Saturday, weather reports said.

Asian floods raise questions about man's impact on nature

<TEXT>
	   MURHALA, India (AP) _ To Indian farmer Shiv Prasad Paasi, the
Rapti River is a god _ a wayward, capricious, awesomely powerful
being wandering across the fertile Gangetic plains.
	   Paasi was among the millions of Indians, Bangladeshis, Chinese,
Nepalese and South Koreans driven to high ground this summer when
the Rapti and other rivers roared across Asia in the region's worst
flooding in decades. Nearly 6,700 people were killed in the rising
waters.
	   ``Floods are the will of the gods. They are destiny,'' said
Paasi, his submerged fields stretching behind him in a village in
India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.
	   Others question what part man played in the disaster.
	   The indiscriminate cutting of trees for fuel or to make way for
farms reduces the ability of the earth to hold groundwater and take
away the sting of advancing floodwaters as they hurtle down plains.
In addition, global warming _ caused by carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases _ can cause a rise in sea level, coastal flooding
and climate changes, though scientists are hesitant to attribute
any one event to the phenomena at this stage.
	   ``I think that these naturally occurring disasters, though not
necessarily related, are useful in reminding us there may be more
to come,'' said Dick Goldman, director in New Delhi of a U.S.
Agency for International Development project on environment, energy
and business.
	   In India alone this summer, flooding killed over 2,500 people,
submerged tens of thousands of villages in low-lying areas and
destroyed over 10 million acres (4 million hectares) of crops in a
huge northern expanse said to be the most flood-prone plain in the
world.
	   Villagers waded through deep water carrying their children and
pulling along their cattle and bundles of belongings. Floodwaters
washed away tens of thousands of mud thatch houses, submerged
telephone exchanges and power stations and ripped through highways.
	   In China, more than 3,000 people were killed nationwide when the
Yangtze River, the country's longest, was hit by the heaviest
flooding since 1954. Tens of thousands of people remain camped on
dikes or in temporary shelters, which officials say will be
inadequate come winter.
	   Over 900 people died in floods in Bangladesh, where this year's
extraordinary flooding is blamed on unusually heavy rain that fell
nonstop for nearly a month and a higher-than-normal tide in the Bay
of Bengal, probably triggered by a series of undersea earthquakes
last month.
	   More than 270 South Koreans were killed in three weeks of
downpours that began in early August. In the Himalayan kingdom of
Nepal, 246 people were killed due to floods and landslide, the
heaviest toll in five years.
	   ``One common thread between the flooding in Asia is that the
average annual rainfall has shot up, possibly because of the El
Nino effect,'' said Ashok Khosla, president of Development
Alternatives, a leading Indian aid group.
	   The warming effect of the recurring weather pattern known as El
Nino produces more evaporation and therefore more rain. Scientists
are studying whether the effects of El Nino and the cooling La Nina
with which it alternates will be more severe because of global
warming.
	   Forests and grasslands that once slowed rushing flood waters
have been decimated in India, Khosla added. Other countries also
are guilty of deforestation.
	   ``The recent floods in the Yangtze River are a direct impact of
deforestation practices upriver _ this has been admitted by the
Chinese government,'' said A. Karim Ahmed, deputy director for
health, environment and development with the World Resources
Institute in Washington.
	   The extent of the disaster led the Chinese government to ban
logging on the Yangtze's upper reaches as of Sept. 1.
	   Some experts say attempts to control flooding with embankments
and dams has only made the effects worse.
	   Forced by lack of space in cramped cities, poor people who
traditionally didn't live in low-lying areas are making their homes
closer and closer to embankments, believing they will be safe
there. But several embankments have collapsed, in some cases
because they were poorly built or maintained.
	   In China, Premier Zhu Rongji reportedly lambasted local
officials for embezzling construction funds and failing to
adequately reinforce dikes, complaining they might as well have
been made of bean curd.
	   Even strong embankments pose problems, keeping water from
draining away.
	   ``What earlier would be a seven-day flood is now a seven-month
flood, because the water doesn't know where to go.'' said Anil
Agarwal, director of New Delhi's Center for Science and
Environment.
	   This year's floods could be seen as a warning to start dealing
with disaster preparedness and water resource management. Agarwal
called on governments to work to keep villagers out of low-lying
areas, and encourage research in agricultural methods such as
developing types of rice that grow tall enough to survive flooding.
	   But dealing with a looming catastrophe is a tall order for the
cash-strapped governments of Asia.
	   Flooding is expected to hit Indonesia, where a worried Public
Works Ministry is already beginning to see heavier river flows.
Officials acknowledge precautions are inadequate, but say money for
flood protection is scarce in the midst of the Southeast Asia's
worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Infamous Jamaican port to become a theme park

	   PORT ROYAL, Jamaica (AP) _ Some 300 years ago, it was called the
most wicked city on Earth, a place where pirates such as the
infamous Henry Morgan docked in search of rum, prostitutes and boat
repairs.
	   In more recent years, author James Michener labeled it a
``Caribbean hellhole.''
	   But two years hence, the ships dropping anchor in Port Royal are
expected to be modern cruise liners. The visitors looking for
excitement will be tourists. The pirates they encounter will be
actors.
	   The wicked city will have become a Disney-style theme park.
	   Construction is scheduled to begin on the dlrs 50 million
renovation in Port Royal later this year, after five years of
planning. The opening is scheduled for June 2000, and Jamaica has
high hopes for the southeastern outpost near the capital of
Kingston, which has not benefited from a tourism boom on the
Caribbean island's north coast.
	   ``For starters, we expect to bring in 5,000 passengers a week,
which would bring the country about dlrs 500,000 weekly,'' says
Robert Stephens, chairman of the Port Royal Development Company.
``By the fifth year, we will be looking for 25,000 passengers a
week, which would be dlrs 2.5 million. That would mean a lot for
Jamaica.''
	   It would also bring back some of the prosperity that Port Royal
experienced in the days when it was controlled by lawless pirates
who came to town for some free-spending fun. One account tells of a
pirate paying 500 pieces of eight (the Spanish pirate-era currency)
just to watch a woman strip off her clothes.
	   In his epic ``Caribbean,'' Michener describes Port Royal as
having ``no restraints of any kind, and the soldiers stationed in
the fort seemed as undisciplined as the pirates who roared ashore
to take over the place, night after night. They were of all breeds,
all with nefarious occupations.
	   ``In some hectic months, Port Royal averaged a dozen killings a
night, and prominent on the waterfront was a rude gallows from
whose yardarm (hung) the corpse of some pirate who had attacked the
wrong ship at the wrong time.''
	   Earthquakes destroyed much of Port Royal in 1692 and 1907, and
part of the city slid into the sea. ``The ancient gods must have
grown disgusted with the debauchery of the buccaneers who made our
town a cesspool,'' concluded a survivor in ``Caribbean.''
	   Today, little is left but dilapidated buildings, battered roads,
high unemployment and nothing to attract visitors except a few
restaurants offering lobsters and shrimp.
	   Jamaica's government is renovating some of the historic
buildings and private companies are paying for the theme park,
which Stephens says will give people many reasons to visit.
	   ``They will have history presented to them in living fashion,''
he says. ``They can meet Henry Morgan, (Admiral Horatio) Nelson,
Anne Bonney and Mary Read.'' Or at least actors portraying those
historical figures.
	   Cobblestone streets and a bustling pier bedecked with flags will
give visitors a taste of what the town was like in the heady days
of the late 17th century.
	   The developers also plan reenactments of the earthquakes,
complete with sonic booms.
	   The theme park may be the last hope for reviving a destroyed
city where looted Spanish treasure once flowed freely, says
Scotland-born Brian Shields, who operates Morgan's Harbour Hotel.
	   ``The potential is tremendous,'' he says.

	   SALALA, Oman (AP) _ This resort has everything the Arab
vacationer wants during these sweltering summer days _ sand, sea
and rain.
	   Rain? That's right.
	   While vacationers in Western countries bemoan cloudy, rainy
days, they are welcome in the Gulf region where the searing sun
raises summer temperatures to an average of 40 degrees Celsius (104
Fahrenheit).
	   In fact Salala, with highs of 25 degrees Celsius (77
Fahrenheit), has lured a steadily growing number of Gulf citizens
away from vacations in Europe, especially now that falling oil
prices mean falling incomes for many in the region.
	   ``This is my second time here in Salala. It's just perfect. Its
cool, safe and cheap. In Europe, I'd pay at least double or triple
for what I'm getting here,'' said Saeed Mohsen, an Emirates
national.
	   Tourists from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Qatar and Bahrain, drive for days across the desert beginning in
June to enjoy scenes they'd only expect to see in Europe.
	   ``It's unbelievable. The waterfalls, the green fields and
mountains. I never imagined such beauty existed at this time of
year anywhere in the Gulf,'' said Saeed Abdullah, a Saudi who drove
24 hours from Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia with his family.
	   Salala's major asset is its location. Its 30-kilometer (19-mile)
coastline on the edge of the Indian Ocean catches the monsoon
season, reviving waterfalls and transforming barren mountains into
stretches of green.
	   For those looking for more than the scenery, hotels in Salala
offer a swinging nightlife. But the bulk of the tens of thousands
of tourists are happy to don raincoats and hold umbrellas and get
drenched by the monsoon showers.
	   ``This is my sixth time here and I feel completely at home,
unlike the feeling I had when I went to Europe or the United
States. The people are hospitable and the costs are minimal,'' said
Ali Humaid, an Emirates national.
	   The tourists spend an average of 400 Omani riyals (dlrs 1,041)
for a one-week stay that includes everything from accommodation to
shopping.
	   As the slump in world oil prices kicked in, the government spent
hundreds of thousands of riyals (dollars) to develop its tourism
industry and run advertising campaigns in the Gulf to insure an
influx into Oman.
	   That push has yielded impressive results, with the growth rate
of tourists reaching 40 percent this year.
	   Neighboring Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, also is trying
to attract those looking for cooler weather since few of its one
million annual visitors come in summer.
	   To compensate for the lack of rain and cool weather, Dubai has
flown in a Canadian igloo-making team and, using artificial rain
machines, showers 50,000 gallons (190,000 liters) of water of water
on beachgoers.

Former Mexican interior secretary turns in son in murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A man who was once Mexico's powerful interior
secretary has turned his son over to face murder charges, the
Mexico City attorney general's office announced Friday.
	   Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, who also once served as
Chiapas state governor and federal interior secretary, said in a
written statement that his son Jeronimo had disarmed a family
bodyguard and shot Cesar Munoz, the family's driver, for no
apparent reason.
	   ``My son Jeronimo, 34, has for many years suffered behavioral
and psychiatric problems, as a result of which he lived and
received medical treatment in the United States of America for
several years, where it was considered he had been rehabilitated
and was ready to reintegrate into society,'' Gonzalez said.
	   ``We will do what we can, although it might not seem sufficient,
to guarantee the material support that the family of Cesar Munoz
will need,'' he said.
	   ``As parents, we will give Jeronimo the love and moral support
that he deserves as our son and we will be with him to face the
consequences of this act that has brought great pain and shame to
him and to us.''
	   Gonzalez was governor of Chiapas state from 1988 to 1992 and
headed the Interior Secretariat, which is in charge of domestic
political and security affairs, until 1994, when he was forced to
resign due to the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation
Army in his home state.
	   The tragedy hits one of Mexico's best-connected political
families.
	   Gonzalez's wife, Patricia Ortiz Salinas, is a cousin of Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, president from 1988 to 1994, making Jeronimo
Gonzalez the second cousin of the former president.
	   She is also the daughter of a former treasury secretary.
	   Gonzalez himself is the son of a former federal labor secretary
and a nephew of Tomas Garrido Canabal, who was a famed governor of
Tabasco state in the 1920s.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Planning a trip to St. Louis?
	   Forget the Arch. Forget baseball star Mark McGwire.
	   And, throw away your visitors guide because some of the best
places to visit in the Gateway City won't be listed there.
	   The treasures of fun and imagination that make this city special
are nestled in hidden corners just off the beaten touristy path.
	   One of the best places to start a visit to St. Louis is at
Laumeier Sculpture Park in south St. Louis County, just off the
intersection of Interstates 270 and 44.
	   To children and adults alike, the largest sculpture there looks
like a playground.
	   ``I wish you could climb and slide on it,'' says 5-year-old
Sammy Rhoden, staring at 12 giant, red-painted steel cylinders that
stand or slant in every direction.
	   But the cylinders, some standing 65 feet (19.8 meters) high,
were not made to be played on. They were welded together and _
despite the brightness in color _ appear to be fashioned after
classical ruins.
	   ``Whatever it's supposed to be, it's unique,'' says Sammy's
grandmother, Dee, of St. Louis.
	   The park, which sits on 100 acres (40 hectares) of woods, is
filled with sculptures from local and international artists. Grassy
fields that space the sculptures invite picnickers to stop and
rest. A path that winds around the park is a great jogging trail or
a place to walk the dog.
	   Make sure to follow the trail to the far end of the park to see
``House Remembered,'' tree saplings woven and wired together almost
in the shape of a teepee. Then walk the trail around into the woods
to see the ``Laumeier Project,'' a sculpture of red cedar that
resembles a Mayan temple.
	   If you don't have a camera, stop by the gift shop for postcards
of favorite sculptures.
	   From the park, go out to the Museum of Transportation, where
you'll find more than 300 vehicles, including locomotives,
passenger cars, automobiles, streetcars, buses and airplanes.
	   Then drive out to the American Kennel Club Museum of the Dog,
even if you're not a pet owner. The museum, advertised as the only
one of its kind in the world, houses paintings, bronze sculptures
and etchings, some dating back to the 17th century, of man's best
friend.
	   The museum also has a collection of dog collars and rare books.
Don't miss the downstairs photo exhibit of dogs and their heroic
wartime efforts.
	   From there, check out Faust Park in Chesterfield. At the park,
take a ride on the St. Louis Carousel, which sits inside a large
building and has been operating since the 1920s.
	   Then, step back in time with a tour through the park's historic
village filled with 20 original rural homes and service buildings
dating from the 1840s through the 1880s. On the tour, take time to
feed the two cows that seem to beg for some attention.
	   By mid-September, the Butterfly House and Education Center will
open in the park. The Butterfly House is a three-story crystal
conservatory, home to more than 60 species of butterflies.
	   The attraction, the first of its kind in the Midwest, will
feature displays that tell the story of how the butterfly comes to
life and teach owners to care for butterflies at home.
	   A warm afternoon might be best spent in the water at Aquaport,
the area's newest water park.
	   At the park, soak up the sun as a slow-moving current moves you
along a river around the park. Or, choose from five water slides,
depending on your sense of adventure. One will send you down 160
feet (48 meters) into a pool of water. Another glides you through
twists and turns.
	   If you'd rather stick closer to the city, check out Soulard
Market just south of downtown. The market, open Wednesday through
Saturday, offers fresh meats, vegetables, fruits and herbs.
	   While there, walk through the neighborhood itself. With more
than 30 restaurants, taverns and music clubs scattered about,
Soulard is the city's oldest neighborhood.
	   For a Sunday brunch, head to one of several restaurants with
outdoor seating in the Central West End. The stop is a favorite
with bicyclers and walkers passing on their way from nearby Forest
Park. Afterward, browse through the antique shops, art galleries
and clothing stores.
	   But if you've already caught McGwire Mania and want to see the
St. Louis Cardinals slugger do his magic, arrive at the stadium
early enough to browse through the bowling and baseball halls of
fame, located just across the street from Busch Stadium.

Rates at some hotels in Boston top dlrs 400 a night
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHARON L. LYNCH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Queen-sized bed, city view, cable TV. One night,
single occupancy: dlrs 435.
	   That's the cost of a standard room midweek at the grand dame of
the city's hotels, the Boston Harbor Hotel.
	   A spot check in late August also showed the Four Seasons in
Boston charging dlrs 395 a night and the Ritz-Carlton dlrs 405 for
standard single-occupancy rooms.
	   By comparison, The Plaza in Manhattan charges dlrs 335, the
Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, dlrs 280.
	   Also on the high end are The Drake in Chicago, dlrs 275, The
Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, dlrs 280, or The Swissotel
Washington/The Watergate _ once simply known as the Watergate _
dlrs 350.
	   Prices quoted were for standard rooms the night of Thursday,
Sept. 23, a date picked at random.
	   Despite rates that are already out of reach for many business
travelers and tourists _ even Boston's new Holiday Inn costs dlrs
159 _ local hoteliers aren't having any trouble filling their
rooms.
	   Blame high demand and low supply.
	   Boston is one of the 10 most popular tourist destinations
nationwide, but has comparatively few hotel rooms _ about 13,000,
compared to about 29,000 in Washington, D.C., and close to 100,000
in New York City, according to the Massachusetts Lodging
Association.
	   Marni Dacy, director of marketing for the American Hotel and
Motel Association, said Boston is among the top five markets in the
country currently in terms of its occupancy rate. That rate is
expected to top 83.5 percent this year. Only New York and San
Francisco have higher occupancy rates.
	   ``Obviously they can get what they are asking,'' Dacy said.
``People are happy and they're traveling and that's what we're
seeing.''
	   Described in the ``Zagat Survey of U.S. Hotels, Resorts and
Spas'' as ``an elegant, contemporary waterside hotel where it's a
special treat to watch sunrise from beautiful rooms,'' the Boston
Harbor Hotel makes no apology for its price.
	   ``I'm extremely proud of the quality of the hotel,'' said
managing director Francois Nirvaud. But he also noted that his
prices fluctuate daily and often fall below those of the Four
Seasons or the Ritz, his main competition.
	   Pat Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston Convention and
Visitor's Bureau, said the city's top three cater to high-end
corporate and international travelers.
	   About 44 percent of all Boston hotels rooms booked annually go
to business travelers.
	   And hotels are catching on to an old trick of airlines:
overbooking.
	   Art Cantor of the lodging association said hotels are beginning
to use that tactic, along with other aggressive airline pricing
strategies, to increase profits.

Planners of Underground Railroad museum seek dlrs 80- dlrs 90
</HEADLINE>
million &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Planners for the National Underground Railroad
Freedom Center hope to raise dlrs 80 million to dlrs 90 million,
with half from public sources and half from private sources.
	   Ed Rigaud, the center's president, said the building probably
will cost about dlrs 50 million, and the rest of the money will be
used for an endowment and other expenses.
	   The 125,000-square-foot (11,6120-square-meter) museum and park
on the Ohio River will honor the secret network that helped runaway
slaves reach freedom before and during the Civil War. It's
scheduled to open in 2003.
	   Since planning began more than two years ago, the museum has
been discussed as a black equivalent of the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C. Its displays will aim for emotional effect and to
convey the tragedy and heroism of black Americans as they sought
freedom.
	   The center also will have facilities for performing arts and
exhibition galleries to offer a broad view of contemporary black
culture.
	   ``There have been several attempts, many similar projects across
the country to build institutions honoring black history, but
nothing of this magnitude,'' said Walter Blackburn, lead architect
for the project.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; War movie may be stirring interest in battleship park
	   MOBILE, Alabama (AP) _ The number of visitors to Mobile's
Battleship Memorial Park is growing and a renewed interest in World
War II generated by the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' may be one
reason, park officials say.
	   The park features the battleship USS Alabama, which won nine
battle stars in the Pacific during World War II, along with the
submarine USS Drum, which earned 12 battle stars, and 21 historic
airplanes.
	   The park appears to be reversing an eight-year trend of
declining attendance, said Bill Tunnell, park executive director.
	   In the first eight months of 1998, 216,629 people visited the
park, an increase of 15,000 people over the same period in 1997,
Tunnell said.
	   While the immensely popular movie may have stirred interest in
the war machines, another reason for the upturn might be a new
advertising campaign featuring billboards along interstates in
Alabama, Florida and Mississippi, he said.

 &UR; Holistic Retreat: 'Detoxing' on wheat grass juice and veggies
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The oohs and aahs can be heard
from the next room as the guests sidle up to the lunch buffet.
	   Many have just come from a massage, or a facial treatment, or a
swim in the salt-water pool. Their dress _ strictly shorts and
T-shirts _ indicates relaxation and comfort is the order of the
day.
	   But a closer inspection reveals this is no typical spa.
	   The bright-colored foods spread over the buffet are strictly
organic sprouts and veggies _ no cheese, no meat, not even creamy
Italian dressing. For added flavor, there is some dried purple
seaweed.
	   The bar _ open 24 hours a day _ serves water and wheat grass
juice. No booze.
	   And every day, along with other pampering, each guest is treated
to an enema.
	   At the Hippocrates Health Institute, visitors come to clean
their minds and bodies using nutritional intervention, holistic
therapies and changes in lifestyle. Many claim the three-week stay
can cure diseases after traditional medicine has failed.
	   The center was founded in Boston 40 years ago by humanitarian
Ann Wigmore, who believed she cured herself of colon cancer by
using the advice attributed to Hippocrates: ``Let food be your
medicine.''
	   In 1980, the institute moved to a 32-acre (13-hectare) secluded
wooded retreat in West Palm Beach featuring fountains spouting from
watering holes, swings, hammocks and a tepee for quiet
contemplation and guest houses in a Mexican villa setting.
	   Director Brian Clement says about half of the 900 or so who come
each year for the 21-day sessions are sick and seek to get well.
Others are just health-conscious people who want to get even
healthier. Between 30 to 50 people attend each session, which
culminates in a graduation ceremony.

McGwire happy end of chase is in sight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ As much as he's enjoying this home run derby,
Mark McGwire also can't wait for it to end.
	   ``Damn right,'' McGwire said Friday before hitting his
record-setting 64th at Milwaukee. ``I wish we were going to the
playoffs, and it's unfortunate that we're not, but it's going to be
a nice winter. It's not easy, believe me, and I'll probably never
tell the story. I'll probably keep it to myself. But it's a mental
grind.''
	   McGwire, who moved one ahead of Sammy Sosa, said he's turned
down dozens of book proposals.
	   ``I'm so dead set against writing a book,'' he said. ``As far as
I'm concerned, I'll never write a book while I'm playing, and the
chances of writing a book when I retire are probably slim and none.
I just don't believe in that.''
	   Milwaukee figures to play a key role in the race. After a
three-game series against the McGwire's Cardinals, the Brewers play
two games against Sosa's Cubs.
	   Sosa has 10 homers in 10 games against the Brewers and McGwire
had two in eight games against Milwaukee coming in.
	   Brewers batting coach Jim Lefebvre has worked with both players,
as batting coach with Oakland when McGwire hit a rookie-record 49
homers in 1987, and as manager of the Cubs in 1992 and '93. Meeting
reporters as a warmup act for McGwire, Lefebvre said McGwire faces
the bigger challenge.
	   ``Sammy said it beautifully the other day. He said, `I'm playing
for my team. Mark, he's out there to keep it going, to try to hit
home runs,' '' Lefebvre recalled. ``I think it's very difficult for
him.''
	   McGwire shrugged off such talk.
	   ``I know everybody is trying to analyze it, `Well, they face
this pitching staff and this team,' and `He's in the playoff hunt
and he's not,' '' McGwire said. ``Throw it out the door. It comes
down to getting pitches to hit.''
	   McGwire also criticized reporters for making too much of whether
or not either of them homers on a given day.
	   ``I think sometimes people are sitting there going, `Well,
they're at 63. They haven't hit something in a couple days. What's
wrong with them?' My God! Let's just enjoy what's going on instead
of trying to critique everything that's not going on.''
	   And also reiterated that he didn't care whether he finishes
first or second.
	   ``I think what he and I have been doing is fantastic,'' McGwire
said. ``It's like, does it really matter? I don't think it does.''

Battle for Mexican governorship turns physical
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NATALIA PARRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A new openness in Mexico's governing
party has led to an increasingly bitter conflict over the
governorship in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero.
	   At least four people were injured in a club-swinging melee that
erupted Thursday at a ``Meeting of Civility'' _ a joint appearance
by seven candidates for the gubernatorial nomination of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
	   ``There should not be this type of act or provocations when the
PRI is carrying out an internal election,'' Gov. Angel Aguirre
Rivero said Friday, appealing for party unity.
	   As part of national reforms, the party is holding a
gubernatorial primary on Sunday, replacing the old system under
which party leaders rubber-stamped the nominee chosen by the
outgoing governor or the national president.
	   The PRI was encouraged by a primary in the northern state of
Chihuahua, which produced a popular candidate who toppled an
opposition party governor there in July. It was a major victory for
a party which had seen its support erode in recent years.
	   But in Guerrero, where the leftist Democratic Revolution Party
has gained strength, the PRI primary race has become a bitter
affair, with six of the candidates accusing Gov. Aguirre of using
unfair tactics to try to steer Manuel Anorve Banos to the
nomination.
	   Supporters of another candidate, Rene Juarez, shouted down
Anorve as he tried to speak at the event in Atoyac de Alvarez,
about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of here.
	   Anorve supporters, apparently led by a former state police
director, toppled a former mayor backing Juarez off a table, and
militants attacked one another with yard-long clubs as others
scattered.
	   Four people were treated at local hospitals. None of the
injuries were serious.
	   Both Anorve and Juarez earlier in the campaign had complained of
death threats.
	   The clash led party officials to cancel another planned meeting
which had been scheduled for Acapulco, where the two candidates
have strong groups of supporters. It was held in the state capital
of Chilpancingo instead.
	   Aguirre late Thursday denounced the clash and asked party
officials to punish those responsible.

Memorabilia dealer gives No. 61 back to Sosa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa got No. 61 back. Who gets No. 62 is
now up to a judge.
	   Steve Ryan, a sports memorabilia collector who paid dlrs 10,000
for No. 61, gave the ball back to Sosa before Friday's game against
the Cincinnati Reds. In return, Sosa autographed baseballs for
Ryan's sons, Eric, 9, and Matthew, 6, posed for pictures, and will
give them a jersey and a bat.
	   ``My kids got to meet him. You know how cool it is that my kids
got to meet Sammy?'' Ryan said, sounding like a kid himself.
``These guys are such big Sammy Sosa fans, this was more worth it
to them than any amount of money in the world.''
	   Try telling that to the guys who are fighting over No. 62. Cook
County Circuit Court Judge Michael Getty issued a temporary
restraining order Friday prohibiting Brendan Cunningham from
selling the ball until its ownership is determined.
	   The ball will be held in a ``mutually agreeable'' location.
	   ``That ball belongs to me, right?'' Sosa said, laughing, when
asked about the legal wranglings.
	   Sosa hit Nos. 61 and 62 last Sunday to move past Roger Maris and
into a tie with Mark McGwire in the race for the single-season home
run record, the most storied mark in baseball. Both balls sailed
out of Wrigley Field and onto Waveland Avenue.
	   Gary ``Moe'' Mullins claims he got No. 62, but said he was
bitten and scratched before Cunningham ripped the ball from his
hands. Mullins filed a police report, and when that didn't get him
the ball back, a lawsuit.
	   Cunningham claims he wants to give the ball back to Sosa, who
has promised to give it to the Hall of Fame.
	   ``The existence of this lawsuit ... may not make it possible for
him to do so,'' said Stephen Libman, Cunningham's lawyer.
	   Sosa said he'll give No. 61 to the Hall of Fame if it wants it.
The only ball the Hall can't have is No. 63, a grand slam he hit
Wednesday in San Diego.
	   That one is for his mother.
	   ``(Nos.) 61 and 62, they belong to all the American people and
the Hall of Fame,'' Sosa said. ``If (the hall) doesn't need (61),
I'll take it home and give it to my mother.''
	   John Witt caught No. 61, which tied Roger Maris' single-season
home run mark. But Witt, an unemployed father of two who is
recently divorced, sold the ball for dlrs 10,000 later that night
to Ryan, owner of North Shore Sports, a sports memorabilia
business.
	   Ryan said he could have re-sold the ball for as much as dlrs
50,000, but decided to give it back to Sosa because of his kids.
	   ``We're from Chicago. If I wasn't from Chicago, it might have
been different,'' Ryan said. ``He should have that ball back. For
my kids to meet him, this was so much better.''

Saxby-Junna misses third gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian walker Jane Saville
stepped out of the shadow of two-time champion Kerry Saxby-Junna
for the first time Saturday to claim the Commonwealth Games gold
medal.
	   Saville, 23, took 43 minutes, 59 seconds to complete the
10-kilometer walk after making a decisive break with about
1-kilometer to go.
	   Saxby-Junna, who won the first women's walk title in Auckland in
1990 and defended it in Victoria 1994, finished with silver. Lisa
Kehler of England was third.
	   Yuan Yu Fang, a former Chinese star recently given Malaysian
citizenship and the host nation's best chance of a track and field
medal, was disqualified for lifting midway through the race while
engaged in a three-way battle for the lead with the two
Australians.
	   Saville paid tribute to Saxby-Junna, who has set more than 30
world best times during her career, and said she was the reason she
had remained in competitive walking.
	   Saxby-Junna said she hoped to be around and walking at the 2000
Olympics.
	   ``I knew if I hung on to Jane I had a better sprint than her but
I just couldn't hang on,'' said Saxby-Junna. ``She kept coming back
at me and when she made that initial sprint she knew she had me.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers were searching in heavy seas
Saturday for survivors from a ship that sank before dawn with 402
people aboard in a storm in waters south of Manila.
	   The Philippine navy said it had confirmed that 33 people had
been rescued from the Princess of the Orient, including 14 people
who were picked up in very rough waters by a passing fishing boat.
	   A seaside resort owner called a Manila radio station and said
his staff had sighted rescue boats off the coast shooting flares in
the air. Navy rescue ships were sent to the area.
	   The aide of a military colonel, who was aboard the ship, also
reported to a radio station that he had received a desperate
cellular telephone call late Friday night from the colonel asking
for help.
	   ``He asked to contact all those in Manila who could help rescue
them. There was noise in the background, people were shouting,''
the aide said.
	   The ship sank near Fortune island off Batangas province, navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Salvador Cuba said.
	   Cuba said an official of Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship,
told navy authorities the ship left Manila around 8 p.m. (1200 GMT)
Friday for Cebu City in the central Philippines.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing near Fortune
island, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila, and lost
radio contact with its office in Manila around 12:30 a.m. Saturday
(1630 GMT Friday). No other details were immediately available from
the shipping company, Cuba said.
	   Cuba said the officer reported there were 300 passengers,
including seven children, and 102 crew members aboard.
	   Cuba said rescue efforts were continuing in very rough seas.
	   The storm, with 75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds, was
located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila late
Friday and was forecast to remain stationary for most of Saturday,
weather reports said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.

Cuba reports 1 million tourists so far this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba reported Friday that it has received
more than 1 million tourists this year _ reaching the mark more
than a month before last year's record pace.
	   Eduardo Rodriguez, vice minister of tourism, said the country
expects 1.4 million tourists this year, 1.7 million next year and 2
million in 2000. His remarks were reported by the government's
Prensa Latina news agency, monitored here.
	   Rodriguez said the country's tourism reached the 1 million mark
for the first time in December 1996. It hit the 1 million mark in
November last year.
	   Canada and Italy have been the largest sources of tourism to
Cuba, though Rodriguez said tourism from Germany this year had
increased by 63 percent over last year to surpass Spain as Cuba's
third-largest tourism market.
	   Tourism from the United States is sharply restricted by laws
banning most Americans from spending money on the communist island.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ It is safe to drink the water at last
in Sydney, the city that will host the 2000 Summer Olympics, after
weeks of fear of parasite infestation, health authorities said
Saturday.
	   More than 3 million Sydney residents have had to boil drinking
water or buy bottled water in a series of health alerts over high
levels of cryptosporidium and giardia found in the water system
since late July.
	   State Health Director General Michael Reid said Saturday's
all-clear followed assessments by an independent panel of experts
established after the alarm was first raised.
	   ``New South Wales Health has monitored levels of illness in the
community since the first alert and there's no evidence that people
are getting sick from the water supply,'' he said.
	   ``The presence of contamination is infrequent and at very low
levels and people who haven't used the tap every day should let the
water run for at least two minutes,'' he said.
	   A new poll published Saturday found that a third of respondents
had ignored boil-water warnings either some or all of the time.
	   But the health department, pharmacies and doctors have not found
any statistically significant increase in gastrointestinal diseases
during the crisis.
	   Some scientists have argued that the bugs are harmless algae
mistaken for the dangerous parasites, but the water company has
denied that.
	   The government has been unable to isolate the source of the
contamination.
	   A cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1993 was
blamed for the deaths of about 100 people and for making about
400,000 people ill.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.

	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Emotional Dottie Pepper led Team USA's
Solheim Cup assault with two points Friday, becoming the leading
scorer in the event's history.
	   But she has her eyes on another, bigger prize. One that's 18
inches tall and made of crystal.
	   ``It's not done yet,'' the veteran of all five Solheim Cups
said. ``You just can't stop after day one. You have to keep
pushing.''
	   Pepper hit the Americans' first shot of the day and it was no
coincidence that it was her groups that scored the first and last
points as Team USA took a 5 1/2-2 1/2 lead over Team Europe.
	   In the last Solheim two years go in Wales, the United States led
5-3 after the first day then was blitzed 6-2 in the second-day
matches. The Americans regrouped to win 10 points in 12 singles
matches on Sunday to take a 17-11 victory.
	   Remembering that, Pepper said the U.S. team can't rest.
	   ``This just means we played well on the opening day,'' she said.
``There's three more sets of matches still to go off that first tee
and there are a lot more points to be won. We played really well,
but we're only one-third of the way through.''
	   The United States, seeking its third straight team title, took
three of four points in the morning foursome, or alternate-shot,
matches, then came back to win 2 1/2 of a possible four points in
the afternoon fourball, or best-ball, matches.
	   ``They did some playing, didn't they?'' said Team USA captain
Judy Rankin.
	   Pepper was the lynchpin, energized by the flag-waving crowd and
continually hitting the big shots needed not just to win holes but
to prevent the opposition from winning them. Three times during the
afternoon match, she saved par and halved holes with long putts.
	   Pepper teamed with Juli Inkster in the morning at Muirfield
Village Golf Club, then was paired with a soggy Brandie Burton in
the afternoon.
	   Pepper's teams won 3 and 1 and 2-up, improving her record to
7-3-1 in Solheim foursomes and fourball matches. The two points
also gave her 10 1/2 in Solheim play _ the most of anyone in the
series.
	   ``Keeping the Cup here is a lot more important than anything
individual,'' she said.
	   In the biggest rout of the day, Pat Hurst and Rosie Jones rolled
to a 7 and 5 victory over Europe's Lisa Hackney and Sophie
Gustafson. Hurst, who also picked up two points, and Jones, cheered
by Ohio State fans in the gallery, led 6-up through nine holes.
	   Betsy King and Chris Johnson halved their best-ball match
against Laura Davies and Charlotta Sorenstam.
	   France's Marie Laure de Lorenzi, playing with Helen Alfredsson,
salvaged a point for Europe when she holed a 35-foot (10.5-meter)
sand shot from behind the 17th hole for a 2 and 1 victory over
Kelly Robbins and Sherri Steinhauer.
	   ``It hasn't gone really according to our plans today,'' Team
Europe captain Pia Nilsson said. ``The Americans played really,
really well. But I think we're OK, because we're not far away from
playing great. There are still 20 more points to go, so we have a
lot left.''
	   Burton struggled with her game throughout the day but still will
be featured on most of the nightly sports highlight shows.
	   Burton had to stand in the slippery, marshy area around the
creek which snakes across the par-5 11th hole as she hit her third
shot from almost eye level on the steep bank. She slipped as she
swung, hitting the ball into the creek, then lost her balance and
fell backwards. She tried to jump across the creek, but fell on the
far bank, losing her shoe in the muck. Her shorts and shoes were
covered with mud.
	   ``I took a little dive in some water,'' Burton said. ``It made
it exciting. It's pretty embarrassing, but what can you do?
Nothing.''
	   In the morning matches, Inkster nearly aced the 16th hole and
Pepper followed by hitting the 5-foot (1.5-meter) birdie putt that
all but assured the Americans' first point.
	   After Davies and Trish Johnson conceded the 17th hole and the
match, the large partisan crowd circling the green shouted,
``USA!'' Inkster smiled and raised her fist to the gallery while
Pepper tipped her visor and waved.
	   ``You hope to get on the board first like we did,'' Pepper said.
``The team wants to know what's happening in front of them.''
	   Each match is worth a point in the Solheim, the women's
equivalent of the men's Ryder Cup. The United States needs 14 of
the 28 possible points to retain the cup; Team Europe needs 14 1/2
points.
	   Saturday's matches will also feature alternate-shot twosomes in
the morning and best ball in the afternoon. On Sunday, all 12
singles will play in head-to-head matches.

McGwire hits 64th homer

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his 64th home run Friday
night, pulling out of a tie with Sammy Sosa in the race for the
U.S. Major League Baseball home run record.
	   McGwire hit a 3-1 pitch from Rafael Roque 417 feet (125 meters)
into the left-center field bleachers for a two-run homer in the
fourth inning. McGwire, who hit three pitches out of County Stadium
during batting practice, took a curtain call after returning to the
dugout.
	   Before Monday, McGwire was homerless in 18 at-bats since
surpassing Roger Maris' record on Sept. 8. Now he has homered twice
in four games to regain the lead in a race he's trailed only once
all season.
	   County Stadium was the site of Hank Aaron's 755th and last home
run, off Dick Drago on July 20, 1976.
	   Informed of the tidbit before the game, McGwire said he'd love
to meet Aaron.
	   ``Yeah, he's the King of Swat, right? He's the home run guy,''
McGwire said.
	   Sosa was 0-for-4 with a strikeout and a run scored in the Cubs'
loss to Cincinnati earlier Friday.
	   Before the fourth, Roque retired nine of the first 10 batters,
allowing only McGwire to reach on a walk.
	   McGwire's homer followed Ray Lankford's leadoff double and tied
the game at 2-2.
	   It was only his third homer against Milwaukee pitching, which
has surrendered 10 homers to Sosa. It was also his 14th homer
against left-handed pitching, which had held him to a .246 average
entering the game. His last two homers have come against lefties.
	   The Pirates' Jason Christiansen surrendered No. 63 in a
pinch-hit appearance on Tuesday.
	   McGwire has 175 homers in three seasons and 451 overall. He
needs one more to tie Carl Yastrzemski for 20th on the career list.
	   The Cardinals have eight games to go, all but two of them at
home, where he has homered 33 times. They conclude their road
schedule with games Saturday and Sunday in Milwaukee.
	   McGwire has 88 homers, 178 RBIs and 198 walks in 197 career
games with the Cardinals. He hit his sixth career pinch homer off
Jason Christiansen on Tuesday in the first game of a double-header.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers searched heavy seas Saturday
for survivors from a ship that sank before dawn with 402 people
aboard in a storm in waters south of Manila.
	   The Philippine navy said it had confirmed that 136 people had
been rescued from the Princess of the Orient, including 14 people
who were picked up in very rough waters by a passing fishing boat.
	   A seaside resort owner called a Manila radio station and said
his staff had sighted lifeboats off the coast shooting flares in
the air. Navy rescue ships were sent to the area.
	   The aide of a military colonel aboard the ship also told a radio
station that he had received a desperate cellular telephone call
late Friday night from the colonel asking for help.
	   ``He asked to contact all those in Manila who could help rescue
them. There was noise in the background, people were shouting,''
the aide said.
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by the fishing boat, told
The Associated Press he was sleeping in the ship's economy section
at about 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) when he heard shouting and felt his bed
tilting. He put on a life jacket, rushed outside and jumped into
the water, along with many others.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the water until about 4 a.m. (2000 GMT), when he was
picked up by the fishing boat.
	   The ship sank near Fortune island off Batangas province, navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Salvador Cuba said.
	   Cuba said an official of Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship,
told navy authorities the ship left Manila around 8 p.m. (1200 GMT)
Friday for Cebu City in the central Philippines.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing near Fortune
island, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila and lost
radio contact with its office in Manila around 12:30 a.m. Saturday
(1630 GMT Friday). No other details were immediately available from
the shipping company, Cuba said.
	   Cuba said the officer reported there were 300 passengers,
including seven children, and 102 crew members aboard.
	   Cuba said rescue efforts were continuing in very rough seas.
	   The storm, with 75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds, was
located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila late
Friday and was forecast to remain stationary for most of Saturday,
weather reports said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.

Researchers call butter as deadly as cigarettes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Butter, which is found in almost
every pantry in the Western world, has been branded as deadly as
cigarettes and should carry a similar health warning, researchers
in New Zealand said Saturday.
	   The Auckland University medical researchers said butter is as
dangerous to the human heart as cigarettes and want shoppers
constantly reminded of that fact.
	   Rod Jackson, associate professor of epidemiology at Auckland
University Medical School, said a diet high in saturated fats _
such as butter and other dairy products _ has made New Zealand
among the top 10 nations in the world for occurrence of heart
disease.
	   ``I believe butter should have health warnings on the packets
telling people they are risking heart attacks,'' Jackson said.
	   ``It should be treated like a cigar _ only taken once a year at
Christmas.''
	   Dairy farmers immediately branded the warning idea a ridiculous
scare tactic.
	   ``There's nothing wrong with butter in moderation. If you
listened to everything these health experts said, you wouldn't go
outside,'' said Federated Farmers' spokesman Kevin Wooding.
	   Farmers' lobby president Malcolm Bailey said the evidence
against butter was ``flimsy and misleading,'' and that butter also
contained ``life-enhancing properties.''
	   People who enjoyed butter should not be deterred from using it
by the ``intolerant few'' who don't, Bailey said.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Jaret Wright got his first win in nearly a
month despite walking seven in five innings as the Cleveland
Indians beat the Kansas City Royals 4-1 Friday night.
	   Wright (12-9) allowed one run and four hits in a shaky tuneup
for the postseason. The seven walks were a career high and most by
a Cleveland pitcher this year.
	   The win was Wright's first since beating Baltimore 6-3 on Aug.
21. He had gone 0-2 with two no-decisions.
	   Paul Shuey pitched two scoreless innings for his first save
since April 5, 1997.
	   Jim Thome's bases-loaded double gave Cleveland a 2-0 lead in the
first inning off Kevin Appier (1-1). Mark Whiten followed with a
two-run single.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Athletics 1 &QC; 
	   In Arliington Texas, John Burkett pitched eight strong innings
and Todd Zeile and Lee Stevens homered to lead the Texas Rangers
past the Oakland Athletics.
	   The Rangers won their fourth straight, while Oakland has lost
five in a row.
	   Burkett (8-13), who won for the first time since Aug. 6, gave up
one run and four hits, struck out one and walked none.
	   John Wetteland, who set the Rangers' save record Thursday night,
allowed two hits to start the ninth before getting three straight
outs for his 42nd save.
 &UR; Tigers 5, Twins 4, 11 innings
	   In Detroit, Tony Clark hit a leadoff homer in the 11th inning as
the Detroit Tigers handed the Minnesota Twins their ninth straight
loss.
	   Clark hit the first pitch of the 11th from Mike Trombley (5-5)
off the right-field roof for his career-high 33rd homer.
	   The Tigers had tied the game 4-4 in the ninth on Damion Easley's
two-out solo homer. Easley's 25th homer of the season and third in
two nights came with two outs off Rick Aguilera, who had converted
his previous 15 save opportunities.
	   Matt Anderson (5-1) got two outs in the 11th for the victory.
 &UR; Devil Rays 6, Blue Jays 1
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Paul Sorrento hit a two-run homer
and drove in three runs as Tampa Bay beat Toronto.
	   Bryan Rekar (2-7) won for the first time since July 27, giving
up one runs and three hits in eight innings. Rekar, who struck out
six and walked none, had gone 0-5 in his previous eight starts.
	   The Devil Rays are 5-3 during a season-ending 18-game stretch
against playoff contenders.
	   Jose Canseco hit his 43rd homer, a first-inning solo shot, and
is one homer away from matching his career-high, set with Oakland
in 1991.

	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Mia Hamm scored her 100th
international career goal, then added her 101st as the United
States toppled Russia 4-0 Friday night in the U.S. Women's Cup.
	   Both goals came courtesy of long crosses from Tiffeny Milbrett,
who celebrated her 100th international game with two goals of her
own.
	   The centenary strike before a capacity crowd of 13,125 at
Frontier Field was a Hamm classic. Pouncing on a failed clearance
in the penalty box in the 35th minute, she fired hard from eight
yards into the far top corner.
	   ``I just cracked it,'' she said. ``When I hit it, I didn't see
it but when I looked up, I saw it hit the net. It's one of those
goals that you'll take.
	   ``It's very special, I'll never do it again so you want to make
the most of it.''
	   Hamm, 26, was the youngest player ever on the national team when
she made her debut in August 1987 at age 15. Her 101 goals in 155
international games puts her seven goals short of tying the women's
world scoring record.
	   Elisabetta Vignotta of Italy netted 108 times in 110
international games during the 1970s. Countrywoman Carolina Morace
is the only other player to pass 100, scoring 105 goals in 151
games from the late 1970s until her retirement last year.
	   Hamm holds the American, four more than teammate Michelle Akers.
	   The United States takes on South American champion Brazil in the
deciding final game Sunday in Richmond, Virginia. In their last
meeting in December, Brazil defeated the Americans, the defending
Olympic champion, 1-0 at Sao Paulo.
	   Milbrett opened the scoring in the 25th minute, flicking in
Hamm's cross from 12 yards. Picking up another cross from Joy
Fawcett three minutes later, Milbrett turned sharply and slammed
her second just inside the near post.
	   Hamm headed home Milbrett's cross from close range in the 45th
minute. She was substituted in the 58th minute.
	   The Brazilians humbled Mexico 11-0 in the opening game Friday at
Frontier Field. Brazil is one of 10 teams already qualified for the
1999 Women's World Cup, to be staged in the United States.
	   On Saturday, Hamm scored twice as the United States hammered
Mexico 9-0.

Ten years after Seoul, Ben Johnson still dreams of comeback
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Even after 10 years, he still would have held the
title of fastest man in the world.
	   And now Ben Johnson is trying reclaim what he says he never
should have lost. The muscle-bound blur busted for using steroids
at the Seoul Olympics is ready to return to the track at age 36.
	   ``It kind of feels sad to think how fast I could have gone,'' he
said.
	   He did go fast, anyway, amazingly fast, blowing past Carl Lewis
in the 100 meters for a gold medal and world record of 9.79 at the
1988 Games. Stripped of the medal and the record, he was suspended
for two years, and banned for life in 1993 when he again tested
positive for steroids.
	   His second comeback bid rests on a legal battle to overturn that
ban by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. He is to
appear in Ontario Court on Monday.
	   Based on assessments from his agent and lawyers, Johnson is
optimistic about the outcome, and talks of returning to world-class
competition by December or January, perhaps at meets in Australia
or South Africa.
	   He has been training regularly throughout his long exile from
track, and estimates he'd need eight weeks of intense work to reach
peak form. He says he recently ran 80 meters in 8.14, and believes
he could start his comeback with a 100-meter time of around 10.10.
	   ``My dream is to come back again and compete against the best in
the world,'' he said.
	   Since his lifetime ban he's dabbled in real estate and made
several public appearances to raise cash and draw attention to his
case. He's traveled to Europe and Japan several times, where the
media remain fascinated by him, and last year resorted to such
antics as racing against a Toronto radio sportscaster.
	   Johnson's agent and manager, Morris Chrobotek, is engaged in a
two-pronged offensive to get his client back on the track. He's
collecting documents that he says cast doubt on the 1993 drug test,
while focusing the court case on the issue of restraint of trade.
	   ``Let's say Ben was driving, and maybe he was speeding,''
Chrobotek said. ``Okay, you take his license away _ but not for the
rest of his life. Enough is enough.''
	   Johnson's campaign has received little support from anyone at
the higher levels of Canadian track and field, whether officials or
athletes.
	   But there seems to be a shift in Canadian media coverage of him,
treating him less like a villain and more like someone who became a
scapegoat for a widespread problem.
	   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. aired a lengthy TV documentary
this month that raised the question of whether Johnson was treated
fairly. Among those interviewed was Mark McKoy, who came back to
win a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 after a two-year
suspension.
	   ``I've always thought Ben was shafted,'' McKoy said. ``You get
caught, you do your time, you come back.''
	   Johnson's quest is followed with interest at the Canadian Center
for Ethics in Sport, which helps administer drug testing on behalf
of Canada's sports federations.
	   The center's chief executive, Victor Lachance, said Johnson is
entitled to his day in court, but suggested the sprinter might have
been better off persevering with an appeal to the IAAF.
	   Lachance said the spate of drug scandals in sports this year
underscores the scope of the problem, but disputed the notion that
this should generate sympathy for Johnson.
	   ``There is no question there is doping going on, and no question
more needs to be done to ensure we have a level playing field,''
Lachance said. ``But the fact that other people were not caught
doesn't mean anything unjust was done to Mr. Johnson.''
	   Canadian sports officials are growing weary of Johnson's
long-running reinstatement campaign and believe the lifetime ban
was proper, said Hugh Wilson, director of athlete and coach
development for Athletics Canada, the national governing body of
the sport.
	   ``People want Ben Johnson to have a good life and make the most
of the gifts that he has, but not here in track and field,'' he
said.
	   Johnson isn't alone in his exile. His former coach, Charlie
Francis, remains banned from coaching for life, although he appears
regularly at major Canadian meets and is sought for technical
advice.
	   Jamie Astaphan, the doctor who admitted administering illegal
drugs to Johnson, moved back to his native St. Kitts in the
Caribbean. He and Johnson contend that the positive drug test in
Seoul resulted from American resentment that Johnson was outrunning
Lewis. Johnson, however, also has admitted that he took steroids.
	   ``I beat the Americans _ that was the problem,'' he said. ``If I
was American, this never would have happened.''
	   His bitterness extends to Canada and the United States, and he
plans to move abroad, perhaps to Italy, once his reinstatement case
is resolved. Europeans, he said, have been more supportive than
North Americans, and he never wants to race again for Canada.

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Cecil Fielder was cut for the second time this
season, this time by the Cleveland Indians.
	   Fielder, who will turn 35 Monday, was just 5-for-35 with the
Indians (.143), who signed him Aug. 13. He struck out 13 times and
didn't drive in any runs.
	   Fielder had four singles and one double with the Indians, his
fourth major league team. Sexson, a rookie, had 11 homers, 35 RBIs
and a .338 average in 157 at-bats going into Friday night's game
against Kansas City.
	   Fielder batted .241 with the Angels, hitting 17 homers and
driving in 68 runs in 103 games. Anaheim designated him for
assignment on Aug. 5.
	   He hit 28 or more homers in seven straight seasons before
falling off to 13 for the New York Yankees in 1997.
	   In his career, Fielder has 319 homers and 1,008 RBIs. His best
season came in 1990, when he returned to the major leagues after a
year in Japan and hit 51 homers for Detroit with 132 RBIs.

Campas retains junior middleweight title on De La Hoya undercard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Yory Boy Campas kept his chances in line for a
fight with Oscar De La Hoya by stopping an outclassed Larry Barnes
on Friday night to retain his junior middleweight title.
	   The fight was stopped at the end of the third round after ring
doctor Flip Homansky recommended that Barnes not be allowed to
continue because of swelling around his left eye.
	   Campas, a possible opponent for De La Hoya sometime next spring,
retained his International Boxing Federation title with the
lopsided win. The fight was on the undercard of the De La
Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez welterweight title fight.
	   Campas, 153 pounds (69 kilograms), landed almost at will from
the opening bell, but was never able to put Barnes down. Barnes,
153 1/2 (69 kilograms), tried to move forward against Campas but
could not land effectively.
	   Campas improved to 72-2, while Barnes fell to 44-3.
	   ``I had total control of the fight,'' Campas said.
	   In a second 12-round fight, Antonio Diaz battered Hector Quiroz
in the later rounds before finally stopping him with a left
uppercut at 1:05 of the 12th round.
	   The win was a defense by Diaz of the super lightweight
championship of the International Boxing Association, a fringe
boxing organization.
	   Diaz, who was the chief sparring partner for De La Hoya in his
training for Chavez, improved to 23-2, while Quiroz fell to 25-3-1.
though, until he was knocked down by a left uppercut in the final
round.
	   Punch stats showed Diaz threw 1,020 in the fight, landing 399.
Quiroz threw 801, landing 301. Referee Jay Nady stepped in and
stopped the bout after Quiroz got back up.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers searched heavy seas Saturday
for survivors from a ferryboat that sank before dawn with 402
people aboard in a storm in waters south of Manila.
	   The Philippine navy said it had confirmed that 136 people had
been rescued from the Princess of the Orient, including 14 people
who were picked up in very rough waters by a passing fishing boat.
	   A seaside resort owner called a Manila radio station and said
his staff had sighted lifeboats off the coast shooting flares in
the air. Navy rescue ships were sent to the area.
	   A military colonel on board the ship called his aide in Manila
by cellular telephone and desperately asked for help, his aide
said.
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by the fishing boat, told
The Associated Press he was sleeping in the ship's economy section
at about 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) when he heard shouting and felt his bed
tilting.
	   He put on a life jacket, rushed outside as the ship's lights
went out and jumped into the water, swimming quickly away to escape
the ship's suction as it sank, he said.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the rough seas until about 4 a.m. (2000 GMT), when he
was picked up by the fishing boat.
	   Geronimo Socrates, the skipper of the fishing boat, said he had
a difficult time maneuvering his boat to the survivors because of
the big waves.
	   ``They were very scared. One of them clutched me and did not let
go. I told him, `Stay calm, we will save all of you.'''
	   The inter-island ferry sank near Fortune island off Batangas
province, navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Salvador Cuba said.
	   Cuba said an official of Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship,
told navy authorities the ship left Manila around 8 p.m. (1200 GMT)
Friday for Cebu City in the central Philippines.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing near Fortune
island, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila, and lost
radio contact with its office in Manila around 12:30 a.m. Saturday
(1630 GMT Friday). No other details were immediately available from
the shipping company, Cuba said.
	   Cuba said the officer reported there were 300 passengers,
including seven children, and 102 crew members aboard.
	   Cuba said rescue efforts were continuing in very rough seas.
	   Tropical storm Vicki, with 75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour
winds, was located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of
Manila late Friday and was forecast to remain stationary for most
of Saturday, weather reports said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.
	   Ferries are the main mode of transportation among the
Philippines' more than 7,000 islands.
	   In 1987, the Philippines suffered the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster when the ferry Dona Paz collided with a tanker,
killing 4,341 people.

Jewish sailor loses religious discrimination case in Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Canadian military was within its rights to
turn down a Jewish sailor who wanted to serve in the Middle East
during the Gulf War, a federal court judge has ruled.
	   The decision by Judge Paul Rouleau on Friday effectively leaves
it up to the Canadian military to use its discretion in selecting
or rejecting soldiers for a particular mission.
	   The military's policy had been challenged by Andrew Liebmann,
who wanted the court to declare he was a victim of religious
discrimination because he was denied a coveted job in the Gulf nine
years ago.
	   Liebmann was living in Vancouver in late 1990 when tensions
began rising in the Middle East.
	   His commander recommended Liebmann for the position of executive
assistant to the commander of the Canadian contingent in the Gulf.
He received instructions to prepare for immediate duty and obtained
the required inoculations.
	   But just before departing, Liebmann said was told he wouldn't be
going because he was Jewish and thus might be a source of friction
in dealings with Arab officials.
	   Liebmann's lawyer, Robert Kincaid, said the federal court ruling
sends a message to all military candidates that they should hide
their ethnicity, culture and religion if they want to advance.
	   The military's selection policy says soldiers can be excluded
from missions because of ``cultural, religious, or other
sensitivities.''
	   The judge accepted the military's argument that the policy is
intended to protect the lives of soldiers and ensure a mission is
effectively carried out.

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane watches were posted
from St. Lucia to Anguilla in the eastern Caribbean as Hurricane
Georges, packing 105 mph (170 kph) winds, bore down on the small
islands.
	   Residents were calm but were taking the strengthening storm
seriously.
	   ``I just pulled up two of my boats out of the water,'' said
David Armour on Dominica, the mountainous island that lies directly
in Georges' path. ``The gas stations are full. People are filling
their tanks.''
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Friday (0300 GMT Saturday), the National
Hurricane Center in Miami said Georges was located at 14.0 north
latitude and 50.0 west longitude, about 740 miles (1,185
kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles.
	   The hurricane's sustained winds were estimated at 105 mph (170
kph) with gusts up to 125 mph (200 kph) _ and a further
strengthening over the next day was forecast.
	   ``Georges is currently a category 2 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and is forecast to strengthen into a
category 3 within the next 24 hours,'' said a statement from the
Hurricane Center.
	   The hurricane was moving west at 20 mph (32 kph) and was
expected to continue on the same course for the next 24 hours,
which would bring it to the eastern Caribbean islands Saturday
night and Sunday.
	   Hurricane watches were posted Friday in St. Lucia, Dominica,
Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saba, Antigua, St. Maarten, Anguilla and
other islands as disaster preparedness teams met to plan for
Georges, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season and the first
to threaten the Caribbean islands.
	   ``It looks like it's coming straight for us in Dominica,'' said
Armour, assistant director of the Anchorage Hotel. ``We're going to
start preparing the hotel tomorrow (Saturday) by boarding up the
windows and collecting food and water.''
	   A few miles further south in Martinique, residents calmly
stocked up on water, candles and batteries Friday. In nearby
Guadeloupe, like Martinique a French territory, prefect Jean Fedini
went on the radio to urge citizens to stock up on supplies.
	   Meanwhile, the sound of hammers on nails rang out across St.
Maarten, where residents still vividly remember the devastating
direct hit from Hurricane Luis three years ago.
	   In Anguilla, government workers began storing important files in
safe places in offices, in case the hurricane hits over the weekend
when employees are not available to safeguard records.
	   Georges could affect a large area: hurricane force winds
extended 30 miles (45 km) from the center, and tropical storm force
winds extended outward up to 125 miles (205 km).
	   Fears were mounting as far north as Puerto Rico, the U.S.
territory that is home to some 4 million _ far more than all the
Lesser Antilles combined. Supermarkets were packed Friday night
with people buying water and emergency food supplies.

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ This time Oscar De La Hoya made sure there
would be no excuses.
	   De La Hoya beat and bloodied Julio Cesar Chavez once again
Friday night before Chavez's corner signaled their fighter wanted
no more while sitting on a stool after the eighth round of their
WBC welterweight title fight.
	   Chavez was bleeding from the mouth and nose and had cuts over
both eyes, and had just taken a beating in the final minute of the
eighth round when his corner signaled to referee Richard Steele
that Chavez would fight no more.

	   It was the second time De La Hoya stopped Chavez, but this time
took twice as long as when they met two years ago for the junior
welterweight title and Chavez was stopped on cuts in the fourth
round.
	   Chavez fought gallantly but took the brunt of De La Hoya's
punches throughout the fight and was well behind on all three
scorecards when his corner called the fight.
	   The fight was a brawl from the early rounds on, as De La Hoya
pressed for the knockout he wanted to gain the respect he claims he
didn't get from Chavez the first time they met.
	   ``You did it. You did it,'' Chavez told De La Hoya as the two
embraced after the fight, finally giving him the respect he wanted.
