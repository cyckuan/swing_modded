<HEADLINE> International Conference on Arming Bosnia Ends with Lukewarm Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
training and arming the Bosnia federal army, or Ankara donors
conference, ended here today with only a donation of 102 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials from 32 countries and five organizations attended the
conference, co-sponsored by Turkey and the United States, aimed at
ensuring that the Bosnian federation is able to defend its people
and territory after the peacekeeping forces withdraw.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some European Union (EU) countries seem at odds
over the "training and equipping" project, which the latter argue
will threaten to undermine the fledging disarmament attempts in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member countries sent only observers to the one-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said that arms control
measures will not in themselves provide defense for the Croat-
Moslem federation or create stability in Bosnia over a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
It noted that security and stability require the creation of a
military balance between the parties in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added that by training and equipping the
Croat-Moslem federation, no action is intended to undermine "the
security of the people and territorial rights of either the
federation or the Serb Republic."
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a peace accord signed in Paris late last
year, Bosnia is divided into a Serb entity and a Moslem-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, various forms of donations to the project
were discussed. They include funding, transportation, training
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
James Pardew, the U.S. Department's special envoy for military
stablization in the Balkans, formally announced a donation worth
100 million dollars to the program.
</P>
<P>
The conference host Turkey promised a two-million-dollar
donation. "Others expressed willingness to make contribution in
the future," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
But some countries, probably EU member nations, "did not wish
to make a contribution at this point."

of African Unity (OAU) Meles Zenawi today praised the U.N.
Special Initiative on Africa as saying that the U.N. initiative
will be greeted by Africa as "a concrete demonstration of the
entire U.N. system's commitment to Africa's development".

<P>

that africa needs to bring about sustainable social and economic
development for its peoples".

own peoples, He noted the international community also has the
responsibility to assist Africa "to overcome the immense
challenges it is facing to prevail over poverty and to create the
impetus for development".
</P>

Commission for Africa (ECA) K.Y.Amoako said the Special
Initiative on Africa "is a great reaffirmation of the United
Nations' role and commitment to working with the leaders, the
policymakers, planners and people of our continent, to equip
africa to meet the challenges of the 21st century ".

<HEADLINE> US Announces 100 Million Dollar Military Contribution to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy James Pardew
announced here today that the U.S. government would contribute
some 100 million U.S. dollars in terms of weapons and other
military equipment to the controversial "train and equip" project
for the Bosnia Federation forces.
</P>
<P>
Pardew, the U.S. special representative for military
stabilization in the Balkans, told a press conference following
the Ankara donors conference for the project that the qualitative
improvements in the relatively weak military forces of the Bosnia
Federation would make the federal army have a "capability for
deterrence and defense by the time the NATO's Implementation Force
(IFOR) withdraws.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, let me emphasize that military stabilization in
Bosnia is not a threat to anyone who seeks lasting peace in
Bosnia-Herzegovina," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton would recommend to the
congress the transfer of U.S. military aid in two lots.
</P>
<P>
The first lot, to be shipped after March 14 in accordance with
the U.N. Security Council resolutions, will consist of light
weapons and non-lethal equipment such as M16 rifles, M60 machine
guns and telephone and radio systems.
</P>
<P>
The second will consist largely of heavy weapon systems like
M113 armored personnel carriers, main battle tanks, light
anti-tank weapons and UH-1 utility helicopters. Delivery of these
items can begin earlier than June 12, 1996, in accordance with
the Dayton accords reached in the U.S. last November.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also pledging 200,000 dollars in non-lethal
International Military Educational Training (IMET) for Bosnia
Federation troops.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Xinhua concerning the
U.S.-Europe row on the armament program, Pardew said, "There are
different views in some circles on how you achieve that (a
military balance in Bosnia), but all of us are working towards a
common goal, a stable military situation."
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. was looking forward to contributing to
not only the "train and equip" project but also the reconstruction
of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries argued at the conference that the
project will threaten to undermine the disarmament attempts in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said last week during an
informal EU ministers meeting in Palermo, Sicily, that he could
not understand why there is money for arms but not for
construction.
</P>
<P>
His view is believed to be echoing that of other European
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese-Israeli Track to Be Activated after Progress on Syrian-Israeli Track: Hariri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al
Hariri has announced that the Lebanese-Israeli track of the peace
negotiations would be activated after "big problems between Syria
and Israel are settled."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram on the eve of
his visit to Cairo, the Lebanese prime minister pointed out that
it is Syria, rather than Lebanon, which is regarded by Israel as
a "strategic danger."
</P>
<P>
To coincide with Hariri's arrival in the Egyptian capital, the
interview, which had been carried out before a "Summit of
Peacemakers" was held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of
Sharm el Sheikh, is to be published in Saturday's issue of
Cairo's Al-Ahram daily
</P>
<P>
Hariri attributed the "slowness" of the peace negotiations
between Lebanon and Israel to the arrangements made by the United
States, which, together with the former Soviet Union, co-sponsored
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He told the semi-official newspaper that Washington wanted
Israel to complete its peace talks first with the Palestinians
and the Jordanians, and then with the Syrians in a view to the
much more complicated problems between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There are problems between Lebanon and Israel, but totally
different," the Lebanese prime minister pointed out, "since
Israel believes that Syria constitutes a strategic security
danger for it, when Lebanon does not constitute a strategic
security danger for Israel."
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Lebanon only as "a problem" for Israel's
security because of the resistance operations against the Israeli
occupation, the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
"The kind of problems between Syria and Israel is totally
different (from that between Lebanon and Israel)," Hariri
concluded. "So we believe that with a settlement of the big
problems between Syria and Israel, it will become natural to
activate the Lebanese-Israeli track before completing the
negotiations with the Syrians."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated an agreement between Lebanon and Syria on the
inseparability and interlocking between the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks.
</P>
<P>
"They will not sign a peace accord before Lebanon and we also
will not sign before them," the Lebanese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the peace talks between Syria and Israel have
advanced and undoubtedly will advance further, but "will not reach
a stage of signature before Lebanese completes its negotiations
with Israel."
</P>
<P>
There is a "full coordination" between Syria and lebanon in
the peace negotiations, and this coordination is in Lebanon's
interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Israel ends its occupation of south Lebanon and
western Bekaa, realization of the peace will have definite
influence upon Lebanon's sovereignty and its independence," Hariri
said.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire-turned prime minister announced that after the
peace, Lebanon will play the role of a "pioneer" in spite of its
small size, because the conflict between the Arabs and Israel
will change from a military conflict to a "conflict in the
economy, civilization and culture."

<HEADLINE> Cooperation between Kenya, China's Jiangsu Province Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) --A senior official of the Kenyan
Ministry of Health today commended the close co-operation between
Kenya and China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the Chinese Jiangsu Province delegation here,
Permanent Secretary of the Kenyan Ministry of Health D. B.
Kimutai said he is happy to meet the delegates from the Chinese
province of Jiangsu which has completed some important projects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three-man delegation led by the Jiangsu Province's Deputy
Governor Wang Rong Bing arrived here yesterday for a four-day
working visit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kimutai cited the upgrading project of the Moi National
Referral and Teaching Hospital at Eldoret Town, which had been
constructed by Jiangsu Province and handed over to the Kenyan
Government last October.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project with a construction area of
21,343 square meters marked the beginning of a new period of the
hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Jiangsu province and the Kenyan
Government, among other projects, are now jointly undertaking the
construction of a medicine-production factory. He hoped that the
co-operation between the two sides will be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province Wang Rong Bing
said, Jiangsu can be understood by Kenyans because she has
undertaken some important projects here.
</P>
<P>
He introduced Jiangsu Province's medical and health appliances
production to D.B. Kimutai and urged the Kenyan Health Ministry
to import its advanced products for cheaper prices and better
quality.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Reduces Layoff Estimates as Business Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The AT&AMP;T Corp., the
telecommunication giant, said today it will lay off about 18,000
people rather than the 30,000 it originally estimated as new
business is emerging.
</P>
<P>
The company announced in January it would remove about 40,000
jobs over the next two years as it splits into three companies.
Later, it said it expected to lay off about 30,000 people as part
of that plan.
</P>
<P>
It estimated about 6,000 employees will get other jobs within
the company. It said as some divisions grow, such as wireless
services and the Worldnet Internet access service, more jobs will
be created.
</P>
<P>
Those factors caused the company to reduce its projections on
the number of jobs to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The company placed full-page ads in 29 newspapers Thursday
seeking jobs for the workers it is laying off.
</P>
<P>
The split will begin next month when its network equipment
business is spun off as an independent company called Lucent
Technologies. The other two companies will be AT&AMP;T, which will
provide communications services, and NCR, a computer division.
</P>
<P>
To take a bigger share of the market, AT&AMP;T announced in
February that it is going to provide low-cost Internet service
starting from March 14.
</P>
<P>
The company held a grand ceremony Thursday at its headquarters
in New Jersey to distribute freely more than 5,000 software needed
for using Internet service. The company has been so swamped with
orders that it has been unable to ship the start-up software to
most of the 212,000 customers who have requested it so far.

<HEADLINE> Action Against Former Barings Executives Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Action is imminent against former
executives of Barings, the merchant bank whose collapse rocked the
City a year ago, according to authoritative sources.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian reported today that the Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA), which polices stockbroking and commodities
trading, has completed a list of those who will be facing
discipline.
</P>
<P>
SFA investigators began inquiries in March last year,
immediately after Barings was brought down by the reckless gambles
of its Singapore-based rogue trader, Nick Leeson.
</P>
<P>
Their report was completed in January, since when it has been
scrutinized by SFA lawyers keen to ensure that disciplinary action
is not open to challenge in the courts.
</P>
<P>
Twelve executives, including former Deputy Chairman Andrew
Tuckey and Peter Norris, former chief executive of investment
banking, were at the heart of the inquiry, which broadened out to
include a lot of present and former Barings management.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that some of the more senior personnel have
ensured they are represented by heavyweight legal advisers, which
has had the effect of delaying the start of any SFA action.
</P>
<P>
But it was reported that a list of those to face disciplinary
hearings has been completed, and that action is imminent, probably
within the next fortnight.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
increased by 1.2 percent in February, the biggest advance in more
than eight years, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the third increase in the last four months and the
biggest gain since it jumped 1.3 percent in October 1987, the Fed
said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also revised the figure of January and said that output
by the nation's factories, utilities and mines in the month was
not as weak as previously thought. The production declined 0.4
percent rather than 0.6 percent as initially announced.
</P>
<P>
After remaining sluggish during much of 1995, industrial
production rose 0.3 percent in November and 0.1 percent in
December, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
In February, the nation's industries were operating at 82.9
percent of capacity, up from 82.1 percent in January. The rate,
which had been as high as 85.1 percent at the beginning of 1995,
suggested a lack of production bottlenecks and little danger of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said that the factory output in February shot up
1.4 percent, the biggest increase since a 1.7 percent advance in
the same month of 1987. Output of durable goods went up by 1.9
percent, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in January. Output
of non-durable goods was also up by 0.8 percent, erasing a 0.6
percent loss a month earlier.

MOGADISHU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A man was stoned to death
today in the Somali town of Jowhar after an Islamic court had
convicted him for raping a 15-year-old girl.

<P>
Mohamed Ali Arran, a 30-year-old husband and father, would

bachelor -- in accordance with the Islamic law in Somalia.
</P>

The family of the rape victim refused to make any out-of-court
agreement with the family of the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
According to an Islamic judge, such crimes could never be
negotiated or solved otherwise than the implementation of the
Islamic laws.
</P>

There have been seven people stoned to death since 1992, when
five women were stoned for prostitution.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Rejects Ireland's Plea for New IRA Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), rejected today the plea voiced by
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton for a fresh IRA cease-fire,
reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Bruton made an emotional speech today in Washington to the IRA,
pleading for restoration of the cease-fire it shattered with a
bomb blast in east London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
But he also pledged that no single issue, such as arms
decommissioning, would be allowed to hold up the planned all-party
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's chairman in Northern Ireland Gerry O'Hara described
Bruton's speech as "very disappointing."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio, O'Hara criticized the Irish
premier for not putting enough pressure on Britain for all-party
talks during the IRA's 17-month truce.
</P>
<P>
He complained that Bruton was not forceful enough. The IRA did
not trust British Prime Minister John Major and now would trust
Bruton less, he added.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Plane-Maker Fokker Declares Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- One of the companies that have
pioneered the world's aviation, the Dutch plane-maker Fokker,
declared itself bankrupt today.
</P>
<P>
According to Dutch radio monitored here, Fokker chairman Van
Schaik said the decision followed the failure to find a buyer
after the majority share-holder Daimler-Benz of Germany cut off
financial support two months ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,664 workers will lose their jobs in the
Netherlands, and several thousand workers will be affected in
other European countries which supplied parts to Fokker.
</P>
<P>
Today's bankruptcy announcement means the 77-year Fokker's
aviation history has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Fokker's international reputation stands from the First World
War, but its production was destroyed in the Second World War
during the German occupation.
</P>
<P>
After the Second World War, the Dutch government, keen to
foster an independent aerospace industry, restarted production.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the going has been increasingly tough for
Fokker. The market of the small jet airliners is overcrowded and
high production costs make it impossible to compete.
</P>
<P>
Despite today's bankruptcy announcement, some of Fokker's
activities including the aircraft maintenance division will
continue in the new Fokker Aviation Company which will have 2,500
employees.
</P>
<P>
The new group will go independently to find a financial or
industrial partner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press today, Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok
called Fokker's bankruptcy "a social drama" for his country and
said that the Dutch government had already done everything it
could to save Fokker's collapse.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today became the sole candidate for the coming
presidential elections slated for March 16 and 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe gained the sole candidacy after the only opposition
candidate, retired bishop Abel Muzorewa of united parties,
withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
Muzorewa's withdrawal was announced minutes after his party's
application for the postponement of the elections was vetoed by
the supreme court today.
</P>
<P>
The other opposition candidate, Ndabaningi Sithole of Zanu
(Ndonga), pulled out on March 12 to protest the alleged
interference into his party's operations by the central
intelligence organ of the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are almost certain that Mugabe would win the
forthcoming presidential election.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Pledging 100 million dollars for training and technical aid
in the struggle against terrorism, President Bill Clinton used his
visit to Israel to convince Israelis the U.S. stands behind the
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
-- Authorities in the small town of Dunblane, Scotland, said
they had been trying to get someone to do something about Thomas
Hamilton, who killed 16 children, their teacher and himself.
</P>
<P>
-- The House approved a trimmed counterterrorism bill, but both
Democratic and Republican leaders predicted it would be hard to
reconcile with a broader measure that sailed through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The head of an alleged Iran-backed terrorist camp in Bosnia
called U.S. concerns "very silly."
</P>
<P>
-- Malcolm S. "Steve" Forbes formally ended his candidacy for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
-- The housing crisis among low-income Americans is worse that
ever, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- GM took steps state by state to block unemployment pay for
the 111,550 UAW workers idled by a 10-day brake-plant strike. The
auto maker is prepared for a strike of two weeks or more, people
close to the matter said, to establish its right to buy parts from
the most competitive bidders. The economic effect shouldn't be
severe if the strike runs only a few weeks, observers said, though
a longer action would become more harmful.
</P>
<P>
-- The House cleared a bill to fund the government through next
Friday, and the Senate has promised to act before spending
authorities expire tonight. Separately, congressional negotiators
agreed on a measure to give the president a line-item veto, which
would be a significant expansion of executive-branch power.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Late payments on credit card debt tied a 10-year high last
quarter, triggering warning belts about the financial health of
the nation's consumers. Delinquencies have risen steadily since
September 1994. They're now as high as they were the last quarter
of the 1990-91 recession, the American Bankers Association says.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 4 ASEAN Nations to Explore "Last Frontier" (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) --
Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area
(BIMP-EAGA) is, perhaps, the "last frontier" of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The region includes Brunei, East and West Kalimantan and North
Sulawesi provinces in Indonesia, Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan in
Malaysia and Mindanao and Palawan in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The EAGA is characterized by abundance of natural resources,
vast forests, oil, gas and coal reserves, and land and water
resources, including a substantial coastal zone.
</P>
<P>
However, due to inadequate physical infrastructure and
available skilled manpower, the dramatic industrialization of the
EAGA countries has only slightly touched the EAGA sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In order to explore the "last frontier" in Southeast Asia,
initialed by President Fidel Ramos, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines launched the EAGA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Being the most recent private sector-led economic grouping in
Southeast Asia, the EAGA has made several in-roads since its
establishment two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.8 billion pesos (312 million US dollars) in investments
were already committed in the Philippine area last year.
Investments were mostly for fisheries and rubber plantations.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day finalization conference, sponsored by the
Asian Development Bank, on the study of the BIMP-EAGA, which
concluded here today, senior officials from the four countries and
experts from the Asian Development Bank proposed a three-phase
development strategy for the EAGA.
</P>
<P>
The first phase dubbed the priority action plan consists of 32
policy and project interventions that are to be implemented in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
The second phase or the medium-term plan, including 80 policy
and project interventions, will consolidate existing development
trends along with further infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
And lastly, the longer-term plan, including 43 policy and
project interventions, hopes to increase the economic impact of
the EAGA to its proximate areas.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez told
reporters that the priority action plan will focus on three
sectors, namely, tourism, agriculture, forestry and fisheries and
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the final report of the study will be presented at
an EAGA senior government officials meeting to be held in Davao
city in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank hopes that the study will formulate
a strategy for increasing the level of economic cooperation among
the EAGA subregion in a bid to enhance the overall economic
development and improve associated social welfare in the EAGA.

<HEADLINE> (Repeat With Correction in Para 5)  US Consumer Prices Up Moderately in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department
reported today that consumer prices in the country edged up a
moderate 0.2 percent in February, half the increase in January.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) also
showed smaller price gains in many of its components and a big
drop in the cost of clothing which fell 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
February's increase was the smallest since an identical advance
in December.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs continued to rise in February, but the 0.4 percent
increase was much smaller than the 1.9 percent increase, led by a
8.8 percent jump of fuel oil costs, in the previous month and the
1.1 percent gain last December. Food prices were up a slight 0.1
percent for the third straight month.
</P>
<P>
The core CPI, excluding the volatile food and energy
components, rose 0.2 percent, down from the 0.3 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
For the first two months of the year, inflation at the consumer
level has been rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. The
February increase would produce an annual rate of just 2.4
percent, even less than last year's 2.5 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The department reported Thursday that wholesale prices fell 0.2
percent in February, the first decline in eight months.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the reports would have raised expectations that
the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for the third
time since December in an attempt to spur the economy. But the
recent economic data, especially the employment figure in
February, has dimmed the hope that the Federal Reserve would cut
the interest rate at the end of this month.

LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than two million Zambians
have registered as voters since the registration started on
December 12, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Joel Sikazwe, the spokesman of the Electoral Commission, said
here today that a total of 2,032,324 people have registered as

to 50 percent of eligible voters had registered.
</P>
<P>
Rabson Mwansa, Director of Election, would give a briefing on
the final figures of the registration in the remaining two
provinces next Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 44 percent of the estimated 4.6 million eligible
Zambian voters have registered in the registration exercise which
has been extended three times due to low turn-out of the voters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said today
that it was confident the adoption of the draft constitution will
not be opposed by the opposition parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman Amusa Mwanamwamba said the two
opposition parties in the parliament would debate the issue
extensively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he warned that if the opposition members of
parliament walked out, MPs of the ruling party would pass the
draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
"They should prepare to debate the matter adequately to gain
support in the parliament. We don't expect them to walk away as
they have done before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party and the government have insisted that the
draft constitution should be passed by the parliament which has
been mandated by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
But some of opposition parties and political organizations
have demanded that the draft constitution be adopted by a
constituent assembly and a national referendum to test its
popularity.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate, which
in January reached its peak of the recent three years, has
started the predicted down, falling 1.6 percentage points in
February.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary published here today, the country's economic
analyst Dataworld said inflation had fallen from 28 percent in
January to 26.4 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Further drop can be expected in March although it is possible
for a rebounce in the second quarter of the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The third quarter, however, will be much more exciting and
inflation can be expected to fall sharply due to the drop in food
prices and high month-on-month inflation increases in the
corresponding period," Dataworld said.
</P>
<P>
He described as dim the prospects of achieving a 17 percent
inflation rate by mid-year in line with fiscal targets agreed
upon between the government and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF, alarmed at the Zimbabwean government's high budget
deficit, wanted the country's inflation brought down before it
could resume disbursement of crucial balance-of-payments aid,
which it suspended in September last year.

<HEADLINE> Computer Theft in Britain Increases 60 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Computer-related theft in Britain
has risen by 60 percent and the cost of computer security failure
to the average firm has almost doubled since 1994, according to a
latest government survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the estimated average immediate cost of
an incident was 16,000 pounds (24,320 U.S. dollars) and that 20
percent of incidents had a serious impact on the organization.
</P>
<P>
In 16 percent of cases, it took more than a week to restore
operations to normal. The largest single breach identified was a
750,000 pound (1.14 million dollar) theft.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 of the 600 respondents had a breach in the past
two years highlighting the problem of chip theft, where the
memories and microprocessors in computers and other pieces of
intelligent electronics were stolen.
</P>
<P>
Ian Taylor, the technology minister, said the survey was a
stark warning to businesses. "Companies need to make more
effective use of information and communications technologies to
improve competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
But "as the use of this technology grows, the information held,
sorted and retrieved electronically becomes an incredibly valuable
business asset," he added.

<P>
LONDON, March 15 (xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and opposition Labor leader Tony Blair jointly visited today the
primary school in Dunblane, central Scotland, where 16 children and
their woman teacher were brutally killed Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, flags flew at half-mast in the
small city and many shops had hand-written signs in their window
expressing their sympathy to the victims and their families.

The school gates were decked with a mountain of toys and
flowers, and the school and the city as a whole are still in great
grief.
</P>
<P>
Major said he hoped the school and the community understood
"the enormous warmth that comes out to them from every part of the
country."

into the school gym and opened fire at the pupils aged four to
six. Sixteen children and their woman teacher were killed and
another 12 children and two teachers were injured, and the whole
country has been terribly shocked by the tragedy .

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down in Sweden, Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Inflation is continuing to
decline in Sweden while neighboring Norway has downgraded its
inflation forecast for 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by Statistics Sweden, the annual
inflation rate in the Nordic country declined to 1.7 percent in
February, the lowest since November 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index increased by only 0.1 percent in
January and February and the trend toward lower prices is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Norway's central bank Thursday downgraded its
forecast for inflation in 1996 to 1.25 percent from its projection
of 2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The bank also lowered its projection for inflation among
Norway's main trading partners. Moderate inflation in the world
contributes to lower inflation in Norway, said the bank.

HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today became the sole candidate for the coming

Muzorewa's withdrawal was announced minutes after his party's
application for the postponement of the elections was vetoed by
the supreme court today.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up Moderately in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department
reported today that consumer prices in the country edged up a
moderate 0.2 percent in February, half the increase in January.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) also
showed smaller price gains in many of its components and a big
drop in the cost of clothing which fell 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
February's increase was the smallest since an identical advance
in December.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs continued to rise in February, but the 0.4 percent
increase was much smaller than the 8.8 percent jump in the
previous month and the 1.1 percent gain in last December. Food
prices were up a slight 0.1 percent for the third straight month.
</P>
<P>
The core CPI, excluding the volatile food and energy
components, rose 0.2 percent, down from the 0.3 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
For the first two months of the year, inflation at the consumer
level has been rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. The
February increase would produce an annual rate of just 2.4
percent, even less than last year's 2.5 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The department reported Thursday that wholesale prices fell 0.2
percent in February, the first decline in eight months.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the reports would have raised expectations that
the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for the third
time since December in an attempt to spur the economy. But the
recent economic data, especially the employment figure in
February, has dimmed the hope that the Federal Reserve would cut
the interest rate at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Major Program to Boost African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations launched here
today a multi-billion dollar program to provide new impetus to
African development over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The program, called the Special Initiative on Africa, concerns
all U.N. agencies and is said to be U.N.'s most significant
mobilization of support for the development of a continent's
people and its largest coordinated action.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony at the U.N. office in Geneva, U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that through the new
initiative, U.N. is sending a message to all African
people: "Africa is not alone, it is not deserted. Africa is now
getting more attention from the world than ever before."
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the United Nations, and the international
community as a whole, to stand together with Africa, its leaders,
and its people...," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation costs estimated at about 25 billion
U.S. dollars over a 10-year period, the U.N. program will devote
its resources to support African development efforts in the
following priority sectors: basic education, health care,
governance, food security, water and sanitation, peace-building
and informatics.
</P>
<P>
The initiative has 14 components for action concentrated in the
above-mentioned priority sectors. For each component, a lead U.N.
agency or several agencies will be responsible for resource
mobilization and coordinating implementation.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the program will conduct a 10-year campaign
to ensure basic education for all African children and expanded
health care at the community level.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage the reduction of Africa's external debt
burden and help lessen Africa's aid dependency by expanding trade
access, diversifying export opportunities and boosting the inflows
of foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The new program will address food issues by promoting the
control of land degradation and desertification, and improvement
in soil quality.
</P>
<P>
It will also ensure the sustainable use of and equitable access
to fresh water in Africa, as well as household water security for
drinking and sanitation for at least 80 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
While the financial resources required for implementation of
the initiative are substantial, financing will come mainly from a
reordering of priorities in African national budgets and
reallocations of existing levels of multilateral and bilateral
official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
As part of the initiative, all heads of U.N. agencies and
organizations are pledged to participate in a year-long effort at
mobilizing political support for Africa's development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Administrative Committee on Coordination, comprising
the heads of all U.N. agencies, will monitor implementation of the
initiative through a steering committee co-chaired by the
administrator of the U.N. Development Program and the executive
secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Launching ceremonies for the Special Initiative on Africa were
held Friday simultaneously at New York, Geneva, Nairobi, Paris and
Rome.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on Palestinian Self-Rule Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The military authorities today
lifted the ban on internal traffic between Palestinian villages in
the West Bank, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The army originally intended to remove the ban only for 12
hours starting early this morning to allow Palestinians to move
from village to village in order to stock up on supplies, but
later announced that the ban will not be reimposed.
</P>
<P>
However, the 19-day ban on Palestinian entry into Israel
remains in force.
</P>
<P>
Workers will be allowed to travel to industrial zones in the
West Bank after they receive permission from the Israeli Civil
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Senior army officers met with the head of Palestinian police
in Ramallah this morning to discuss fight against terrorism and
examine the possibility of lifting the closure of the
territories, which has kept some two million Palestinians under
virtual blockade.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority has set up an emergency committee to
arrange food supplies for the 6,000 residents at al-Fawwar
refugee camp, near Hebron. The camp has been under curfew for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel also intends to gradually allow food and produce to be
transported into the Gaza Strip and West bank, followed by
allowing produce, and later clothing, to be exported from the
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
But observers believe that, in view of the general elections
scheduled for May 29, the government might not completely lift
the closure for fear of renewed suicide attacks.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Peace Talks Impossible Until Syria Restrains Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that peace talks with Syria will be impossible
unless Damascus reins in Hezbollah (Party of God) activities in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in Tel Aviv after their meeting, Peres said
that Israel has already sent a clear message on this issue to
Syria through the Americans.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Peres made such a public comment
connecting Syrian peace negotiations with Hezbollah
activities. Tensions on the Israeli-Lebanese border remain high
after Hezbollah gunmen frequently ambushed Israeli soldiers in
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that he expects a U.S.-Israeli bilateral
agreement on combating terrorism will be signed when Peres visits
the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that under the agreement, the U.S. will
provide Israel with equipment including those of explosive
detection capacity and x-ray. "This will enable Israel to
strengthen border controls and will give us greater protection
against suicide bombers and smuggled explosives," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a U.S. team has already been working with Israeli
security personnel. "We plan to enhance our cooperation to the
research and development of new counter-terrorism
technologies. We also plan to strengthen regional coordination
against terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher, the U.S. intends to convene a
follow-up meeting later this month to this week's Sharm el-Sheikh
summit on promoting the Mideast peace march and combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on European and Asian countries to
reconsider their relations with Iran, which in his words
"continues to fund, train and provide political support for
Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas."
</P>
<P>
He said that these countries should take tougher steps against
Iran to press on it to change its position on the Islamic
extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Christopher and Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) Director John Deutsch, met with Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak and senior security officials to work out details of
the U.S.-Israeli anti-terrorism agreement.
</P>
<P>
Christopher and Deutsch remained in Israel today after
accompanying the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton who left
here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Both Christopher and Deutsch left for Washington later this
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Reacts Mildly to Duma Vote on Reviving Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin today reacted mildly
to the State Duma's vote on restoring the former Soviet Union,
maintaining that the move would have no legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for any 'extreme measures' with regard to the
State Duma's move," an authoritative source in Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's entourage said.
</P>
<P>
The vote would produce no tangible effect apart from causing
irritation among Russia's partners in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma voted 250 to 98 (with no abstentions) earlier today in
favor of declaring null and void the Belevechye agreement which
laid the basis for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the
formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The lower house also approved by 252 to 33 votes (with five
abstentions) a resolution recognizing as legally binding on the
Russian Federation the results of a referendum on March 17, 1991,
on the preservation of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1991, Yeltsin and the then-leaders of Ukraine and
Belarus signed an agreement in Belevechye, Belarus, which
dismantled the Soviet Union and replaced it with the CIS.
</P>
<P>
In an overnight TV interview, Yeltsin said that in the 1991
referendum he himself had voted in favor of preserving the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
But the disintegration of the Soviet Union had been inevitable,
Yeltsin said, adding that "Russia was not the first to proclaim
sovereignty among the 15 former Soviet republics."
</P>
<P>
He warned in the interview that he would "resort to extreme
measures" if the lawmakers vote to restore the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Medvedev said today that the
Duma's vote "is dubious both from a juridical point of view and
from the viewpoint of the interests of millions of Russian
citizens."
</P>
<P>
The Duma's move would only destabilize the political situation
in Russia and undermine the process of integration of the CIS as
well as Russia's reputation in the international arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president is watching closely the developments in the Duma
and will make a statement soon, Medvedev added.
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin source told reporters that Yeltsin, as the guarantor
of the Constitution, would do whatever was necessary to preserve
the present constitutional system.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Tax evasion by businesses has
become an increasingly serious problem in Vietnam, a recent
investigation by tax authorities has shown.
</P>
<P>
In investigations of 497 state-owned enterprises, 278 private
firms and 65 joint ventures, authorities discovered tax defaults
of 868.9 billion Vietnamese dong (about 79 million U.S. dollars)
and evaded taxes amounting to 87.6 billion dong (17 million
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said tax evasion is particularly serious in the
entertainment industry and the import-export business.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports pointed to loopholes in the taxation
system, extensive tax deductions and inefficient tax collection as
the primary causes of the problem.
</P>
<P>
They called for tougher government regulations against
corporate tax evasion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al
Hariri expressed his belief here today that Syria will not sign a
peace agreement with Israel before Lebanon does the same.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the peace talks between Syria and Israel "will not
reach the stage of signature before Lebanon ends its negotiations"
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Arabic language daily
"Al-Ahram" on the eve of his departure for Cairo to attend a
meeting of the Lebanese-Egyptian Higher Council, Hariri stressed
a "full coordination" between Lebanon and Syria in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The interview will be published in Al-Ahram on Saturday morning
to coincide with the arrival of the Lebanese prime minister in the
Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at the very mement when Israel's occupation in
south Lebanon and western Beqaa is ended, "peace will have a
definite influence on Lebanon's sovereignty and independence."
</P>
<P>
Hariri predicted that Lebanon will play a role of "pioneer"
after the achievement of peace in the region in spite of its size.
</P>
<P>
"After the end of the military conflict with Israel," the
billionaire-turned prime minister emphasized, "there will be an
economic, civilizational and cultural conflict."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that his visit to Egypt on Saturday will
result in an enhancement of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the parliamentary elections in Lebanon later this year, the
prime minister said his government is working to map out a new
electional law in order to send it to the parliament before the
middle of next month at most for an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would not draft a law which
could receive an opposition from a large proportion of the
Lebanese people.

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament President
Klaus Haensch warned today that without "sincere reforms," the
European Union will no longer exist in a matter of years.
</P>
<P>
In an article published today in Belgium's largest newspaper,
Le Soir, Haensch said the "only way" to check rising skepticism
over European integration is to make a success of the EU
Inter-Governmental Conference, scheduled to start on March 29 in
Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament is a supervisory and advisory organ of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Turin conference aims to revise the Maastricht Treaty on EU
monetary and political union and draw up structural reform plans
to push forward European integration.
</P>
<P>
Haensch said that the addition to the Maastricht Treaty of a
clause on making the fight against unemployment an EU priority
would be a major step forward.
</P>
<P>
He called for flexibility in abiding by the standards
stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He also said that more structural reforms are needed before the
15-nation EU grants membership to Eastern European nations.

MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The proposed Import-Export Bank
(Eximbank), aimed at enhancing the Philippines' exports, will
start its operation in August.
</P>
<P>
Philexport President Jose Luis Ortiz said today local exporters
have already raised the 1.25 billion pesos (50 million US dollars)
needed for its full force operation.
</P>

The Indonesia-based Lippo Group of companies has contributed
some 30 percent of the needed fund. The remaining amount was
provided by more than 200 local firms.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the Eximbank was proposed in a bid to provide

<P>
financial access of small and medium-sized enterprises, which
are either in exportation or importation of their
products.
</P>
<P>
the Philippines' total export last year reached more than 12.8

<HEADLINE> United States Sweeps Four-nation Women's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NIGNBO, Southeast China, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States
had a sweep clean of all titles in the three legs of the
four-nation women's basketball tournament after nipping hosts
China here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The American women, third place finishers at the World
Championship last year, handed a 84-77 defeat to their Chinese
counterparts, runners-up both in the 1992 Olympics and 1994 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
The unstoppable Americans won the first two legs of the
tournament early this month, twice beating the Chinese into second
place in Haikou and Zengcheng respectively.
</P>
<P>
China finished third with one victory against two losses in the
round robins at the third leg while Cuba placed second after
routing South Korea 88-68 for a 2-1 record on Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, winless in the tournament, came fourth.
</P>
<P>
The American players led all the way to overcome their Chinese
rivals, who looked nervous most of time and made quite a few
errors in fast attacks.
</P>
<P>
With better individual skills and teamwork, the Americans
opened the game with a 9-1 run and widened the lead to 51-37 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese came back strongly in the second half and cut the
gap to five points with only 15 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
American guard Carla Mcghee then hit two foul shots to seal the
victory.
</P>
<P>
"We played brilliantly in the final minutes," said Chinese head
coach Chen Daohong. "But it was too late."
</P>
<P>
Chinese 2.04-meter center Zheng Haixia hit a game-high 33
points. Liang Xin contributed 14 points and Ma Zongqing added 11.
</P>
<P>
Katrina Mcclain was the top American scorer with 29 points.
She was followed by Rurnie Bolton in 18 and Lisa Leslie in 13.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, fourth-place finishers at the Olympics, dominated the
court throughout the day's other game while South Korea failed to
find their touch.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban hoopers jumped to a flying start with a 30-13 run as
they easily ripped the South Korean defense. They kept an
over-10-points leading margin to leave the court 51-34 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Cuba didn't give any chance to South Korea,
who are famed for tenacity and come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans grabbed most of the rebounds and had much better
goal percentage to pull away, and finally beat their rivals by 20
points.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Vote for Restoring Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house of
the Russian Parliament, today voted in favor of declaring null and
void a 1991 parliament decision that laid the basis for the
dissolution of the former Soviet Union, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved by 250 votes to 98, was initiated by
Communist Party deputies who form the largest single faction in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In an overnight interview with Russian Television, President
Boris Yeltsin warned that he would "resort to extreme measures" if
the Duma votes to restore the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Duma today also approved a resolution recognizing as
legally binding on the Russian Federation the results of a
referendum on March 17, 1991, on the preservation of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The results of the referendum showed that a majority of the
population were in favor of preserving the Soviet Union. Yeltsin
said in the TV interview that he himself had voted in favor of
preserving the Union.
</P>
<P>
However, on December 12, 1991, Yeltsin and the then-leaders of
Belarus and Ukraine signed in Belevezhye, Belarus, an agreement
dismantling the Soviet Union and replacing it with the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has accused the communists of using the restoration of
the Soviet Union as a campaign ploy to win votes in Russia's June
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> GM Shortlists 3 Areas in Philippines for Car Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- US automobile giant General Motors
Corp. (GM) has shortlisted three areas on Luzon Island, the
Philippines, for the site of its proposed Asian manufacturing base
as Manila strengthens its bid to snare the one-billion-US-dollar
project.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar said today,
"We are still in the running."
</P>
<P>
He said the Calabarzon Industrial Area is one of the three
preferred sites.
</P>
<P>
The other two strong contenders are a former Vietnamese refugee
center in Bataan province and a proposed site in Alaminos,
Pangasinan, where Malaysia's Proton Berhad Company has established
a manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
The GM, which currently has a five percent share of the
regional market for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, aims
to supply about 10 percent of the estimated demand of 16 million
vehicles in the region by 2005.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its foothold, the GM plans to set up a regional
manufacturing base either in Thailand or in the Philippines in
addition to its assembly plants in Australia, China, Indonesia and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The proposed facility will require up to one billion US dollars
in investment and will assemble 180,000 cars a year, with some 80
percent to be exported to neighboring Asian countries.

KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed
recently when police opened fire to armed criminals in a village
of Western Nepal's Rukum district, a Home Ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred Tuesday when a team of policemen were
attacked by about 15 armed persons engaged in criminal activities
in the hilly village, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The police team was sent to the village after criminal
activities there were reported and they were forced to open fire
in self-defense as these criminals attacked them with guns and
khukhuri (traditional Nepali knife), according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Draft Laws under Debate by NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Formulation of a law on
administrative punishment and amendments to the Criminal
Procedural Law represent a major step forward in the development
of a better legal system in China, say many deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) in session here.
</P>
<P>
A law on administrative punishment and amendments to the
Criminal Procedural Law are also of realistic significance to wipe
out malpractices inside governmental and judicial bodies, they say
when deliberating on the two draft laws at panel discussions.
</P>
<P>
The draft law and the amendments clearly define the scope of
penalties, procedures to go by when meting out penalties, and
supervision mechanisms for administrative and judicial bodies,
they say.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are of the view that this will better protect the
rights and interests of citizens.
</P>
<P>
Wang Siquan from Beijing says a vendor selling breakfast in the
street may face penalties from government agencies in charge
respectively of prices, taxes, transportation, vaccination,
environmental protection, and industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, these agencies may come to the vendor at the
same time to levy fines, or let him go.
</P>
<P>
A law on administrative punishment may prevent government
agencies to collect fines for their own benefits, and it can also
avoid lax law-enforcement, says Wang, who is also vice-mayor of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hu Dapeng, a former vice-chairman of the National Association
of the Self-Employed, said it is "really great" for the draft law
on administrative punishment to stipulate that relevant government
agencies must give explanations and show evidences for imposing
major penalties such as revoking a business license, and that
fines shall be handed to state coffers.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yazhou, a Zhejiang deputy, said that revision of the
16-year-old Criminal Procedural Law is necessary as the social and
economic situation in China has undergone dramatic changes in the
past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments strengthen checks and balances among
law-enforcement departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Weixin and several other deputies from Guangdong said that
the draft amendments are an improvement of the existing law. The
amendments, for instance, have abolished unsupervised detention of
suspects for investigation by the police, conviction with
exemption from prosecution by the prosecutor, and allowing
defendants to have access to lawyers at a much earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Those stipulations represent a marked progress in the
formulation of a democratic legal system in China, they say.
</P>
<P>
Deputies have also raised many proposals on revising the draft
law and the amendments.
</P>
<P>
The draft Law on Administrative Punishment should have
stipulations on strict law-enforcement and the necessity of
training for law-enforcers before they assume their posts, say
Ding Wei and other six deputies from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting departments should also be supervised by other
organizations when they directly handle corruption cases, a deputy
from Shanxi says.

from the evils of transnational terrorism."
</P>
<P>

combat terrorism through greater vigilance, by denying terrorists
all and every means of succor and support, and by bringing every
terrorist to the bar of justice."
</P>
<P>

activities that have threatened to disrupt the peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Navigation Facilities on Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China is set to invest five billion
yuan in the last five years of the century to speed up
construction of navigation facilities on the Yangtze River, the
third largest river in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the country's important strategic measures for
economic development in the river valley, and means a large
investment opportunity for overseas investors," said an official
with the Yangtze River navigation administrative department under
the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Chinese government worked out a strategy of
developing and opening areas along the river, Shanghai, Jiangsu,
Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan have been enjoying strong economic
growth and an economic zone is taking shape rapidly.
</P>
<P>
However, vigorous economic development along the river valley
is putting pressure on navigation. Only one-tenth of the river's
navigation capacity has been tapped, far below the river's
capacity, which is equal almost to the carrying capacity of 40
railways.
</P>
<P>
The Communications Ministry official said that the five billion
yuan in investment will be mainly used for renovations in the main
channel, modernizing port facilities along the channel, and
construction of container wharves and a number of foreign trade
wharves.

BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Asia-Pacific Urban
Forum here today called for the governments of the countries in
the Asia-Pacific region to show concerns over poor people living

</P>
<P>
The forum stressed that poor urban inhabitants should have
access to education and information in order to create awareness
of choices and opportunities, according to a press release from
the Bangkok-based Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"Urban policies should recognize and respect poor people as
economic and social asset and not merely as a liability," the
forum noted as the week-long event drew to a close today.
</P>
<P>
Resources and financial supports should be available to poor
urban people for the development of livelihood and income
generating opportunities, the forum added.
</P>
<P>
The forum also urged the governments of Asia-Pacific countries
to be more responsive to people's real concerns for their cities.
</P>
<P>
"Cities had become increasingly important in the economic
development of nations and in the new global economy," the forum
said.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century is "the century of cities" and it would
complete the transformation of mankind from a predominantly rural
subsistence society to "a new, technologically dependent, spatial
society", it said.
</P>
<P>
The forum has worked out a document on different aspects of
city life, which will be presented to a United Nations conference
on human settlements scheduled for June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Policy For Child-Bearing Women Welcomed Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A new insurance policy for
Chinese mums-to-be has been welcomed by most city residents.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labour carried out a survey in four cities, and
almost half of the people questioned expressed satisfaction with
the insurance for child-bearing women, the "Chinese Women's News"
reported.
</P>
<P>
China first tried out a program to protect the rights of the
child-bearing career women in 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 522 cities and counties across the country
have offered this insurance policy in enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Funds for women for childbirth, raised from society, reduced
the burden of enterprises, which helped them recruit more women
workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, women who have benefited from the insurance policies
have more opportunities to step out from families and contribute
more to society, the paper siad.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Labour, another 35 large and
medium cities plan to provide the insurance before 1997, and 80
percent of the cities and counties nationwide intend to carry out
the program by the end of this century.

LISBON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian World Cup midfielder
Erwin Sanchez, who plays for Boavista club in Portugal, was
suspended on Friday for doping and could be banned for six to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will remain in force until the Portuguese
Football Federation hears an appeal by the first division club on
the player's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez tested positive for more than the permitted amount of
caffeine in a test following his side's 2-1 away win over
Belenense on January 13.
</P>
<P>
But Boavista claimed the caffeine came from three bottles of
cola the 26-year-old player drank after being replaced in the
78th minute of the match.
</P>
<P>
The test was subsequently confirmed by the second urine sample
examination.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, an idol to Bolivian football fans, protested his
innocence at a news conference at Boavista's headquarters in Porto.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought anything like this could happen to me because
it goes against all my principles," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese troops to be stationed in
Hong Kong after its return to China will take the region's
stability and prosperity as its responsibility, a senior military
leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Military Commission of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the
remark at a meeting of Guangdong deputies to the National People's
Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said China's
central civilian and military authorities have set high standards
for the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after China resumes
sovereignty over the region on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The troops consist of the cream of China's field, naval and air
forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu assured Hong Kong people that the troops, keeping the
People's Liberation Army's tradition of being devoted to the
people, will not encroach upon any interests of Hong Kong people
by strictly abiding by military disciplines, laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Liu also spoke highly of Guangdong's economic achievements made
since China adopted its reform and open policy 17 years ago, which
he said "testifies to the correctness of Deng Xiaoping's theories
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and has
provided good experience for other parts of the country."
</P>
<P>
Liu emphasized the importance of cultural and ideological
progress as the country develops its economy.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay equal attention to economic development and
progress in ethics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged hard work to realize the country's economic
development goals for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"With goals to strive for clearly defined and with guidelines
and policies decided, what is needed now is hard work," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A tire factory in north China's
Hebei Province will have to spend an extra 10 million yuan to
alter an expansion project to avoid damaging cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
In checking the site of the expansion project in Xingtai City,
local archaeologists discovered some prehistoric remains and a
ducal tomb of the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-771 BC).
</P>
<P>
This is just one of the many instances of Hebei's working to
protect cultural relics during its period of rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 400 historical sites that are under
state or provincial protection.
</P>
<P>
To conserve cultural relics, the provincial government has
asked government employees at all levels to become familiar with
Chinese history so that they can deal with the conflict between
cultural relics protection and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Checks are now done before any construction work in the
province is allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics, the major problem in conservation of cultural relics today
is that many local officials are willing to sacrifice cultural
relics for rapid economic development.

of the two countries.

in China's reforms and opening-up, and the aim of the current

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Government Moves to Tame Deficit  (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government started a new
move to tame the country's spiraling current account deficit as it
approved an anti-deficit package proposed by the Finance Ministry
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-point plan passed at a regular cabinet meeting,
the government will cut down tariffs on imports of capital goods,
curb short-term capital inflows and seek to achieve a greater
surplus in its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will strive to promote its trade in
services and establish a system to reduce Thai tourists' spending
overseas in accordance with the plan.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa ordered
the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank to report to him every
month on their anti-deficit progress.
</P>
<P>
The move illustrated the government's concern over the
deficit's potential negative impact on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account deficit climbed to 335.7 billion
baht (13.4 billion US dollars) in 1995, accounting for 8.1 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 40.2 billion baht (1.6
billion US dollars) more than the Central Bank's projection.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Thailand's rising deficit was mainly caused by
increasing foreign capital inflows and imports of machinery for
infrastructure projects and industrial expansion.
</P>
<P>
Huge shipping costs and increased imports of luxury cars and
commercial planes also contributed to the high deficit last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the prime minister's order, officials at the Finance
Ministry and the Thai Central Bank are working on details to carry
out the plan to fight the untamed deficit.
</P>
<P>
Tax measures are being considered to slow down inflows of
short-term foreign capital, like bills of exchanges and
Euro-convertible debentures, which have become hot debt notes for
foreigners to profit from the differences in interest rates
between local and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has required commercial banks and finance
companies to set aside cash reserves of seven percent of
non-resident baht deposits and promissory notes to curb
foreigners' profit-taking from short-term debt notes.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Customs Department is tightening customs procedures on
duty-free items to prevent lavish spending by Thai travelers
aboard, while the Tourism Authority is encouraging purchase in
domestic duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
The government has worked out a plan, including duty exemptions
on purchase of large cargo vessels, to help establish Thailand's
own national merchant fleet to ease its dependence on
foreign-owned vessels.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's spending on freight costs, some 160 billion baht
(6.4 billion US dollars) per year, is also a major contributor to
its current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Thai cabinet ordered the raising of
duties on imports of completely-built cars, especially luxury
ones, among its many new measures to contain the current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, the high deficit is a long-standing problem of
Thailand. Results were unclear from the anti-deficit measures of
previous Thai governments while the current government's new move
will also take time to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Some banking and financial institutions said that more
comprehensive efforts were needed to win the battle against
Thailand's current account deficit.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Official Stresses Ties with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting New Zealand
Minister of Trade Negotiation Philip Burdon said here today his
country considered its relationship with Malaysia as very
important.
</P>
<P>
Burdon, now in Kuala Lumpur for a one-day visit, told the press
that Malaysia was New Zealand's largest export market in Southeast
Asia and the second largest source of imports in the region after
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, New Zealand's export to Malaysia stood at 673 million
Malaysian ringgit (about 269 million US dollars) while its import
from Malaysia amounted to 395 million ringgit (about 158 million
US dollars), said Burdon.
</P>
<P>
He noted although the trade balance was in New Zealand's favor,
import from Malaysia has been increasing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also the second largest Southeast Asian investor in
New Zealand, Burdon said.
</P>
<P>
"We will welcome more investment from Malaysian companies and
individuals in areas of mutual interest," he said at a meeting
with local businessmen here today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and New Zealand have a long history of
people-to-people contact and have developed close cooperation in
various fields, including military training and education.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's military training cooperation with Malaysia is
the second largest after its cooperation with Australia. The
three countries together with Britain and Singapore are members of
a five-power defense arrangement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 13,000 Malaysian students have been
educated in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to start
a four-day official visit to New Zealand on March 25. He last
visited the country in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Burdon stressed that his country is looking forward to
Mahathir's visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's carpet exports,
after a slump due to child labor propaganda, have again started
picking up rapidly, said an official.
</P>
<P>
Figures for the last eight months showed orders worth six
billion rupees (about 176 million US dollars) were either
completed or in the pipeline, said Javed Khan, chairman of Carpet
Exhibition '96, in Lahore today.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 leading carpet importers and delegates from abroad
have been invited to attend the carpet show, which was opened by
Minister of Commerce Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar today.
</P>
<P>
Javed Khan said that carpet exports from the Punjab provincial
capital of Lahore have exceeded four billion rupees (about 117
million US dollars) and by the end of the year a targeted export
worth 10 billion rupees (about 294 million dollars) is expected to
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Latif Malik, chairman of the Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (PCMEA), said the present rising trend in
carpet exports has been infused partly by devaluation of the
Pakistani rupee and partly because the pall of child labor
propaganda has been lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading universities have
been pressurized to train more high-level talented personnel for
an expected economic takeoff in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Senior faculty members of these universities, who are attending
the ongoing annual session of the National People's Congress
(NPC), the country's legislature, promised to redouble their
efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Without qualified college graduates, the national goal of
doubling the 1980 gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2000
and doubling that of 2000 by the year 2010 can hardly be scored,
said Mu Guoguang, president of Nankai University in north China's
port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
He called for the prime importance to be given to the education
of college students who are to be recruited this year, as they
will graduate in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In our trans-century economic development, we must rely on
ourselves to train high-level talented personnel in an effort to
resolve major economic and technical problems," Wu Guoguang said,
urging the authorities to guarantee financial input in major
universities.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing, president of the prestigious Beijing University,
said that new demands have been set for the competence of the
senior talented personnel with the arrival of a high tide in
the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing University will increase its enrolment of
Ph. D students and improve their quality as part of its effort to
rank itself among the first-rated universities in the world.
</P>
<P>
The combined number of postgraduates and Ph. D students, which
will, rising from the present 400 each year to some 1,000 annually
in the years ahead, match the number of its undergraduates, or one
to one, namely, 10,000 to 10,000, Wu envisaged.
</P>
<P>
Li Jijun, president of the Resources and Environment College
of Lanzhou University, in northwestern Gansu Province, called for
an increased financial input into major universities in the
northwest, since China has pledged to attach importance to
economic growth in the central and western regions and formulate
the policies that are aimed at drawing more talents, ranging from
academics and professors to doctors and college graduates.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, only two of the 50-strong PH. d
graduates from the university last year stay to work in Lanzhou,
whereas others have either gone overseas or to work in the
developed areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
Li Daqian, president of the Graduates College of Fudan
University in Shanghai, said that Fudan will neither enlarge
enrolment nor increase the curricula before the year 2000.
Instead, it will give priority to improvement of educational
quality and raising of research levels, Li said.

CHANGCHUN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Province, one of the country's major wildlife habitats, has had to
deal with nearly 1,200 cases of poaching and dealing in wild
animals in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
In the process, it has confiscated 617 guns and 349 tons of
animals or animal parts and levied 610,000 yuan in fines.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has tried to educate people about wild animal protection
since 1982, and as a result, local people have helped to save
2,200 wild animals from poachers.
</P>
<P>
The province has also designated seven natural reserves
covering an area of 1.55 million hectares, in which hunting of
wild animals is banned for the next five years, starting March 1,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The breeding of wild animals is also encouraged, and Jilin has

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in this capital of
south China's Guangdong Province have explained that some 2,000 sq
m of a suburban field that sank was caused by the collapsing of
the top of a cave.
</P>
<P>
The field sank in the middle of the night of February 26 in a
vegetable field, leaving part of the field two meters lower and
resembling a pool.
</P>
<P>
After examining the site, scientists said that the substratum
of the area was limestone containing a lot of caves.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the amount of rain for the four months up to
last February caused the underground water level to drop, leaving
the caves empty.
</P>
<P>
Then heavy rains followed, leaving the earth too heavy for the
emptied cave to support, until it collapsed under the load.

CHENGDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Provincial capital, Chengdu, employed 156,000 more people in the
past five years, some 7,710 more than the previous five years,
thanks to improvement of local employment system.
</P>
<P>
The city's unemployment rate has been kept within two percent,
lower than the average provincial and national level.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the city had over 120 job agencies, which
helped 300,000 people find jobs in the province, and another
57,000 work outside the province in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Job opportunities have been diversified. Statistics have shown
that new employees account for 20.4 percent of the total in
state-run enterprises, 29.1 percent lower than in 1991, while in
other kinds of enterprises, the rate of new employees increased
from 51.5 percent in 1991, to 79.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city reformed its employment security
system. Now more than 900,000 employees from 5,000 local
enterprises have bought policies for employment security, and the
city has paid 15.6 million yuan to 7,700 unemployed people, and
17,000 low-paid workers. The city also offered job training to

<HEADLINE> Mainland Offers Help To Taiwan on Nuclear Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature today offered
to help Taiwan solve its nuclear waste problem and hoped to
increase exchanges and cooperation with the island on the issue of
environmental protection and natural resources conservation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jike, vice chairman of the Environmental and Natural
Resources Protection Committee (ENRPC) of the National People's
Congress (NPC), told a press conference today that Taiwan's
nuclear waste problem can be solved as long as Taiwan returns to
the motherland in the framework of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan is part of China, the spent fuel of its nuclear
power plants is allowed to be transferred to the mainland for
after-treatment, Yang explained at the press conference in the
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
China, a signatory to an international convention prohibiting
the shipment of dangerous wastes from one country to another for
treatment, has rejected requests from a couple of foreign
countries in this regard, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The country is now building three low-to-medium-level storage
pools for spent fuel -- one in northwest China to be operational
next year, one in south China to be completed in 1998 and the
other in east China to be ready in 2002, Yang said. He refused to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Two nuclear power plants, in Qinshan, Zhejiang province, and in
Daya Bay, near Hong Kong, are in operation on the mainland. China
is planning to build more nuclear power plants in coastal regions
where energy shortage is persistent.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of NPC's ENRPC, said there have been many
exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
straits, which he said should continue and develop, and achieve
better results.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Taiwanese people to invest in the mainland and
cooperate with mainlanders in curbing pollution and conserving
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Said Lin Zongtang, ENRPC vice chairman: "We hope Taiwanese
friends would not bring in pollution with their investments on the
mainland."

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 15 (Xinhua) -- First Prime Minister Norodom
Ranariddh hinted Thursday that Cambodia would resort to the use of
force if its border dispute with Vietnam could not be resolved by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia and Vietnam should respect each other's national
sovereignty in accordance with a joint communique signed by their
prime ministers in January 1995, Ranariddh told a mass rally
during an inspection tour of the eastern province of Svay Rieng
which borders Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam has not only violated Cambodian soil, but also the
agreement it signed with Cambodia," said the first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the armed forces and police would defend Cambodian
territory if the border dispute could not be settled through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The dispute began last December when Vietnamese villagers
reportedly entered Cambodian territory to farm in the eastern
provinces of Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng and Takeo.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Runoff Starts In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The second round of general
election got off in Sierra Leone today at a slow start without
many voters turning up at the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
But observers predict that a large turnout is expected in the
capital by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the general election ended without a clear
winner because none of the presidential candidates won the 55
percent of the votes needed to get the post of the civilian
president.
</P>
<P>
The security forces of the military government have mounted
what is called "a security dragnet" in Freetown with armed
soldiers parading the main streets.
</P>
<P>
They are also patrolling in the country's second city of Bo.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is not clear in other parts of the West
African state where the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel
forces, who have refused to take part in the poll, continue
fighting the five-year war.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has made it clear that it will not negotiate with any
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of voters have protested to the Interim
Electoral Commission (INEC) today because their names did not
appear in the electoral lists of the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
"We voted during the first round of the poll on February 26
and 27, but now we are excluded," said Fatmatta Koroma, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the military leaders are eager to hand over to a
civilian leader "as soon as possible" because many of them have
been promised visa entries to the United States for further
studies, if there is a "smooth transition" to democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> West China to Become Magnet for 21st Century Gold Diggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's gold-diggers are to head
west as part of the country's plans to cash in on its mountains of
gold.
</P>
<P>
Within twelve years the western part of China is expected to
become an important gold production base, an official with China's
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The focus of gold development is to be shifted in the Ninth
Five-year Plan period (1996-2000), according to a report by the
"China Geology and Mineral Resources News".
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, by the end of 1994, the
western part, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou and
Sichuan provinces and Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions,
had 22 percent of the country's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the establishment of a number of standard
gold mines, gold production in those areas has increased rapidly,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that, triggered by the government policy to
shift the development focus from the east to the central and
western parts, the conditions for large-scale development of gold
resources in the west have become basically ripe.
</P>
<P>
Several provincial or autonomous regional governments in the
west are formulating policies to support gold enterprises to beef
up development of the rare resource, the newspaper said.

CHONGQING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The age of new technology has
finally caught up with marital bliss in China.
</P>
<P>
Wedding gifts traditionally include tea sets, cooking utensils
and ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Now computers are high on the list of wedding presents as a new
wave of computer fever sweeps China.
</P>
<P>
One newly married couple went to a computer shop in Chongqing,
the largest city in southwest China to collect an 11,000 yuan
latest-model computer. It was a gift to the happy couple from the
mother of bride Wang Xiaoli.
</P>
<P>
Computers, once regarded as a virtually unused "offering" in
scientific research institutions a decade ago, has become a
necessity for more and more Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"China is in a second fever of computer popularization," said
Tan Haoqiang, a noted computer expert.
</P>
<P>
Tan, deputy president of the Beijing Automation Engineering
Institution, disclosed that the first fever took place in the
1980s, when more than one million viewers watched his lectures on
the general knowledge of computer via TV.
</P>
<P>
Almost nine million people bought copies of his book -- "BASIC
Language of Computer".
</P>
<P>
"People have come to see that computers are a good helping hand
in daily life, as well as in work, study and business," Tan added.
</P>
<P>
To help people to master computer knowledge, radio and TV
stations have offered special programs. Newspapers and magazines
have launched special columns, and computer training courses are
mushrooming across the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that the "Computer News" in Chongqing has
developed into the largest professional journal specializing in
computers since it first appeared in 1992. It's sales have been
increasing annually by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government of Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, has
issued a stipulation demanding all government staff members under
50 years old must learn general computer knowledge, and the
government of Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province, has chosen 72
computer teaching centers specially for the training of its
employees.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 people in Shanghai have sat regular computer
tests, and the number of families owning computers in Chongqing
has risen to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
Computer know-how is being taught in many primary schools in
urban areas nowadays.
</P>
<P>
A recent computer and software exhibition in Beijing attracted
90,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese who masters computer knowledge today will have got
a pass into the next century, when most of the work is done by the
computer," a sociologist said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey reveals that about 40 percent of consumers
surveyed in China prefer buying computers rather than telephones,
large screen color televisions or acoustics systems.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has about 8,000 computer enterprises
employing 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Last year over one million computers were sold in China to
private buyers, up 44.4 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the National Information Center predicted that
China will become the world's largest market for private computer
sales in the coming decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Buffalo breeding has helped put
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on the
international map.
</P>
<P>
The region has not only emerged as China's largest fine-breed
buffalo production base, but its cattle have won international
awards.
</P>
<P>
The success is attributed to the research by the Guangxi
Institute of Buffalo under the Chinese Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
The institute, set up in 1994, has conducted buffalo breeding
research in recent years by introducing fine breeds from countries
like India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The institute has made research findings in fertilization,
storage of semen under low temperatures and cross breeding of fine
breeds. It has selected fine breed buffalo that can produce 2,100
kg of milk each and 40 percent of net meat.
</P>
<P>
So far, the region has bred over 1,200 heads of fine buffalo,
and has exported more than 600 heads to other parts of China. The
region has been listed among China's major bases for breeding
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The region has also conducted exchanges with other countries,
and has gained some international awards.

<HEADLINE> International Consumers Rights Day Marked in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- In a show of determination to
protect consumers rights, China today staged events to mark
"International Consumers Rights Day".
</P>
<P>
China Central Television Station broadcast a live special prime
time program this evening, highlighting consumer law.
</P>
<P>
The program was an attempt to enhance the sense of
self-protection by means of law for consumers all over China.
</P>
<P>
The program featured reports on hot consumer topics, art
performances publicizing China's law on the protection of
consumers rights, on-the-spot promulgation of consumers
legislative documents, and the announcement of results of
examinations of suspected fake commodities.
</P>
<P>
Today, thousands of workers in over 2,600 consumers association
offices at county-level have taken to the streets, answering
consumers' questions and dealing with claims on counterfeit
goods. The activity has also drawn favorable responses from
manufacturers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, thousands of consumers from across the country
headed for "Consumers Consultancy Street", and did shopping in the
100 large State-owned department stores and 1,000 trading fairs
which have promised to ban fake goods.
</P>
<P>
In its response to the event, "People's Daily" -- the leading
national newspaper -- recently held a large-scale consumers
enquiry covering six categories of China-made commodities,
including electrical home appliances, daily-use chemicals,
foodstuffs, tonics, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the
government market-watch-dog, exposed ten major cases harming
consumers' rights through mass media coverage.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the London-based Consumer International, China
has commemorated the International Consumers Day eight times.
</P>
<P>
While the Law on the Protection of Consumers Rights, passed two
years ago, has helped enhance the consumers awareness for
self-protection, consumers' associations across the country dealt
with 446,761 consumer claims, and the administrative organs
handled over 67,000 such cases last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Wants More People to Know Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said that
the Basic Law of Macao should be known by more people in
Macao as well as in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, said
that the Basic Law of Macao is not only the legal guarantee of the
interests of Macao residents after 1999, it is also the guideline
for transitional affairs before 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The law will help guarantee the common prosperity and
stability of both Macao and the mainland, and should be known by
more people in Macao and the mainland," Wang told a news
delegation from south China's Guangdong Province Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
He said the law serves as the constitutional law of Macao, and
is a legal guarantee of the realization of the idea of "one
country, two system" and of the long-term stability and prosperity
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he stressed that to achieve a peaceful transition
of Macao, both Portugal and China should make efforts according to
the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we also need the participation from all
parties of Macao in the transitional affairs of Macao, which
should be based on principles in accordance with the law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to the Chinese exercise of sovereignty in
less than four years, and become a special administrative region.
Its capitalist system and basic life style will remain unchanged
for 50 years, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the law should also become familiar to
more people in China's mainland as it is a law of China. People
in different regions or departments should all abide by the law in
handling the affairs related to Macao.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Issues Statement on Solution  of Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A presidential reference may be
made to the appellate division of the Supreme Court to seek its
opinion on the formation of a neutral caretaker government
provided all the parties agreed, Bangladeshi President Abdur
Rahman Biswas said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on his recent initiative for dialogue to resolve
the country's political crisis, the president said that from a
thorough study of the Constitution and the opinions received from
various legal experts, "It appears that the president has his
limitations and that the Constitution is required to be amended to
accommodate the provision for the formation of a neutral caretaker
government followed by a countrywide referendum."
</P>
<P>
"National consensus cannot be reached unless the concerned
parties show more flexibility in their respective positions," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the
opposition have long been locked in dispute over the formation of
a neutral caretaker government to supervise general elections.
Although the BNP has accepted the idea after the February 15 polls
held by itself and some small parties despite the boycott by all
opposition parties, it has kept the position that a bill on the
caretaker government must be passed at the first session of the
newly-elected sixth parliament.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have demanded for the cancellation of
the February 15 polls, resignation of the BNP government and
holding of the fresh sixth parliamentary elections under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his recent discussions with different parties and
legal experts, the president said that the ruling party has
accepted the main demands of the opposition and what remains to be
sorted out now is to implement the formation of a caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
Hoping everybody respects and abides by the law of the land and
the Constitution, Biswas appealed to all political parties to show
restraint and mutual accommodation in negotiations for resolving
the current political crisis taking into consideration the greater
interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He called on the opposition to lift their strikes and
non-cooperation program and allow free movement of essential
commodities, food, fertilizers and diesel to bring back normalcy
in all sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Yugoslavian Defense Ministers Have Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, held talks with visiting
minister of national defense of Yugoslavia Pavle Bulatovic in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Chi described the visit of Bulatovic as a symbol of restoration
and development of high-level exchanges between the two armed
forces, saying it would help promote good relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and national defense minister, said
that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has always adopted a
positive attitude towards its relations with the Yugoslavian armed
forces, and the current visit by Bulatovic would lay a sound
foundation for the smooth, sustained and stable improvement of
their ties.
</P>
<P>
China always follows the independent foreign policy of peace,
he reiterated, saying that China opposes the action of interfering
into other nations' internal affairs by making use of issues of
ethnic groups, religion and human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is an important force in safeguarding world
peace and regional stability, and China's development and growth
of strength would be a contribution to world peace and progress of
mankind, rather than a threat to other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to strive, along with countries including
Yugoslavia, for the safeguarding of world peace and stability, the
development and prosperity of the world's economy, and the
establishment of a just and fair world order." he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic expressed the conviction that his visit would be
helpful in the reinforcement of overall co-operation between the
two nations, saying his country is willing to co-operate with
China in various aspects.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia never believes that China would pose threat to the
world. A stable China is beneficial to the stability in the
Far-east and Asia and contributes to world stability. In this
respect, Yugoslavia wants to have full cooperation with China,
Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Yugoslavia highly appreciated China's
principled position on the Taiwan issue and the policy of "one
China, two systems" in settling issues of Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy of Yugoslavia, Bulatovic said that the
country would not join in any military bloc, and is willing to
reinforce its cooperation with other countries on the basis of
equality, mutual respect and non-interference into each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also exchanged views on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of the visitor, who arrived here on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Sees No Progress on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has said he saw no progress in efforts to solve the
Cyprus problem before the November presidential elections in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He also expected that no initiative on Cyprus will be launched
before June.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remarks in an interview with the
private TV Channel "Sigma" Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said he does not accept that the
sovereignty of a future Cyprus state can derive from its Greek
and the Turkish Cypriot communities but from the whole of the
people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he will not accept a solution of the Cyprus
problem that will not secure a safe future for the Greek Cypriot
majority. "That's why I consider security an issue of prime
importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President pointed out that the various initiatives,
currently under way, adopt the positions of the Cyprus government
on the demilitarization of the island, the setting up of a
multinational force to guarantee the security of both communities
and the view that Ankara holds the key for the solution of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides believed that no pressure will be exerted on either
side involved in the Cyprus problem at this stage, because of the
fact that the U.S. is entering an election campaign and the White
House would not want to provoke the reaction of the strong
Greek-American lobby.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the possibility of the Cyprus problem to be
solved based on a Camp David process, President Clerides said no
U.S. President will get involved with such a process before any
agreement on fundamental issues.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus President has repeatedly stressed that any
high-level meeting between him and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash should be preceded by an agreement on the basic aspects
composing the Cyprus problem, including the question of
sovereignty, Cyprus' accession to the European Union,
demilitarization of Cyprus, future guarantees, political equality
and territorial issue.
</P>
<P>
The question of Cyprus, which has been divided since the 1974
Turkish invasion, has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and all
international peace efforts in the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> China Eliminates Poverty Among Railway Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China is adopting measures to
help thousands of railway workers escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
A poverty-elimination center, the first of its kind in China,
has been set up recently, the Railway Trade Union Federation
revealed in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The center, set up by the Tonghua Railway Bureau in northeast
China, provides financial support for poor workers by running
businesses, and through a foundation that has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Other methods adopted by Chinese railway departments include
giving interest-free loans, increasing welfare and asking cadres
to make direct visits to families in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
A trade union official said that the measures will stabilize
railway staff members, and help ensure a smoother transportation
system.
</P>
<P>
Railways are said to be the "bottleneck" of China's economy and
major infrastructure programs are under construction.
</P>
<P>
There are 4.4 million railway workers, and 300,000 of them are
said to endure difficult conditions, suffering from low incomes
and insufficient welfare.
</P>
<P>
The problem is said to be inevitable in the transformation of
economic modes and because of natural disasters in some areas and
low costs for transportation, the trade union official said.
</P>
<P>
The Tonghua Railway Bureau is one of the poorest bureaus in
China. It has 50,000 workers, and 5,000 of them are hit by poverty.
</P>
<P>
The railway trade union is asking all railway departments to
learn from the Tonghua Bureau, which has adopted many measures to
help its staff.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu Lijun, Party secretary of the bureau, said: "We
still need time to solve all the workers' problems. We have to
depend on an all-round prosperity of state enterprises, and more
comprehensive measures."
</P>
<P>
Poverty-elimination remains on the top of the agenda of many
Chinese grass-roots trade unions.
</P>
<P>
At present there are still many state-owned big- and
medium-sized enterprises in the country that are running in the
red, and workers are suffering difficult conditions.

increase the share capital of non-African members in the ADB from
30 percent to 45 percent.

The Nigerian Head of State recalled recent happenings in the
bank and advised that it should not be used as a political tool
by powerful international interests.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anti-Terror Campaign Turns Out Doubled-Edged Sword (by huai chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- In a sweeping drive to crack
down on the fundamentalist groups unfolded following a wave of
terrorist bombings, Israel has effectively improved its security
situation. But, on the other hand, the campaign has also,
unfortuanatelly, caused severe hardships and sufferings to the
broad masses of the innocent Palestinian people in different ways.
</P>
<P>
Severe Restrictions on Movement:
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1996, the Israeli authorities declared each of the
eight main towns and 465 villages and refugee camps in the West
Bank "closed military areas." Residents of these locations are
prohibited from leaving their places of residence on foot or by
vehicle. Israeli checkpoints have been placed at the entrances to
these towns, villages and camps to prevent entry or exit. About 70
percent of Palestinians in the West Bank live in rural areas and
are highly dependent on access to the major towns. Additionally,
under the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians
are strictly barred from entering Israel and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Obstruction of Access To Medical Treatment:
</P>
<P>
Access to Palestinian hospitals which are located in the main
towns of the West Bank is severely obstructed. Clinics in
villages and refugee camps are paralyzed because many of their
staff cannot reach them. Hospitalization in East Jerusalem, where
many of the principal hospitals are located, is virtually
impossible. According to Munthir Al-Sharif, Deputy Health Minister
 of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), 245 clinics stopped
providing medical services to citizens due to the siege. "Thus,
the ministry halted the polio vaccination program of the World
Health Organization, since the ministry is incapable of bringing
the vaccine from Israeli medical providers. This will deprive
1.1 million children from being vaccinated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obstruction of Access to Educational Institutions:
</P>
<P>
The main universities in the West Bank have been severely
affected as many students and staff have not been able to
reach the campuses. The PNA Education Ministry affirmed that the
Israeli measures imposed against the Palestinian people led to
depriving 71,000 students from gaining their right to education.
The ministry's Director General, Walid Zagha, said that about 50
percent of the teachers were not able to reach their schools
due to the military checkposts placed on the entrance of every
city and village. The ministry's emergency regulations called on
the teachers to head to the closest accessible school of their
residence to substitute for the absence of other teachers,
although this goal was not possible to achieve due to
technical matters such as lack of scientific specialty or the
necessary level of educational skills. In addition to the fact
that many schools are located just outside the town borders.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Basic Food Stocks, Medication and Fuel:
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Strip is suffering from a serious shortage of flour
and sugar. The West Bank is no better and In Jenin, for example,
about 90 percent shops are closed because of their owners cannot
enter the town. On march 9, a food shipment from Dura Village,
Hebron, was refused entry into Al-Fawwar Refugee Camp.
</P>
<P>
Deprivation of the Right to Work:
</P>
<P>
Many residents of the villages and refugee camps are unable to
reach their places of work located in the main towns or in other
villages. A large number of these workers are dependent on
day-wage labor. Additionally, about 55,000 Palestinian workers
cannot reach their places of work in Israel. Families of these
workers are deprived from a source of income, which in many cases
is the sole family income. As long as these restrictions on
movement continue, Hassan Sharakeh said, the percentage of
unemployment, now at 78 percent, in the Palestinian street will
lead to a real starvation and further to an explosion. The
newly-elected Speaker of the Palestinian Council, Ahmed Qrei' said
 that the "daily losses due to the closure of territories is
twice more than the aid we receive from international donors; our
situation is extremely bad." According to economist Samir
Abdullah, Palestinian economic activity has decreased by 60
percent since the Israelis imposed these measures. "Everything
seems almost paralyzed; the economy cannot accommodate this
situation for two more weeks," Abdullah said. "What is happening
does not lead to lessening the support for Hamas and the violent
groups, but on the contrary."
</P>
<P>
Curfews:
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have maintained a curfew on Al-Fawwar
Refugee Camp, the home of two persons who carried out bombing
attacks, since March 4. Altogether 6,000 residents have suffered
from the curfew. The area around Al-Ibrahimi Mosque, in the heart
of Hebron city, was placed under curfew on March 3-6. On the
evening of March 10, curfews were imposed on Husan Village,
Bethlehem, and the center of Hebron city, and they still remain
in force. In Hebron, Israeli soldiers demanded, through loud
speakers, that citizens aged between 16 and 45, gather in the
play field of Al-Ghazali Elementary School while they raided
several houses and arrested a number of young men.
</P>
<P>
Raid and Closure of Institutions:
</P>
<P>
At least seven educational and research institutions have been
closed by order of the Israeli authorities, including the
University of Hebron (2,000 students), the Polytechnic of Hebron
(900 students), the Islamic welfare Association, and the College
of Technology and Science in Abu Dees, near Jerusalem. It
seemed that Unnecessary and excessive use of force was resorted
to during raids on institutions, resulting in extensive
destruction of property. The Hebron offices of the Palestine

<HEADLINE> Defending National Unity Is PLA'S Bounden Duty: Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily and the
Liberation Army Daily jointly issue an editorial
entiled: "Defending National Unity Is the People's Armed forces'
Bounden Duty" which is to be published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the recent military exercises off
China's southeast coast has demonstrated the determination and
capability of the Chinese armed forces to safeguard national
unity, state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the exercises also exhibited the military
quality, the high morale of the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
and the latest improvement of the PLA's combat capability in
modern conditions.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that since 1979, the Chinese Communist Party
and the Government have made unremitting efforts for a peaceful
settlement of the Taiwan issue and for realizing reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have demonstrated time and again the sincere
willingness of our Party and government towards the settlement of
the Taiwan issue and our feelings of kinship towards the Taiwan
compatriots, Lee Teng-hui still stubbornly sticks to his stance
of 'Taiwan Independence' and is trying to give 'legal' over to the
activities of 'Taiwan Independence' by changing the way Taiwan
leadership is chosen," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"We should never be indifferent to the increasingly rampant
muddy stream of the 'Taiwan Independence' or let it move along,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that "we have proposed, and worked for
peaceful reunification, but have never undertaken to give up the
use of force".
</P>
<P>
"We will make all possible efforts to safeguard the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland if Lee
Teng-hui clings obstinately to his 'Taiwan Independence' to split
the motherland, or any foreign forces interfere in China's
reunification," the editorial points out.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops, in high spirit and on high alert, are keeping a
close watch on the movements on the opposite side of the Straits,
as cross-Straits relations have encountered a serious setback," it
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warns: "we should never allow one single inch of
land to be split off our motherland's territory".
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that "the combat capacity of our troops has
gained a new level of improvement in recent years," it says.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident that just as the PLA, with rifles plus
millet, had been capable of defeating the eight million
well-equipped Kuomintang troops, can also be capable of fulfilling
its sacred mission of reunifying the motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
"The recent military exercises have fully demonstrated our
capability and confidence in safeguarding the unity, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that a prosperous China must be a
unified China, a strong China must be a complete China. The
historical trend of reunification of the motherland is
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
"We warn the Taiwan authorities not to risk danger in
desperation and act against the trend of times," the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also "advise some foreign 'meddlers' not to
interfere in China's internal affairs".

<HEADLINE> 5 Thais Executed in Singapore for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Five Thai workers were hanged at
dawn today in Singapore for murdering a Myanmar and two Indian
workers in 1992 and 1993, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The five were sentenced to death after they were found guilty
of killing a Myanmar worker and of robbery and murder of two
Indian workers at construction sites in 1992 and September 1993
respectively.
</P>
<P>
They were reportedly part of a gang responsible for a number of
robberies and killings at construction sites between late 1991 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, murder carries a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, parents of Panya Amphawa, 23, and Pravit
Yaowabutr, 21, two of the condemned Thai workers, flew to
Singapore to see their sons for the last time, on donated funds.
Parents of others could not afford air tickets.
</P>
<P>
Before the hanging, Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa had
used his close personal relations with Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong to ask for a pardon, and Thai Foreign Minister Kasem
Kasemsri went to Singapore last month to appeal for a pardon, but
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Charas Puachuay said Thursday that his
ministry and the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry have all tried
their best to help the workers, however, there was little the Thai
government can do and that the court's verdict has to be
respected.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Calls for Checking Ecological Deterioration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A deputy from Inner Mongolia at
the on-going National People's Congress (NPC) session made an
urgent proposal that the state take effective measures to curb
ecological deterioration in Arxan area in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The Arxan League (or prefecture) in the Inner Mongolian
Autonomous Region covers 270,000 sq km, about one-35th of China's
land space. Of the 166,000 people living there, 40,000 are the
people of ethnic Mongolian minority.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wang Shangluo appealed that without decisive measures, a
large oasis in the league can be desertified and would effect the
natural environment in north China, including Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In addition to large quantities of ancient cultural relics, the
area has long stretches of forest belts, oases and specific
ecological vegetations, which form natural fences in protection of
the northwestern and northern China, said Wang, who used to be a
local official.
</P>
<P>
Excessive use of water along the middle reaches of the Hehei
River has resulted in plummeting water flow along the lower
stretches and drying-up of some lakes, Wang said.
</P>

Two lakes which used to extend 276 sq km and 35.3 sq km
respectively in 1958 have been turned into sandy saline lands. The
well-known Swan Lake had gone dry in 1992. Large patches of poplar
trees are withering and vegetation covers deteriorating, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Owing to deterioration of ecological environment, sandstorms
have often brought wreak havocs to northwestern and northern
China.
</P>
<P>
When a sandstorm comes, ground topsoil of up to a dozen
centimeters may be blown away in some areas and large numbers of
farmers and herdspeople have to move to other places.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1995, three severe sandstorms had occurred.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the central government departments set aside
special funds to cope with fund shortage in the prefecture so as
to improve local ecological circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Immunity for Senior ANC Members to be Withdrawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa has asked Justice Minister Dullah
Omar to withdraw the immunity from prosecution granted in 1990 to
73 ANC members in terms of the previous government's amnesty
legislation.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "the Citizen" reported today that the list of
the 73 included the names of ANC parliamentary members and senior
cabinet ministers, such as Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
Defense Minister Joe Modise.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Omar confirmed that he intended to act on a formal request
made to him last month by the ANC to withdraw the immunity, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
the request came after repeated statements by the National
Party (NP) which accused the ANC of hiding behind immunity for
its members, while continuing with trials involving members of
the NP, Inkatha Freedom Party and Pan Africanist Congress.
</P>
<P>
However, ANC deputy-chief Cheryl Carolus yesterday announced
that the ANC intended going before the truth and reconciliation
commission to "indict" the previous apartheid government for
crimes against ordinary men and women.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said the actions of those who had fought to maintain
apartheid could not be equated, morally or politically, with the
actions of those who had struggled for democracy, peace and
justice.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said the ANC was calling on individuals who had
committed human rights violations to "come clean" to the truth
commission or face being treated as common criminals.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ANC would never condone any human rights
violations, which may have been committed by its members during
the "heat of the struggle".
</P>
<P>
"The ANC will submit its record, leaders and members to the
scrutiny of the truth commission. We have nothing to hide," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that the aim of the immunity act had been to
protect members of the ANC's negotiating team who entered the
country in 1990 to take part in the multiparty talks leading to
the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
At the time, ANC members risked arrest for "petty" offences
such as being a member of the organization or taking part in its
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are on the verge of completing the final
constitution, these objectives have been achieved. It is for this
reason that the ANC's National Executive Committee has concluded
that the temporary immunities no longer serve any purposes," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Policeman's View of Law Amendment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"According to the draft amendment, suspects must no longer be
detained but they may be taken into custody with the maximum
period of custody set at 30 days.
</P>
<P>
"We will be under heavy pressure, especially at a time when
crimes are on the rise, and most crimes are committed by those on
the move.
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, my police substation caught a suspect who used
credit cards to swindle money in many provinces. It took us 45
days to make out who he is and where he committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Because the country is so vast, and we don't have the money to
go by air, we are hard pressed for time. Barely have we made out
the head and tail of a case before the time limit is over.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, detention for investigation was intended to use time
as a remedy for deficiency of manpower, backward equipment and
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the new law be enforced effectively, these
problems should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"The city area of my substation is home to the central Party
and government offices. Even in my `China's first police
substation,' our police cars have often to stay put for lack of
gas. Other local police stations are worse off, I believe.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the state will give more manpower and funds to the
public security sector.
</P>
<P>
"However, I have found that the draft law also gives the police
some means to deal with cases effectively.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, when all criminal evidences of a case have not
been collected within the time limit, but available evidences are
enough to lead to a conviction of the suspect, we can transfer the
case to a prosecuting organ for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the key to enforcing the law and cracking down on
crimes effectively is the quality and work efficiency of law
enforcers.
</P>
<P>
"High-ranking officials of the Public Security Ministry have
said that once the law amendment is adopted, it represents the
will of the people, and that the law will be abided by with no
reservation.
</P>
<P>
"We policemen at the grass-roots level will do our best, It is
only right for us to abide by the law as law enforcers."

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Democracy" Aims at Splitting China -- Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A signed article published in
Beijing today criticizes Lee Teng-hui for using the "democracy"
ploy to split China.
</P>
<P>
The article by Huang Jiashu, the third of a series of articles
to condemn Lee Teng-hui's pseudo-democracy, says that Lee has been
selling the stock of "Taiwan independence" under the cover of
democracy, especially the idea of "direct election for president",
since he took office eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Huang lists abundant facts of Lee's joining the "Taiwan
independence" forces hand in glove. Former chairman of "Taiwan
Independence Union", which was once listed as a "terrorist group
of violence" by the judicial department of the United States, is
now running for "legislator" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Peng Mingmin, "Godfather of Taiwan independence" once
wanted by the Taiwan authorities, became "presidential" candidate,
nominated by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) .
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that "whatever the people want is on my mind", the
article says, but he has a special palate for the "will of the
people".
</P>
<P>
The article notes that Lee Teng-hui turns a deaf ear to the
wishes of people to develop exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, but is very much willing to accept many proposals
from the "Taiwan independence" forces and the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The "direct election for president" was initiated by the
"Taiwan independence" organizations and DPP in 1991, which was
criticized as improper by the Kuomintang until the end of that
year. But in 1992 Lee Teng-hui secretly joined forces in the
party, suddenly changed direction at the third plenum of the 13th
Central Committee of the Kuomintang, and finally succeeded in
adding the "direct election for president" to "amendments" in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that "Taiwan independence"
organizations, and Lee Teng-hui, are zealous about the "direct
election for president" because they are attempting to define the
21 million Chinese in Taiwan as independent from the Chinese
nation, and then give sovereignty to the "entity".
</P>
<P>
It will also be a critical change in the political system in
Taiwan, the article says. In the past, the "president" was elected
by the "national congress" which claimed to represent "entire
China". It implies that Taiwan authorities admit that the
"president" cannot be elected solely by the people of Taiwan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The "direct election" of a "president" will indirectly testify
that Taiwan is not a province but a "country", the article notes.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu to Promote Opening to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province is
expected to achieve 34 billion US dollars in foreign trade volume
by the year 2000 with an annual growth rate of 19.4 percent, Zheng
Silin, provincial governor, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference sponsored by the press center of the
on-going session of the National People's Congress, Zheng said
foreign trade will make up 35 percent of Jiangsu's gross domestic
product (GDP) from the current 26.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He told both Chinese and overseas correspondents present that
his province plans to seek for use of 30 billion US dollars over
the next five years and the amount of investment by foreign-funded
enterprises is expected to account for 35 percent of the fixed
capital investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, Jiangsu produced 515 billion yuan in
GDP, the second largest after south China's Guangdong Province, at
an annual increase of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has established more than 29,000
foreign-funded enterprises with the actual use of 15.3 billion US
dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said the province will accelerate the opening up of areas
along the Yangtze River, coastal areas and an economic belt along
a rail route between Xuzhou and Lianyungang Port and divert the
foreign investment to high-yielding, good-quality and highly
efficient agriculture production.
</P>
<P>
Zheng assured overseas businessmen that the province would work
hard to its improve investment environment by increasing input
into infrastructure facilities and training more expertise to keep
pace with international conventions.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "democracy" Aims at Splitting China -- Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that those advocating "Taiwan independence"
and Lee Teng-hui have made a drastic mistake, i.e., the people in
"sovereignty belonging to the people" mean the people of a
country, not a province.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty is inseparable and there does not exist an
independent "sovereignty of Taiwan," it points out.
</P>
<P>
It warns: "If Lee Teng-hui thinks that under the cloak of
a 'popularly-elected president,' he can open a market for the
so-called 'Taiwan sovereignty independence,' he is doomed to a
complete failure."
</P>
<P>
It stresses that Taiwan is a province of China, and Taiwan
people are a component of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Elections held in Taiwan, in whatever form, are merely local
elections, and can produce local leaders only, it says.
</P>
<P>
If Lee Teng-hui attempts to pave the way for "independence of
Taiwan" in the name of a "popularly-elected president", the entire
Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, will never permit
him to do so, and the international community will not support
him, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
It notes that in accordance with the idea of "one country, two
systems," after China's reunification, Taiwan will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy, local leaders will be elected by Taiwan
residents, and the central government will not send officials to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This includes respect for the democratic rights of Taiwan
residents to elect local leaders, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
"We support all democratic reforms really beneficial to the
interests of Taiwan residents in accordance with the one-China
principle," it says.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, imperative to draw a strict demarcation line
between "genuine democracy" and "fake democracy", and between
peaceful reunification and peaceful splittism.
</P>
<P>
The article warns that if Lee Teng-hui does not repent his
mistakes, and continues to stay trapped in the quagmire of "Taiwan
independence," "democracy" will never become his life buoy.

<HEADLINE> China to See Another Boom Period in Grain Production (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tian Fengshan, governor of Heilongjiang province, said the
province will sell more grain outside its border. Of the 15
million tons of surplus grain it has each year, five million tons
are purchased by the state, and the rest sold outside the
province.
</P>
<P>
He said, wholesale markets for bean, corn, rice and sorghum
have been established in the province to facilitate grain
circulation.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 30 percent of China's annual grain output, or
130 million tons, are put on the market. Prices for two thirds of
commercial grain are decided by the market.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xueyuan, governor of Zhejiang province, said the province
has each year a gap of 2.5 million tons between its own grain
output and total demand. It purchased the majority of the 2.5
million tons from other parts of China, and imports a small
amount.
</P>
<P>
After implementing the system of regional balance in grain
production, the governor said, Zhejiang has recovered to some
degree its grain production.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhejiang's grain growing area increased by over
70,000 ha, and grain output went up by two percent. The province
not only accomplished the state purchase target assigned to it,
but increased its grain reserves.
</P>
<P>
Swept by rapid industrialization, Zhejiang lost more than
60,000 ha of farming fields in the past five years, and its total
grain output dropped by five percent from that of the previous
five years, while its population grew by 200,000 to 300,000 each
year.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the province will keep the area of its
farming fields stable, and produce an additional 500,000 tons of
grain a year from the current figure.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies point out that giving farmers more incentives
for grain production is the key to increasing output.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjuan, owner of a farm in Heilongjiang, said farmers
are now enthusiastic about producing grain because it has become
profitable.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she grew grain on 74 ha of fields, which yielded 170
tons and brought her family a net income of 80,000 yuan (about
10,000 US dollars). This year, she plans to grow more rice and
expects to reap twice last year's output.

<HEADLINE> China to See Another Boom Period in Grain Production (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to see another
boom period in grain production, according to deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) in session here.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to feed the world's largest population, China
plans to produce 500 million tons of grain a year by the end of
the century from 465 million tons in 1995, an increase of 35
million tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Deputies expressed optimism for the growth plan after studying
statistics provided by officials from different parts of the
country:
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, China's largest grain production base, plans to
have an additional output of 7.5 million tons of grain in 2000 and
25 million tons in 2010 from the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, another major bread basket in northeast China, is
expected to see five million tons in annual grain increase.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei Province plans to increase 50,000 tons of
grain annually in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has decided to produce one million tons of grain a year
by the end of the century, which means the autonomous region can
be self-sufficient in grain supply.
</P>
<P>
Conditions exist for a grain production boom, said deputies.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, grain acreage climbed to 110 million hectares in 1995,
an increase of 660,000 hectares over the previous year, the first
growth since the beginning of the 1990s;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, investment in agriculture by individual farmers saw a
sharp increase;
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, science and technology is playing a more important
role in increasing yield.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed enhanced enthusiasm for farming to measures
taken by the central government. One major measure is to raise
state purchasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Another measure is the so-called governor responsibility
system. This means, provincial governors are held responsible for
grain production and supplies in their respective provinces.
</P>
<P>
Yet another measure is regional grain supply balance. This
means, the central government divides grain production goals among
different regions. The policy promotes self-sufficiency, a higher
commercial rate of grain production, and realization of regional
supply balances through trans-provincial grain shipments.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Flower Producers Urged to Improve Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A visiting horticultural expert
said Zimbabwean farmers should improve flower quality if they are
to retain a share of already oversupplied and competitive
European Union market.
</P>
<P>
Project officer of the Paris-based
Europe-Africa-Caribbean-Pacific Liaison Committee for the
promotion of horticultural exports Marie-Francoise Petitjean said
it was important for Zimbabwean flower producers to be consistent
considering there were already signs of oversupply in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Petitjean is on a 10-day visit of Southern African countries
to promote horticultural exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwean flowers are facing a stiff competition from Latin
America. They are, however very competitive when compared with
flowers from Latin America but quality will be a major
determining factor in the end.
</P>
<P>
"There are already signs of over supply on the EU market and
it is only the consistent suppliers of quality flowers who will
survive and be able to maintain their hold on the market," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
But, she said, Zimbabwe had made an "impressive headway" since
it first started exporting flowers in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah: Clinton's Threat not Change Anything </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A head of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, sneered at a threat
against his party made by U.S. President Bill Clinton, and was
quoted this morning as saying that "the threat does not change
anything."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was quoted by
the leftist Al-Safir daily as describing threats by U.S. President
Clinton against Hezbollah, the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad as a
"badge of honor."
</P>
<P>
"When he threatens us, we sleep with the eyelids totally
closed because we are confident that we are doing the right," the
Hezbollah leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton, upon his arrival Wednesday at Tel Aviv
from the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheikh where he
attended a 'Summit of Peacemakers," announced that the United
States "stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel" in a struggle
against those who practice the terror.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the "Summit of Peacemakers" had met "to take
action to confront the urgent threat of terrorism -- to show that
the Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Jihad will not succeed."
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla
warfare against Israeli occupation in South Lebanon, and the
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, and the Islamic Jihad
were allegedly involved in a recent spate of violence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah pointed out that Hezbollah, regardless whether before
the summit at Sharm el Sheikh or after it, has been expecting a
hospitality from America and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the threat does not change anything but will
increase our determination to continue the resistance."
</P>
<P>
"The maximum that the enemy can do is the air raids and some
operations like assassinating cadres of the resistance movement,"
Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
"And if (Israel) could kill leaders of Hezbollah, the party
would have more," he added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that his party would not sit and wait for a day
when the U.N. Security Council resolution 425 and any other
resolution are implemented to liberate the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio confirmed this morning that eight
Israeli soldiers were injured in a attack Thursday afternoon by
guerrillas at an Israeli military convoy in an Israeli-occupied
enclave in South Lebanon, and described the situation of two
wounded as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
claimed responsibility for the attack at the Israeli convoy on a
road between the southern Lebanese towns of Aishiyeh and Rihan in
Jezzine area.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that one group of its fighters launched
the attack at the convoy comprising several armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
And the guerrillas used machineguns and anti-tank rockets in
the fighting, killing five Israeli soldiers and wounding the
remains, the statement added.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Science, Technology and
Vocational Training Minister Kabunda Kayongo today warned
striking employees that the government would be forced to take
stern measures against them if they persist with their strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike by the employees of the National Council for
Scientific Research have now entered the second week, demanding
removal of the council Secretary-General Mwindachi Siamwiza and
Administration Manager Joyce Ngunga for alleged
mal-administration.
</P>
<P>
Kayongo said, "if they (workers) are getting tough, the
government will also be forced to be tough. We can not work and
attend to their problem under duress."
</P>
<P>
"I am writing them a letter to call off their strike so that
we can start talking in a calm atmosphere," said Kayongo who is
also chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
The minister ordered all striking workers to begin work
immediately while investigations and consultation were being
followed with relevant people concerned.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the council allegedly has paid
himself a long service bonus of some 13,000 US Dollars when he is
only entitled to gratuity after a three years' term of office.

<HEADLINE> China to Have World's 1st Test-tube Panda in 5 Years: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to have the
world's first test-tube panda in laboratory within five years as a
group of its researchers have started preliminary studies on giant
panda embryo transplant.
</P>
<P>
Researchers will try to acquire an ovary from a deceased panda,
from which egg cells are to be extracted and put into culture
liquid, according to Zhang Anju, head of the research group and
chairman of the China Panda Breeding Technology Committee.
</P>
<P>
When an egg cell matures, it will be nurtured together with
panda's sperm to complete external fertilization. Then, the zygote
will still be kept nurturing in a test tube, till an embryo takes
shape.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the embryo will be frozen and kept in liquid
nitrogen of 196 degrees centigrade below zero, awaiting to be
transplanted into a panda'womb that is suitable for it to be set
in, said Zhang, who is attending the annual session of the
National People's Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving to start experiments with transplanting such
an embryo into a panda's womb in the year 1999," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 1980, Zhang had succeeded in using frozen
panda's semen to produce a giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 14 college professors, researchers and experienced
veterinarians are involved in this research project in Sichuan
Province, a major panda habitat in southeastern China.
</P>
<P>
There are 24 pandas in Chengdu Zoo and the Chengdu Panda Breed
and Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Chinese scientists have been conducting
studies into panda's reproductive system, reproductive hormone,
pregnancy diagnosis, artificial semen extraction and insemination,
as well as semen quality.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
succeeded in piercing panda's semen into an egg cell.
</P>
<P>
Giant panda is a rare animal in China, where there are merely
some 1,000 living in the wild. Through their studies in recent
years, scientists have determined panda's low reproductive
capacity the leading factor endangering its existence, apart from
shrinkage of its habitat and interference from human activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Anju, male pandas with natural mating
capabilities account only for no more than ten percent of domestic
pandas, less than 30 percent of female pandas can arrive at
oestrum by themselves and, still less, no more than 24 percent of
them can be impregnated.
</P>
<P>
At present, nearly 100 giant panda are bred in 29 zoos and
research centers across the country, but many of their female
pandas fail to propagate.
</P>
<P>
Experts expressed the hope that the test-tube technology will
be conducive to a marked increase in number of pandas.
</P>
<P>
The research on test-tube panda has been cited as a key project
during the country's Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) and the
state is expected to set aside three million yuan (about 360,000
US dollars) for relevant studies.

<HEADLINE> Policeman's View of Law Amendment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- How do the police react to a
proposed amendment to China's Criminal Procedural Law that will
nullify a provision on the functions of the police in law
enforcement?
</P>
<P>
According to the existing law, the police may detain suspects
for investigations all by themselves without involvement by other
law enforcement bodies. This, as an administrative compulsory
means, was intended to establish the identify of criminals who
refuse to tell their real names.
</P>
<P>
A proposed amendment will nullify this right of the police.
Instead, the police may hold suspects in prior custody for a
maximum period of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
This means, if not enough evidence has been gathered during the
period, suspects have to be let free.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the police are concerned over the proposed
amendment.
</P>
<P>
Guo Benli, 34, deputy head of a police substation in Beijing,
expressed his views on the amendment while attending the National
People's Congress session here in his capacity as a deputy. The
session is discussing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The revision will have a big impact on the work of
judicial bodies. As a policeman, I care most about how to handle
cases after the abolishment of the detention clause.
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the revision before attending the NPC session. We
have been informed of discussions on the revision.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, we understand all the reasons (for the
change). For instance, some suspects were detained too long for
investigations, without supervision by other law-enforcement
bodies. Some detainees suffered wrongs.
</P>
<P>
"The country has been developing a legal system, requiring that
law-enforcement be carried out in a civilized manner and that the
rights and interest of citizens be better protected. I agree that
it is necessary to revise the law in line with the progress of the
society.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, however, detention for investigation has
proved to be effective in establishing the identity of suspects,
especially those suspected of committing crimes from place to
place who refuse to tell their real names.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Banking Crisis Hits Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The banking industry in Uganda
is going through a crisis of confidence which may retard the
future socio-economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
While a number of foreign-owned and local commercial banks are
closing some of their branches in Kampala and upcountry and
retrenching their staff, others are expanding, opening new
branches and recruiting more staff.
</P>
<P>
The capital of Kampala was "overbanked" and therefore there is
no business for others to enter. However, new banks and other
credit institutions are mushrooming and opening shop where
"angels fear to tread."
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here observed that the banking industry in
Uganda is currently regarded like beauty in the eyes of the
beholder. As a result, banks in the country have introduced a
"go-it-alone approach" which has proved to be costly due to the
necessity for multiple verification of transactions at every
stage.
</P>
<P>
Although the banks are theoretically united by a loose
arrangement called the Uganda Bankers Association, there is
absence of enforceable powers for self-regulation and the
consequent failure to introduce a binding "code of banking
practice".
</P>
<P>
The confidence and pride of the banking industry was seriously
damaged due to a huge wage and allowance award by the Uganda
Industrial Court to unionized banking staff ranging between 45 to
85 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The award meant that the lowest paid banking staff was to
receive about 400 US Dollars per month compared to about 100
Dollars paid to a medical doctor.
</P>
<P>
The awards, backdated from 1993, were forced to pay after
workers from the banks of Viz, Barclays, Standard Chartered,
Stanbic, Baroda, Tropical African and Gold Trust staged a
four-day strike in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial court award came at a time when a World Bank
report stated that overall commercial banking system in Uganda
was in a precarious state.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, more than half of the 15 commercial
banks which were operating in the country by the end of 1994 made
losses.
</P>
<P>
A number of banks including the state-owned Uganda Commercial
Bank (UCB) and the Uganda Development Bank (UDB) are insolvent.
</P>
<P>
the UCB is the biggest commercial bank in the country with
over 50 percent of deposits and network of upcountry branches.
</P>
<P>
The UCB was set up as a government-owned development bank in
1972 to provide medium and long-term finance to productive
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Now it transpires that its loan portfolio is in very poor
shape with a huge proportion of non-performing loans and a cash
collection ratio of just 14 percent. This means the UDB is
failing to collect 86 percent of the money owed to it.
</P>
<P>
The financial position of the Bank of Uganda is reportedly
untenable because of foreign exchange losses, and losses on past
loans to the government and public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that aggregate non-performing assets in excess of
50 percent of total loans making much of banking activity in the
country are nonviable.
</P>
<P>
Some bankers argued that the crisis should not be seen as
borrowers' or bankers' problem alone, but the government, too,
has played a role in the creation of the emergency by instituting
adventurous economic policies.
</P>
<P>
It was said that at one time the World Bank wanted the Uganda
government to stop other investors from entering the banking
industry. Despite the problems facing the industry, many are
coming in. There are now 19 banks in the industry and more which
have applied to enter include Kenya Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Where some leave, others move in. It defeats logic and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's economy is now moving from a rehabilitation phase to
the challenge of restructuring its savings and credit
institutions to enhance its role in the pursuit of sustained
economic development. But the new trend of the banking industry
might not augur well for economic development of the country.

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- World number one Steffi Graf
struggled to a 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 victory over American Lindsay
Davenport in Indian Wells, California, on Thursday to reach the
final of the Evert Cup women's tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The German, who had foot surgery at the end of last year,
battled for two hours and 44 minutes before sailing into her first
final since November.
</P>
<P>
Graf was also haunted by a back ailment that forced her to lie
flat out on the court trying to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was injured as well after the ninth game in the first
set, when she had to treat a broken nail on her left big toe.
</P>
<P>
But Davenport continued to cause troubles for Graf by dragging
the German into the tiebreaker, which she won 8-6.
</P>
<P>
In the next set Davenport rallied from two breaks down, but was
never on the upper hand in the tiebreaker and bowed to Graf 7-3.
</P>
<P>
In the final, Graf will meet the winner of Friday's semi-final
between Spaniard Conchita Martinez and Japan's Kimiko Date.

Corneline Kazoora from the sustainable development center was
quoted as saying that research had shown that 369 million Dollars
are lost in soil erosion and 5.7 million through deforestation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Development of Oceanic Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China should step up its efforts
to develop oceanic resources to compensate for its lack of other
resources in per capita terms, urged deputies to the National
People's Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
Du Bilan, director of the Institute of Oceanographic
Development Strategy under the National Bureau of Oceanography
(marine), said that China's marine economy accounts for less than
two percent of its national economy, about one third of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
With China feeding 22 percent of the world's population with
only seven percent of its arable land, development of oceanic
resources is inevitable for the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China' per capita share of arable
land is about one third of the world average, forestry one ninth,
and minerals one fifth.

China's sea mass is about one third of its land area, with a
coastline measuring 32,000 km long, more than 10,000 km longer
than its land boundaries. Researches have shown that there exist
rich oil, natural gas, aquatic and mineral resources under China's

Li Junlian, a rear admiral of the navy, said that many
countries have achieved economic take-offs by developing the sea.
He noted that quite a large number of Chinese know little about
the combined size of their country's seas.
</P>
<P>
"Publicity of oceanographic knowledge and potentials under
waters should be stepped up to bolster people's awareness of the
seas," he said.

<HEADLINE> Serious Drought Affects Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's capital of Beijing has
been hit by a serious drought, with rainfall levels the lowest
since 1950.
</P>
<P>
The serious drought has affected Beijing since last November,
with rainfall since then reaching 2.5 millimeters only, according
to the Municipal Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has registered a precipitation of only 16.8 mm since
the rainy season ended last October, 50 percent less than the same
period in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
A meteorologist at the station said that the drought has
adversely affected wheat growth, made spring ploughing more
difficult, and caused a substantial drop in the underground water
tables in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a recent work conference, Beijing's Vice-Mayor Duan
Qiang urged that all possible and feasible efforts be made to
overcome the effect of the drought to ensure a good grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Beijing's suburban counties have launched 400
projects to increase supplies of water.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Farmers Overcome Drought and Hostile Landscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 15 (Xinhu) -- Farmers in mountain areas in the
southern part of the northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region now look to the 220,000 hectares of cultivated land as the
foundation for survival.
</P>
<P>
The mountain area of the region was infamous throughout the
country for its hostile natural conditions. Constant drought and
serious soil erosion dragged the grain production in the area far
behind the country's average. Local farmers always faced shortages
of food supplies.
</P>
<P>
To help solve food problems and take farmers out of poverty,
the local government spared no efforts in allocating funds for the
improvement of cultivated land for dry farming.
</P>
<P>
Ten years have passed and the local government has invested
more than 70 million yuan in the improvement of 160,000 ha of land
for dry farming.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale farmland capital construction has greatly
improved conditions for agriculture in the mountain area and has
guaranteed stable grain outputs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the past few years, the area
witnessed a stable grain output increase, though droughts occured
several times.
</P>
<P>
The average annual grain output in the area in the past eight
years reached 488 million kilograms, rising by 60 percent over
1970s levels.
</P>
<P>
At present more than half of the villages in the area have
sufficient grain to feed their own residents and some even have
surplus, according to the local government.

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A cold front from western Siberia
will affect China from March 15 to 18, causing a drop in the
temperatures in most of China.
</P>
<P>
During that period most of the northern part of China will be

Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Between March 19 and 21, the rain that has soaked most of
southern China is expected to stop. However the area's long spell
without sunshine will have a negative impact on spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another cold front will cause the temperatures to
drop in most of northwest and north China. Northern Xijiang will
also see light or moderate snow.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Rejects Peace Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has
expressed his opposition to peace talks with the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels led by Joseph Kony, complaining they
refused to accept amnesty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local daily "the New Vision"
published today, Museveni said he can forgive the "misled" but
not the "misleaders."
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will be able to deal
with the Kony rebels by April this year, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we need comprehensive capacity to deal with a large
scale, reasonably equipped aggression if it ever comes, or the
nomadic bandits who specialize in attacking soft targets (meaning
unarmed people). I am informing Ugandans that by the middle of
April this capacity will be operational."
</P>
<P>
Referring to reasons of opposition to peace talks with Kony,
Museveni said, "we extended amnesty to all rebels many years ago,
many came. Some were even elected to lead district councils and
others were elected to the constituent assembly and national
parliament."
</P>
<P>
"Kony persisted in killing many Ugandans or cut off their ears
and noses much of which is unnecessary even if they were to argue
that they were fighting for a similar cause to that of the
multipartists," Museveni said.

<HEADLINE> UAE not to Hand over Qatari ex-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
cannot hand over a former Qatari Minister accused of being plotter
of an anti-Qatari Government coup, according to a report
published by today's Emirates News based here.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a UAE official as saying that they "cannot
hand the former Qatar Trade Minister and ruling family member
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Hamad al Thani over to Qatar because
the GCC security pact has not been approved by the Federal
National council and the President."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC, reached a Gulf security
agreement in 1995. It covers terms of extradition of criminals, it
was reported.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Qatar on February called for an urgent meeting of the GCC
foreign ministers to discuss the failed coup attempt which took
place on February 17 in Doha. It also urged some fellow members to
hand over the former Trade Minister accused of masterminding the
coup. But the response was weak and Oman's mediation efforts
failed. Some of the member states insisted to hold an ordinary GCC
foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh only. Some GCC members also
asked Oman, the group's current head, to hold consultations with
Qatar to investigate its claims of "outside involvement" in the
failed coup.

NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Basketball
Association lifted the suspension against Denver Nuggets guard
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf on Thursday because he had agreed to stand in
the playing of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Rauf, who is a Muslim, told ESPN sports network that he
had decided to stand and pray while the anthem is played.
</P>
<P>
"I'll rejoin the team and go to Chicago," Abdul-Rauf
said. "I'll stand and I'll offer a prayer, my own prayer, for
those who are suffering, Moslem, Caucasian, African
American... whoever is experiencing difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The NBA, with a rule demanding players and team personnel to
stand during the playing of the United States or Canadian national
anthems prior to games, had banned the Denver guard indefinitely
without pay for his failure to do so.
</P>
<P>
Rauf had sat in the anthem playing and defended his action
citing religious reasons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Seeks Lawyers' Opinions on  Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas Thursday met with 10 leading lawyers and sought their
opinions on his role in putting an end to the country's prolonged
political crisis, the presidential office confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The office said the president gave the legal experts a patient
hearing but did not make any comment.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the lawyers said they put forward their views
on the president's constitutional powers to contribute to
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to some of the lawyers, the president had the
constitutional power to order the formation of a non-party
caretaker government, but some others disagreed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Requested by both the ruling party and the opposition, the
president is taking the initiative for dialogue to resolve the
two-year-old political impasse in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He held separate discussions with the two sides and with two
former chief justices and sent letters to political parties to
seek their formal views on the modalities and possible steps for
the formation of a neutral caretaker government for future general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the
opposition have responded to the president's initiative and
expressed their willingness to resolve the political crisis
through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
But neither sides have made any concessions on the legitimacy
of the February 15 polls, which were won easily by the BNP and
boycotted by the mainstream opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> China Maps out Market-oriented Textile Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to let the
market decide the annual output and product mix of the textile
industry in 1996, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
An annual development plan released by China National Textile
Council (CNTC), the industry's watchdog, demands manufacturers to
keep on controlling output this year according to the situation
the domestic and overseas textile markets.
</P>
<P>
The annual plan was a joint effort of the CNTC, authorities of
relevant provinces, and the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, this year's yarn output will be 25
million pieces, the same as that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a major cotton-planting base
in the country, will increase its output. However, output in other
provinces will be based on market demand and the supply of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Targeted output for chemical fibers this year will be 2.9
million tons, up 11.5 percent or 300,000 tons from last year. The
growth will focus mainly on acrylic, polyester and viscose.
</P>
<P>
Production of cloth, printing and dyeing cloth, woolen
products, knitting wool and clothes is also expected to rise over
last year, taking into account of the practical situation and
demands of individual provinces.
</P>
<P>
As the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), 1996
is crucial for the textile industry to achieve its five-year goal,
to improve product quality through technical renovation and to
focus on key areas of development.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill this year's plan, the CNTC urges local governments
to curb the production of unmarketable products while attaching
importance to product quality and development of new varieties.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should try their best to guarantee
the supply of raw materials to large and medium-sized textile
manufacturers and major export-oriented enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Former Sri Lankan Woman PM to Get Back Civic Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to make a motion in the parliament to give back civic
rights to Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former prime minister of the
country, a news release said today.
</P>
<P>
Bandaranaike was Sri Lanka's prime minister from July 1960 to
March 1965 and from May 1970 to May 1977 and was the opposition
leader from April 1965 to April 1970.
</P>
<P>
The former Sri Lankan government under ex-president J.R.
Jayawardena, charging Bandaranaike of abusing her power as prime
minister, deprived her of civic rights and expelled her from the
parliament through a resolution passed on October 16, 1980.
</P>
<P>
The news release said the current government would make a
motion to invalidate the 1980 resolution and give this as a
birthday present for Bandaranaike, the world's first woman primer
minister who will turn 80 years of age on April 17.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Passes Counter-terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a watered-down counter-terrorism bill today
that its supporters said was not as tough as first intended.
</P>
<P>
The Effective Death Penalty and Public Safety Act was approved
by 229 to 191 after some key anti-terrorism measures, authored by
Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, were taken out from the bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hyde and other supporters of the bill held out hope that the
weakened bill would be strengthened during negotiations with the
Senate, which passed its own anti-terrorism bill last June.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich urged his colleagues to take an
anti-terrorism measure through Congress before April 19, the first
anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is said to look to the coming negotiations with the
Senate to restore some anti-terrorist provisions.
</P>
<P>
Hyde's bill initially contained provisions that would have
expanded the ability of federal authorities to use wiretaps and
other advanced technology in their investigations. It also
contained measures that would ban terrorist organizations from
fund-raising in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Those provisions were killed by an amendment offered by
Representative Bob Barr on a 246-171 vote. Conservative
Republicans and liberal Democrats lined up behind Barr's
amendment, arguing that Hyde's bill, as written, gave the federal
government the power to invade privacy and trample on civil
liberties.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Submits Structure of  Non-Party Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) Thursday submitted the structure of a non-party
caretaker government to President Rahman Biswas, BNP Office
Secretary Nazrul Islam Khan said at a press briefing here Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Khan did not disclose details of the proposed structure, but
said the BNP would adopt a flexible attitude to accommodate the
views of other political parties.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing hard and fast in the proposal and the BNP
was not rigid about its proposed structure which could be changed
through discussion with other parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Biswas Tuesday sent letters to leaders of the ruling
and opposition parties asking them to propose immediately the
outline for the formation of a non-party government.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition led by the Awami League said in a
letter to the president Wednesday that it would be meaningless to
make such a proposal before the resignation of the BNP government.

<HEADLINE> Expert Urges Jakarta to Tap Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A noted energy expert today urged
the Indonesian government to exploit energy resources to keep in
pace with its high economic growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, Prof. Subroto ruled out the need to resort to nuclear
energy in face of a possible energy crisis because Indonesia is
rich in various kinds of energy resources.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's production of primary energy is now growing
at 3 percent, but its energy consumption is expected to go up by
7.28 percent because of a 7-percent economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a great deal of energy is needed to sustain
the country's rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Subroto said as nuclear power plants are too costly,
other energy resources can be exploited to generate enough
electricity to make up for the energy shortfall in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 60 sedimentary basins that are believed to
contain petroleum and natural gas equivalent to 84.5 billion
barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
It also has large coal deposits, with proven reserves estimated
at 4.6 billion tons and measured reserves at 36.6 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's hydropower has the potential to generate some
75,000 megawatt (MW) of electricity, but only 4.3 percent is now
being exploited, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also has other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal
power, which is estimated at 16,000 MW with half of the resources
in Java.
</P>
<P>
The expert urged the government to attract investment for
exploration and exploitation of the country's energy reserves.

MADRID, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian authorities are
willing to extradite to Israel those who were proved guilty of
terrorism, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Median said
today.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth Europe-Arab meeting in Spain today, Median said
the Palestinian authorities will arrest hardcore terrorists and
send them to Israel according to their bilateral extradition
agreement, but not the so-called suspects blacklisted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We will not shield any terrorists hidden among us, because
they are dangerous not only to Israel but also Palestine," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Middle Eastern peace process should go ahead and not be
stalled by individual terrorist incidents.
</P>
<P>
Tension has risen again between the two century-old arch-rivals
since late February after Islamic extremist group HAMAS
orchestrated four bloody suicide bombings in Israel within nine
days, killing 58 and injuring hundreds of civilians.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly Crushes Anti-abortion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly on
Thursday evening overwhelmingly defeated an anti-abortion
amendment bill which would have allowed abortion opponents to
launch civil lawsuits against "incitements to abortion".
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two deputies who drafted the bill amending a
1975 bill legalizing abortion, only one lawmaker voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
The amendment presented to the National Assembly would have
given "right to life" organizations the power to launch lawsuits
and seek compensation against "illegal acts" committed during
abortions.
</P>
<P>
The French government expressed clear opposition to the
amendment bill. Justice Minister Jacques Toubon said those who
drafted the amendment were demanding rights for right to life
organizations that had broken the country's laws by preventing
women having abortions.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers pointed out that the amendment was in fact a
fresh attack on the rights women have secured and accused
reactionary elements of French society of harassment to try to
reverse the 1975 law.
</P>
<P>
Abortion is legal in France during the first three months of
pregnancy, but anti-abortion campaigners have become increasingly
active, staging sit-ins in clinics where abortions are carried
out.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Students Protest Government's Austerity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- About 40,000 Austrian university
students took to the streets today in a third day of protests
against the new government's economic belt-tightening policy.
</P>
<P>
The students marched from different directions to the
Parliament building, where lawmakers were debating a government
statement issued by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky last night.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 20,000 students took part in the
demonstrations, which had caused serious traffic problems in the
city. Meanwhile, large protests also broke out in Graz, Linz,
Innsbruck, Klagenfurt and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Government officials met with student representatives this
afternoon, but the talks failed to produce any results. The
students planned to hold larger-scale protests in the capital
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The protests began on March 12 when nearly 500 students
demonstrated outside the Parliament building immediately after
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's new government was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said in a statement that his government would
implement a belt-tightening policy to curb government spending.
</P>
<P>
The new economic policy will reduce government funding of
universities and colleges, which is expected to result in a 15-20
percent cut in the income of university teachers.
</P>
<P>
The policy is also likely to victimize college students, who
will have to pay extra money for some academic projects which used
to be free.
</P>
<P>
What's worse, the students are worried about their future for
jobs, because the policy will prompt government sectors and most
enterprises to announce mass lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
The students' demonstrations were backed by opposition parties,
teachers' unions and some youth organizations.

BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to grant new
privileges to foreign service firms in a bid to step up its
efforts to attract foreign investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
These privileges might include the removing of restrictions on
land, visa and work permit difficulties for foreign investors, but
not include tax breaks, according to the Board of Investment (BOI)
under the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The privileges could be expected within a few weeks or months,
the board said.
</P>
<P>
But, any company eligible for the privileges has to initially
invest at least 10 million baht (0.4 million US dollars), the
board said.
</P>
<P>
The board said that it is working on details of the privileges
and industry standard companies and software houses would also be

<HEADLINE> Cuba Holds Steady Under U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is advancing steadily toward
the solution of the economic problems caused by the tightening of
the 35-year U.S. trade embargo and the disintegration of the
Soviet Union and the former eastern bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation on the island has been recovering in the
past two years after a turbulent start to the decade. Between 1990
and 1993, gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by 35 percent
compared with 1989's level, the budget deficit rose to 33.5
percent and foreign trade shrank 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cubans faced food, fuel and electricity shortages. More than
two thirds of state enterprises were unprofitable and the number
of unemployed rose to 800,000, a fifth of the country's workforce.
</P>
<P>
Production of sugar, Cuba's economic mainstay, had been
falling year after year due to lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
The country's desperate situation forced the government into
action in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment, the development of private enterprises and
innovations in state-owned agricultural departments were all
encouraged and penalties for possessing foreign currency were
abolished.
</P>
<P>
To develop the economy, cooperatives were created in big
agricultural enterprises, markets for agricultural and livestock
and hand-made products were opened, a new law on foreign
investment was approved and the decentralization of foreign trade
enterprises was announced.
</P>
<P>
The impact of these measures is starting to come through. GDP
grew 2.5 percent in 1995, while manufacturing industry output
increased 6.4 percent, foreign trade 20 percent, agricultural
production rose 4.2 percent and food production rose 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
But food production is still a major problem for Cubans as the
country is not self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
And last year's harvest of Cuba's main export product, sugar
cane, fell to 3.3 million tons, the lowest in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in Cuba's economy is reflected to some extent
in the currency's unofficial exchange rate against the dollar,
which is now 20 to 1, against a level of more than 120 to 1 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
But unemployment, medical care and education are still major
problems facing the government, with lack of medicines and
teaching materials compounded by the U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities have called on the people to withstand
these difficulties and try to combat the U.S. embargo. The
government says no school or hospital has been closed in the
country due to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The government says Cubans are optimistic, because, although
economic improvement is still modest, their efforts to overcome
the effects of the U.S. harassment have been reasonably
successful.

BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Farmers Bank has
overtaken the Charoen Pokphand group to become Thailand's top
company, a survey said.
</P>
<P>
The Charoen Pokphand group, one of Thailand's largest
conglomerates, was knocked into the second place, according to the
survey conducted by the "Far Eastern Economic Review" magazine and
carried by leading Thai newspapers today.

Siam Cement Plc ranked the third and Bangkok Bank slipped to

specialists on the operational efficiency of Asian firms in 1995
in 11 countries and multinational firms in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Farmers Bank's restructuring program contributed to
its success, survey organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Keep Trading With Cuba Despite US Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada will not stop trading with
Cuba because of the Helms-Burton law promulgated by the United
States to intensify trade embargoes against the island, the Cuban
press agency Prensa Latina reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Canadian Ambassador to Cuba, Mark Entwistle, as
saying that Canada had formally protested the U.S. law in a
memorandum to U.S. Trade Representative Mike Kantor.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton promulgated the Helms-Burton law on
March 12, which will punish any enterprises or individuals for
trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law has not only affected Cuba, but also hurt
the interests of many other countries, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Canadian investors in Cuba are acting very
cautiously, but they are not considering immediate withdrawal of
their investment from the island.
</P>
<P>
Canada is planning to mobilize the international community to
oppose the law, he said, but admitted it will take time to do so.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, a signatory along with Canada and the U.S. in the North
America Free Trade Agreement, also expressed rejection to the law.
</P>
<P>
The United States promulgated the Helms-Burton law after the
Cuban Air Force gunned down on February 24 two U.S.-registered
light planes owned by a Cuban exile organization based in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Four people aboard the aircraft were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The United States said the planes were downed over
international waters, while Cuba insisted they were in the Cuban
air space.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysian PM' Visit Seen As diplomatic Coup for Australia's New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir's decision to visit Australia later this month was seen
here as a diplomatic coup for the Howard government.
</P>
<P>
The visit signifies Australia's intention of making approaches
to Malaysia and other Southeastern Asian countries, despite former
Prime Minister Keating predicted during the election campaign,
that Asian leaders would shun the coalition leader.
</P>
<P>
Australia's relations with Malaysia soured markedly in 1993
when the former Prime Minister Paul Keating accused Mahathir of
being "recalcitrant" for refusing to attend an informal meeting of
leaders from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
Australia's opposition to Mahathir's plans to set up the East
Asian Economic Caucus, which did not include countries like
Australia and the United States, also strained the relationship
with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To smooth down the troubled relationship, Prime Minister Howard
secretly dispatched a special envoy, former head of the Department
of Foreign Affairs Richard Woolcott, to Kuala Lumpur to issue the
personal invitation to Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Woolcott were reported having talked for 50
minutes Thursday and reached an agreement on a meeting with Howard
in Brisbane, East Australia, on March 29.
</P>
<P>
The informal meeting will take place following a state visit by
Mahathir to New Zealand. Mahathir also agreed to hold an earlier
meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer en
route to Wellington on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders is a significant diplomatic
breakthrough for the new coalition government, and an evidence of
the new government's ambition to maintain the push by Australia
for close political and economic relations with the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, a suggestion was raised in the
newspapers that Australia is now likely to take advantage of the
meeting to convince Malaysia to overturn its veto on Australia's
attendance at future Asia-Europe meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that Mahathir's visit is also an encouraging
sign for an Australian bid to build patrol boats worth 2.25
billion US dollars for the Malaysian navy.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Haven for Rare Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight species of rare
trees are growing in northwest China's Gansu Province, a
survey conducted by forestry experts has shown.
</P>
<P>
Being far away from the ocean, with complicated terrains and
features, the province offered a suitable place and ideal climatic
conditions for various kinds of rare tree species to survive.
</P>
<P>
They are scattered around the province, growing in the
mountainous areas of southern Gansu, the windy and dusty areas of
Hexi, loess plateau of eastern Gansu, and the dry region in the
central parts.
</P>
<P>
There are rich rare tree species, especially in the mountainous
areas of southern Gansu, where metasequoia, emmenoptrys henryi,
tung tree, tea oil tree, varnish-tree, and tallow are found.
</P>
<P>
There are also rare trees used for medical purposes, such as
magnolia officinalis and eucomnia ulmoides. Even ginkgo,
horse-chestnut, purple thorn, and dipteronia sinensis can be found
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The number of such rare tree species as camphor, fir of
the genus ormosia, and cercidiphyllum japonicum, are, however,
experiencing an annual decrease.
</P>
<P>
Experts are establishing files on rare tree species, and trying
to grow them artificially in large numbers as a means of ensuring
their survival.

<HEADLINE> Difference Within Nepali Ruling Partner Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Differences within the National
Democratic Party (RPP), Nepal's second ruling party, over a
no-confidence motion against the government were deepened Thursday
as its leaders issued contrary statements.
</P>
<P>
In a letter written to the main opposition Communist Party of
Nepal (UML), RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa said Thursday his
party would not support the no-confidence motion against the
present three-party government to be tabled by UML in the
parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
UML has requested RPP's support for the no-confidence motion
against the government formed by the Nepali Congress (NC) Party,
RPP and another small party last September.
</P>
<P>
The opposition offered to form an alternative RPP-UML
coalition government with RPP parliamentary party leader Lokendra
Bahadur Chand as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Thapa announced his letter to UML, Chand and RPP
co-president Rajewor Devkot issued a press statement alleging
Thapa offended the party Central Committee by refusing the UML
proposal unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
They said that an earlier RPP central meeting had expressed
dissatisfaction over the excesses of the main ruling NC party in
the government.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also demanded to convene an emergency central
meeting soon to take up the party's stance under the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
With its 19 seats in the House of Representatives, RPP holds
the key to the survival of the present coalition government led by
NC leader Sher Bahadur Deuba. NC and UML, Nepal's two major
political rivals, have 86 and 88 seats respectively in the
205-seat House.

<HEADLINE> Birds Return to Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Some birds that people in Beijing
have not seen very often in the last several years have returned
to the Capital, and have become quite a popular topic of
conversation among local people.
</P>
<P>
The capital has witnessed a growth in the number of birds
visiting the city in recent years. In suburban Qinglonghu Lake,
some white swans that have just arrived are enjoying themselves
along with flocks of wild ducks and other waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
Swarms of birds can even be found on Tiananmen Square, and on
the Fuxingmen Flyover, and in other places. There are magpies,
cuckoos, and sparrows, and last year, some flocks of owls could
even be seen in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Wolves, leopards, and wild boar have been discovered in the
mountains of suburban counties, while black storks, herons and
white swans could be found at Miyun Reservoir and at Heilongtan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, two swans, two bustards, five owls, and four eagles
were saved through the efforts of local people who saw to it that
all of them were returned to nature, after the birds had been
treated and had recovered from their injuries.
</P>
<P>
The birds' return is the result of the capital's efforts to
increase the cover agerate of forests in recent years, which stood
at 36.3 percent by the end of last year. This provides a good
environment and suitable cover for birds and wild animals.

BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, March 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- All the
top-seeded Indonesian men's singles players have crashed out of
the All England Championships, when both Ardi Wiranada and Heranto
Arbi lost their quarters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Designers of the Olympic
Stadium for the Atlanta Games said on Thursday they have filed a
lawsuit against the organizing committee asking for four million
U.S. dollar as compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Stadium Design Team (ASDT) said in Atlanta that the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) had made too many
and too frequent changes on their requirements for the 85,000-seat
structure, costing the team 47,600 hours of extra work time.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed on Wednesday at Atlanta's Fulton County
Superior Court, claimed even some fundamental decisions from ACOG,
like whether the stadium would be constructed of concrete or of
steel, failed to appear consistent.
</P>
<P>
But ACOG said on Thursday the team was using the lawsuit as a
means to retaliate against it after demands for payment over extra
work on design modification were refused last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident in which a construction worker died when
a light tower collapsed in the stadium, the ACOG asked the team to
make modifications on the design and said the cost should be borne
by the team itself.
</P>
<P>
ACOG said the team had underdesigned parts of the tower, which
resulted in the collapse.

<P>
WARSAW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today met Polish leaders for talks on NATO's planned
eastward expansion and strengthened bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here this morning for a two-day visit,
held separate talks with Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati
and Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. He will also meet
President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and Rosati exchanged views on security in Europe,
Poland's integration into European and Atlantic bodies and
agreements, Kwasniewski's planned visit to Russia and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Rosati told reporters after the talks that Primakov's visit
signaled bilateral ties had entered "a stage of close cooperation."
</P>
<P>
But Rosati also admitted they failed to resolve their
differences on Poland's membership of NATO, to which Russia has
been strongly opposed on the grounds that it will threaten Russian
security.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Cimoszewicz, Primakov said expansion of
relations with Poland is a priority for Russia and bilateral
economic and trade cooperation should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also suggested Russia will drop a controversial plan to
open a motorway through Poland's northern tip to link Belarus and
Russia's Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad. Russian President Boris
Yeltsin last month promised to provide Belarus with access to the
Baltic Sea.

ALAM ATA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh president Nursultan
Nazarbayev today sacked one of his senior ministers for failing to
carry out government policy on state enterprise reform, Kazakhstan
Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Vitali Leonidovich Mette, deputy prime minister since October
1994, was promoted to first deputy prime minister in charge of
industry in March last year.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994 as part of a strategy to solve the problems of
large state enterprises, the government decided to transfer state
enterprises' management rights to foreign companies in a bid to
attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Mette, 49, was blamed for the failure of the transfer of rights
of a key state company, Karaganda Steel Plant, which led to a drop
in production from May to November last year.
</P>
<P>
Mette submitted his resignation last week, according to Kazakh
Central Television.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Striking underground railway
workers in the Romanian capital returned to work this evening
after management threatened to sack them.
</P>
<P>
The underground system reopened after most of the 6,000 staff
ended their 10-day strike despite the government's failure to meet
their demands for a 48 percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
Management had earlier threatened them with the sack unless they
returned to work immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government insisted their 48 percent pay claim had no
justification.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said in a television
speech Wednesday that their demand will not be met because their
average monthly salary is already 31 percent higher than that of
other workers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Metro workers earned an average monthly salary of 153
U.S. dollars in January, with other workers averaging only 116
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which some say could cost the country 3.5 million
U.S. dollars brought chaos to the city's public traffic as more
than 700,000 people switched to buses or private cars to get to
work, and there was heavier than normal traffic in downtown
Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The government tried to ease transport problems by providing
government vehicles.

MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of

to the anti-Cuba move by reaffirming its opposition to
U.S. interference in Cuba's domestic affairs.

The First Deputy Director of the Press Bureau of Russian
Foreign Ministry M. Jemurin, told the press that Russia will work
with Cuba in fields of mutual interest and singled out economic
cooperation as their first priority.

KIEV, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ukranian crisis-ridden economy
witnessed positive signs for the first time in four years last
year as major indexes indicated a moderate improvement.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy Vasily Gureyev today told a cabinet meeting
that the gross domestic product of the country dropped 11.8
percent in 1995 as against a fall of 13 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The negative growth rate in industry for 1995 was a
slowing-down 11.5 percent in comparison with the 25 percent in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Light industry, building material and machinery industries bore
the brunt of the decrease in the past year, Gureyev said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was brought down with immense efforts to
281.7 percent last year from an annual rate of 500 percent in 1994
and a 1,126 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade, however, was on the rise in 1995 as preliminary
statistics pointed to a 17.7-percent increase to 21.8 billion
U.S. dollars in all.
</P>
<P>
Gureyev noted the improvement was not significant.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the Ukrainians still have to do better
to tide over their first economic crisis since they announced
independence from the former Soviet Union four years ago.

MEXICO CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexico rose from the world's
19th to its 16th biggest steel producer last year as production of
liquefied steel jumped 18.4 percent last year to 12 million tons,
industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican steel industry grew faster than any other country

of modernization programs by the country's steel sector.
</P>
<P>
Production capacity has risen from 10.7 million tons in 1989
top 13.5 million in 1995 thanks to 3.15 billion U.S. dollars of
investment over the last few years, Canacero's director general
Rodolfo Tapia Abarca said.
</P>
<P>
Capacity will rise further to 15.3 million tons as a further
one billion dollars is invested in the sector over the next two

HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Department

products, if not serious enough to face a legal charge, may end in
permanent surrender of quotas.

textile products could face the most severe punishment of losing
their quotas and the textiles control registration for ever, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Such cases of malpractice as the false labeling of textiles
products could be an offense in law, upon which a maximum penalty

<HEADLINE> Fujian Province to Hold Trade Fair in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A large delegation from east
China's Fujian Province will organize a trade fair here, from
Friday to early next week.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation conference on Fujian's economic development
for China's Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000) and the trade
fair, Fujian's Assistant Governor Li Qingzhou said Thursday that
his province has maintained a sound, sustained and fast economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past five years, Fujian Province has
established economic and trade relations with over 130 countries
and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Fujian's total export value reached 9.3 billion US
dollars, rising to the fifth place in China.
</P>
<P>
Fujian now has 18,551 overseas-funded enterprises with
contracted investments of 38.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Fujian now has three airports operating 90-odd
domestic and overseas routes and it also has three ports linking
with 126 ports in the world.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure was greatly improved with progress scored in
 power industry and telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-year Plan period, Fujian expects more
overseas investment and trade cooperation from Hong Kong and
Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as an international financial center, trade
center and shipping center, Hong Kong has contributed greatly to
Fujian's development and it will continue to serve as a bridge for
Fujian to go to the outside world in coming years.
</P>
<P>
He said that new cooperation between Fujian and Hong Kong and
other economies in the world will emerge with China adopting its

<HEADLINE> Cuba Says U.S. Law Violates Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. law passed recently to
reinforce economic embargo against Cuba has violated the Cuban
people's human rights and is a grave interference in the internal
affairs of other countries, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Marianela Ferriol, director of the Foreign Ministry's
Information Department, told a press conference that the Cuban
revolution will not be destroyed or suppressed, since the Cuban
people have always been prepared to confront the most difficult
situations created by the "unjust and irrational" attitude of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law on March 12 the
Helms-Burton Bill reinforcing U.S. economic embargo against
Cuba. The law will also punish other countries conducting trade
with the island country.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S. sanctions came after the Cuban Air Force shot
down two U.S.-registered light airplanes owned by a Cuban exile
organization headquartered in Miami when the aircraft invaded the
Cuban air space.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the growing international condemnation of
the U.S. legislation showed how isolated the U.S. is in pursuing
its anti-Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
Ferriol said Cuban First Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos
flew to Santiago de Chile today, the first stop of a tour that
will include Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Uruguay and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
She said Bolanos will meet officials of those countries and
discuss with them the latest developments in the Cuban-U.S.
standoff.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Ban Helps Ease Congestions in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing traffic is flowing
easier following the introduction of a local decree to prohibit
certain vehicles from downtown roads.
</P>
<P>
The local traffic police authority issued the decree last
month, saying that except on holidays, jeeps, light buses,
mini-buses and sedan cars bearing licence plates ending with an
odd number had to drive only on odd-numbered days in areas within
the Third Ring Road from 7 am to 8 pm.
</P>
<P>
And those bearing licence plates ending with an even number
were allowed to travel in such areas only on even-numbered days.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars and other vehicles passing within the
capital's Second Ring Road during peak hours declined by about ten
percent in the first week of March, "China Daily" today quoted
Yang Guoping of the Municipal Public Security Traffic
Administrative Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Within the Third Ring Road, the number of vans, trucks and
other delivery vehicles has been cut by over 17 percent, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
But on Beijing's busiest downtown streets, the traffic
reduction averaged only 5.7 to 6.5 percent, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang attributed the improvements to police efforts in the last
few weeks to intensify traffic control and ensure traffic
violators are penalized.
</P>
<P>
In the first week of March alone, Yang said, 800 traffic police
were sent out to inspect and control the traffic.
</P>
<P>
While also revoking 70 driving licences, the police issued
1,145 notices imposing fines on drivers who were found to have
violated the ban.

<HEADLINE> China Breakthrough in Turbine Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China has edged into the realm
of the world's most advanced countries in terms of technology for
the development of power-generating turbines.
</P>
<P>
It follows the completion of a research project on developing
long vanes, a key element of turbines. More than 100 Chinese
scientists were involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
The research team, made up of experts from the Shanghai Design
Institute of Power-generating Equipment and many other relevant
institutions, took five years to hatch out key technologies in
designing and manufacturing the 905-mm long vanes for turbines
with a capacity of 300,000 and 600,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Long vanes, which determine the power capacity, and efficiency
of the turbines, have long been major targets in developing
technology for power-generating units, said Qian Yibo, senior
engineer with the Shanghai Turbine Plant.
</P>
<P>
The research of long vanes, viewed as a representation of a
country's industrial strength, involved the use of latest
technological and scientific achievements in areas of computer
technology, high-speed air mechanics, vibration strength theory,
supersonic jet-operations and its stress test, massive forge
technology and digital-control techniques.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that production and application of the 905-mm
long vanes evoked huge economic and social benefits. Use of a
905-mm long vane helps increase the value of a 300,000-kw turbine
by 3.25 million yuan (about 400,000 US dollars) and it saves
energy.
</P>
<P>
Already used in a number of power plants in China, the long
vanes have a great market potential. So far, 40 orders have been
placed for turbines with 905-mm long vanes, with a total
contractual value of three billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> hka031504-- HK Medical Experts Reveal Potential Killer to Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong medical experts said
that at least 10,000 old people in Hong Kong are suffering from
atrial fibrillation (the upper heart chamber improperly "quivers")
which can kill them in minutes if proper care is ignored.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Hongkong Standard", the latest research
by the University of Hong Kong found that 1.3 percent of 1,500 old
people screened were suffering from the heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The project examined the heart function of people aged over 60
from six centers for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lau Chu-pak said that the 1.3 percent ratio, if applied to
the 820,000 members of Hong Kong's elderly population, means at
least 10,000 elderly are suffering from this potentially fatal
heart condition.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have been searching for every possible method to not
only control the heartbeats but also to cure the patients, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The research indicated that 30 percent of the elderly with
atrial fibrillation also had a history of strokes and another 30
percent also have coronary heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said that coronary heart diseases, thyroid gland disease,
hypertension and alcohol were the main causes of atrial
fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lau said that the university wanted to promote the use of
clot-fighting drugs to reduce the risk of blood-clotting caused by
atrial fibrillation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in central China's
Henan have completed thousands of small water conservancy
projects in the drought-plagued province.
</P>
<P>
So far, local governments in the province have sold or leased
such projects to 109,000 individuals, organizations and
enterprises. These individuals then set up "water companies" to
manage these projects.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, such companies have invested 300 million
yuan to start or upgrade water-conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
The 3,700 water companies in Tongbai County invested 18 million
yuan last year. The sum is more than three times the total
earmarked for water conservancy by the government over the past
five years, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Shangqiu County is building motor-pumped wells with money it
made by selling old wells to water companies. So far, the county
has built 5,600 wells in this way.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen will establish
more comprehensive laws and regulations governing copyright
management to eradicate any violation, a local official was quoted
as saying by today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The city has recently set up a copyright bureau which destroyed
almost 420,000 illegal audio and video tapes at its opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This Beijing-based English newspaper quoted Shenzhen Vice-Mayor
Yuan Ruwen as saying that the Shenzhen Copyright Bureau (SCB) will
implement the State's laws and regulations on copyright,
investigate and deal with copyright violations, and monitor
copyright contracts involving foreigners.
</P>
<P>
To protect and enhance the investment environment in Shenzhen,
one of the country's special economic zones, the SCB offers
powerful legal protection to intellectual property, especially
developments in the computer and electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city's cultural checking team destroyed a large
number of illegal products, including 46,800 audio and 49,700
video tapes, 153,390 compact discs (CD), 350 laser discs, 148,660
video CDs and 20,780 CD-ROMs(read only memory), as well as 29,280

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Central America to Cut Military Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Central American governments
were today urged to cut military spending and use the money for
social programs for children.
</P>
<P>
The call is part of a worldwide appeal by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) for a cut of at least 20 percent in
military spending, a senior UNICEF official told Costa Rican
government officials as she presented a report, the World State of
Children in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report says that throughout the world more than two
million children have died as victims of war.
</P>
<P>
The report does not give details about child victims in Central
America but UNICEF's Director for Costa Rica, Rhea Saab, said
UNICEF will advocate a bigger reduction in the region's military
spending.
</P>
<P>
The various wars waged in Central America during the 1980s
caused at least 300,000 deaths and displaced more than two million
people in the region, local analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
Saab warned that despite progress in pacification and
democratization in Central America, internal war against poverty
is far from ended.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Mondoll, UNICEF planning director, said an estimated
total of 150,000 people in Guatemala, 200,000 in El Salvador and
150,000 in Nicaragua, have been affected by regional wars.

NANJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 holiday resort
events are projected to draw a great number of overseas and
domestic visitors this year to Jiangsu, an east China province
with a dozen famous scenic cities.
</P>
<P>
As part of the national "China Holiday Tour '96", the province
is promoting the slogan "Bringing you to a new holiday world".
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has set up seven holiday zones in the cities of Suzhou,
Wuxi, Nanjing, Kunshan, Wujiang and Liyang, with an aggregate
coverage of 77.1 sq km. Located near picturesque lakes and
mountains, the zones have convenient access.
</P>
<P>
The zones, which were built at a cost of more than four billion
yuan, have seen the completion of a batch of tourist programs,
some of which have already opened to visitors, such as an aquatic
park in Kunshan and a Buddhist scenic area adjacent to Mount
Lingshan near Wuxi City.
</P>
<P>
Each zone has built a number of villas and holiday villages of
different categories.
</P>
<P>
Lu Sujie, the newly-appointed director of the Jiangsu Tourism
Administration, told Xinhua that the province will host several
large-scale tourist activities in these holiday zones:
</P>

<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Champions Real Madrid boasted of
their convincing win of 80-65 Olympiakos of Greece on Thursday to
make the Final Four of the European Champion Clubs' Basketball
Championship.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the Spaniard cagers were to unveil the battles
against arch-rivals Barcelona, CSKA Moscow and Panathinaikos of
Greece in the Final Four to be played in Paris from April 9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
In other deciding third quarterfinal games, CSKA Moscow beat
French Pau-Orthez 83-74 in Moscow, while Panathinaikos of Greece
nipped Benetton Treviso 65-64 in Italy.
</P>
<P>
In the away game in Madrid, Olympiakos unleashed their attacks
from the beginning to take an initial nine-point lead in five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
But at halftime, the Spaniards overtook the Greeks 42-39 as
American center Joe Arlauckas displayed his prime form with a 100
percent record of 11 free throws for Real.
</P>
<P>
After the break, Real increased their lead in the scoreboard
while the Greek side seemed out of the rhythem.
</P>
<P>
However, for the Greek fans, Panathinaikos ensured a Greek
outing in Paris with American Dominique Wilkins scoring the
highest 26 points against Treviso in the tough game.
</P>
<P>
Treviso was only one shot away from turning over the table in
the last second when Zeljko Rebracha missed his jump shot, and
lost the game on a margin of one deciding point.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, both Yevgeny Kisurin and Gundars Vetra scored 18
points for CSKA who led 38-30 at halftime, with Didier Gado
scoring the most of 22 points for Pau-Orthez.

<HEADLINE> ISO9000 Classification Sought By Chinese Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chu Jiwang's eyes showed his
excitement when the announcement was made that his company had
qualified for the ISO9000 rating, a global standard of quality.
</P>
<P>
"The ISO9000 was my dream," Chu, president of the Ningbo
Ruyi Machinery Co. Ltd, said. The company's products have been
exported to 64 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Like Chu, more and more entrepreneurs in Zhejiang, a coastal
province in east China, have their eyes on the ISO9000
certification, and regard it as "a passport to the international
market."
</P>
<P>
ISO9000 standards are quality control standards issued by the
International Standardization Organization (ISO) that are accepted
world-wide by both customers and suppliers and are the same for
all countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 enterprises in Zhejiang have passed the
certification test, compared with none at all two years ago.
</P>
<P>
This year, another 70 enterprises are applying for the
recognition to the Zhejiang Quality Evaluation Center, the
authorized agent of the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities for granting ISO9000 certification
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Tang Kaishan, director of the center, said that, more and more,
overseas customers are asking for the certification, something
that has forced Zhejiang's export-oriented enterprises to improve
the quality of their goods.
</P>
<P>
The center has strict checking procedures, and sent inspectors
to Chu's company three different times. After the first round of
inspections, the center pointed to 255 problems the company had to
correct, including two for Chu himself.
</P>
<P>
It took Chu and his employees an entire year to learn
techniques and theory, but, after all the setbacks, Chu's company
finally triumphed.
</P>
<P>
Xu Qilin, chairman of the Zhejiang Lanhua (Orchid) Electronics
Group, said that the quality of their export goods is guaranteed
through the certification process.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these days, enterprises tend to make use of the
rating in advertisements, pointing out: "We have ISO9000
certification."

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Inter-Regional Economic Cooperation Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province has
recently signed with northwest China's Qinghai province a
preliminary agreement to jointly develop the latter's resources
for making potash fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai's salt lakes contain 97 percent of China's total amount
of raw materials for making potash fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
This is just one result of economic cooperation between east
China and the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Inter-regional and inter-provincial cooperation has been given
much incentive by a central government strategy aimed at reducing
gaps in economic development between China's east coastal areas
and its central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here predict that more cooperation projects will be
carried out, as the government's policies promoting common
development across the nation are becoming popular with officials
and people from eastern provinces as well as those from central
and western ones.
</P>
<P>
The central and western regions enjoy great development
potentials and provide alluring returns for investors with their
rich natural resources, a vast market, and low labor cost. Coastal
provinces in the east pride themselves on an abundance of fund,
technology, talent, information and quality products, which are
all needed by the west.
</P>
<P>
The two can well complement each other while seeking further
economic expansion, analysts say. Jiangsu province in east China,
for example, obtains 90 percent of raw materials it needs from
outside the province.
</P>
<P>
The two regions have already made substantial progress in
mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang region, one of China's top cotton producers, for
example, has signed long-term agreements with Jiangsu and Shandong
provinces to set up cotton production bases on its vast land with
labor, technology and information to be provided by the two
provinces.
</P>
<P>
In a recent agreement signed between northeast China's
Heilongjiang province with east China's Jiangsu province, the
latter has promised to invest 150 million yuan for joint
development of farming in the former, which still has vast tracts
of wasteland to exploit.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the five autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia,
Ningxia, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Tibet have signed 19,000 economic
and technological cooperation contracts with businesses from the
rest of the country involving investments from the latter of more
than 10 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, War Crimes Tribunal Enter New Phase  of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A prosecutor of the
International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said
here today that the tribunal and Yugoslavia had entered a new
phase of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia has changed its stand towards the Hague Tribunal
and expressed readiness for cooperation," Deputy Chief Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt, who is leading a tribunal delegation to visit
Yugoslavia, announced that the tribunal would soon open an office
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the court would shortly issue indictments
against perpetrators of crimes against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"Many crimes have been committed against the Serbs but the
tribunal had so far been unable to gather evidence on this,"
Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal has publicly listed 52 war criminals in the
former Yugoslavia, 45 of them were Bosnian Serbs and seven were
Bosnian Croats. Bosnian Muslims were yet to be added to the list.
Only one Serb on the war crimes list is now under custody for
trial.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said he had held meetings in the past four days with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic and representatives of
the Federal Justice Ministry over war crimes trials in Yugoslavia
but he declined to give any details.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said the Hague prosecutors had asked to interrogate
victims and witnesses of anti-Serb crimes who are now in
Yugoslavia to gather evidence for launching an investigation
against the war criminals.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Blewitt rejected accusations that the
Hague tribunal was a political institution and that it worked
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"It will soon be seen that all those guilty are treated equally
by the tribunal," he said.

The House voted the bill with 238-179 to keep dozens of
agencies functioning for another week, preventing thousands of
federal offices from closing after Friday. The Senate is expected
to approve the bill easily and President Bill Clinton will sign it
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It will give more time for the Republican-controlled Congress
and the White House to strike a budget compromise for a fiscal
year that is nearly half over.
</P>
<P>
The bill is the tenth temporary spending bill since the U.S.
fiscal year of 1996 began from October 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the Congress, Democrats and Republicans are debating a
massive 160 billion dollar bill financing health, veterans,
national parks, law enforcement and many other programs for the
rest of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is demanding an extra 8 billion dollars for
those agencies and programs in the half of fiscal 1996 and
threatening to veto any spending bill which lacks that amount of
money. But Republicans wanted to add less fund for them.

<HEADLINE> Last Serbs Remaining in Sarajevo Ready to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ilijas, until recently
Sarajevo's westernmost Serb suburb, has virtually become a ghost
town with few Serbs left there.
</P>
<P>
Only some 50 Serbs of the initial 20,000 have remained in the
suburb since the Muslim-Croat federation took over on February 29,
Tanjug news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Many Serb villages and hamlets in the Ilijas sector, which the
Serbs left due to pressure and insecurity for themselves and their
property, are now ethnically pure, hastily populated by Muslims in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
The newly-arrived Muslims are obviously most interested in the
Serbs' property and took every means to drive out the most
persistent of those who have remained, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason the only remaining 50 Serbs are trying to
leave the municipality of Ilijas by March 20, the deadline for all
the five Serb sectors to be transferred to the Muslim-Croat
control under the Bosnia peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Their reaction is understandable considering that in response
to complaints of the remaining Serbs, Muslim authorities say their
police "cannot be everywhere at once" while there are not enough
international policemen to help out, it added.
</P>
<P>
The international community's High Representative for Bosnia
Carl Bildt called in Brussels on Wednesday on the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force to take direct part in activities of the
civilian police in parts of Sarajevo that have passed under the
control of the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Kris
Janowski confirmed in Sarajevo on Tuesday that the remaining Serbs
were being intimidated by looters.
</P>
<P>
He assessed as extremely sad that those Serbs who gathered the
courage to remain in their homes are now exposed to Muslim terror.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said that he himself witnessed a young Muslim
threatening an elderly woman with a hand grenade in Ilidza and a
woman helplessly watching her car being stolen.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Muslims were looting and intimidating the
remaining Serbs in the transferred areas to force them out of
their homes. Some gangsters and looters have been arrested in the
past few days.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Companies Give Record Money to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. tobacco industry gave
a record 4.1 million dollars to candidates for Congress and the
two major political parties.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 total dwarfed previous non-election-year giving by the
industry, leaders of the advocacy group Common Cause said at a
news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an anti-smoking group called the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids launched a national campaign to get public
officials to sign pledges not to take the industry's political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that tobacco money buys influence and
affects votes and congressional action," said Matthew Myers, the
campaign's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco interests immediately responded, saying political
giving by major companies like Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco goes
to address issues affecting all their products, including food,
and not just tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The events came a day after what tobacco opponents saw as the
first breach in the industry's previously united front against
federal regulation -- a decision by cigarette maker Liggett Group
to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing tobacco companies of
manipulating nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked.
</P>
<P>
Myers said his group is buying newspaper ads and setting up a
toll-free number to generate grassroots pressure on lawmakers to
swear off tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
Similar events were held around the country today, including an
appearance in Decatur, Ga., by Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala and Centers for Disease Control Director David
Satcher to kick off an ad campaign discouraging children from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry's giving included 2.8 million dollars in
unregulated "soft money," the cash companies and unions can give
political parties in unlimited amounts to build their
organizations and turn out voters. There was 1.3 million dollars
in direct giving to candidates.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.S. President Bill Clinton gave the Food and Drug
Administration a mandate to regulate marketing of tobacco to
minors.
</P>
<P>
The study, which covered giving by tobacco interests over the
past decade, also found that contributions were particularly high
for lawmakers who sit on the House and Senate Commerce committees,
which have jurisdiction over tobacco, and to those in
congressional leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
It showed 32 senators and 124 House members who signed a letter
in January objecting to FDA regulation of tobacco received a
combined 3.4 million dollars in tobacco industry contributions
over the previous 10 years. The signers received, on average,
three times the amounts of those who did not sign the letter.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Withdraws from Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. multimillionaire
publisher Steve Forbes today officially announced his decision to
drop out of the Republican presidential race after spending some
30 million U.S. dollars in the six-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Forbes insisted that with
his money he made "an enormous and positive contribution to the
future of our country."
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who came third with less than 80 GOP convention
delegates, expressed his support to the Republican presidential
front-runner Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Dole, after a faltering start, has left his rivals in the dust by
capturing one-third of the 996 delegates needed for the nomination
for the Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you I believe I made the best investment any of us
can make. I tried to make my country a better, stronger and finer
place," Forbes said. He was surrounded by his four daughters and
a group of supporters cheering: ``Steve 2000.''
</P>
<P>
For his money, Forbes won Republican primaries in Arizona and
Delaware. A total of 900,545 votes, accounting for some 16 percent
of those cast, supported Forbes.
</P>
<P>
Forbes decided to quit the race after Dole swept Republican
primaries in Florida, Texas and other five states on "Super
Tuesday." He said that the 72-year-old Senate Republican leader
"has truly earned our support and our help."
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate it very much. And I'm happy to have him as part
of our team," Dole told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Forbes pledged to continue to fight for his "growth, hope and
opportunity" ideas _ a flat tax, term limits, a new system of
Social Security, medical savings accounts among them.
</P>
<P>
There are four runners left in the republican party to win the
nomination at the GOP National Convention in San Diego in August.
</P>
<P>
The major threat facing Dole is from conservative political
commentator Pat Buchanan. Buchanan, who has been advocating
"American First" and trade protection, has rejected Dole's
repeated conciliatory calls and vowed to fight with him until the
San Diego convention.

UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called upon the National Provisional
Ruling Council of Sierra Leone to take all necessary measures to
protect civilians in the coming presidential run-off.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Julius Maada Bio, Chairman of the National
Provisional Ruling Council, the secretary-general said he was
encouraged that the first round of legislative and presidential
elections took place successfully on 26 and 27 February 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general said he was greatly concerned by
reports of continued armed attacks against innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to Your Excellency and to your Administration to take
all necessary measures to ensure the protection of the civilian
population from intimidation and attacks by elements hostile to
the democratic process, so that the electoral process can be
completed in a free and fair manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the presidential elections, no candidate
gained the majority votes. The second round of elections is
scheduled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Revolutionary United Front, who have been fighting successive
governments since 1991, oppose the elections.
</P>
<P>
Julius Maada Bio, a military leader, seized power in January.
He agreed to let the elections go ahead as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club Agrees to Defer Russia Debt Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, Mar 14 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Club agreed today in
principle to defer Russia's debt repayment following the talks
between the club's Chairman, Christian Noyer, and Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As another result of the talks held in Moscow, the Paris Club
also agreed to admit Russia into it this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, who took part in the talks, told
reporters that Russia's current debt to the Paris Club amounts to
some 38 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a practical solution to defer Rusia's payments
for a significant period," he said, adding that this would enable
Russia to release the funds earmarked as payments and use them for
the development of national economy.
</P>
<P>
A political statement on Russia joining the club can be made at
the next Group of Seven summit in Lyons, France, next June,
Davydov said. Russia will take part in the planned meeting.
</P>
<P>
Once Russia joins the club, the probability that Third World
countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Angola and others
will pay their some 130-billion-dollar debt to Russia will
increase, the Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Tkachenko, Russia's trade representative in France,
was appointed an observer at the Paris Club starting next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Record Earnings for U.S. Commercial Banks in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commercial banks earned a
record 48.8 billion dollars in 1995, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 commercial bank earnings were 9.4 percent higher than
the previous record in 1994 of 44.6 billion dollars and also the
fourth straight record.
</P>
<P>
Earnings of the fourth quarter were 12.1 billion dollars, down
from 13.8 billion in the third quarter of 1995 but up from 10.7
billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
FDIC said that 68 percent of commercial banks reported higher
earnings in 1995 than the previous year due to a 10.4 percent gain
in loans, the strongest rise since 1977, and limits on expenses.
</P>
<P>
But commercial banks are increasingly concerned about the
rising delinquencies in consumer loans which gained by 1.2 billion
dollars in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
FDIC chairman Ricki Helfer said that "we are concerned about
these trends and we are certainly monitoring them closely."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that regulators were closely examining bank
lending standards and other aspects of the consumer business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The American Bankers Association also said today
that credit delinquency survey showed credit card accounts that
were 30 days or more overdue rose to 3.34 percent in the last
quarter of 1995, up from 3.30 percent in the previous quarter and

credit card accounts rose to 4.45 percent, up from 3.20 percent in

<HEADLINE> Ankara Donors Conference Makes A Good Start: Bosnian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's presidential envoy
Muhammed Sacirbey said here today that the Ankara conference for
training and equipping the Bosnia Federation troops was "a good
start" despite the fact that the promised contribution was far
less than expected.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced today it would contribute 100 million
U.S. dollars worth of military equipment for the qualitative
improvements in the military forces of the Bosnia Federation,
while Turkey promised 2 million dollars for training the Bosnian
troops.
</P>
<P>
Although some other countries expressed willingness to make
contributions in the future, the donation within sight fell far
less than 750 million dollars which the Bosnia Federation said was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that this conference made a good start,"
said Sacirbey, the former Foreign Minister, as he walked out of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the big obstacles we have here in this
conference is misunderstanding by some, whatever it is about," he
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the worries that the controversial "train and
equip" project will threaten to undermine fledgling disarmament
efforts in the region, Sacirbey said the creation of military
balance was one of the means "to make the peace work."
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that some maybe didn't understand and did not want
to understand," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that more contribution will be made in the future by
other countries attending today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 32 countries gathered here today for a
one-day conference aimed at raising money to build up the Bosnian
federal army.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by Turkey and the United States,
has met criticism from European countries, which say the money
would be better spent on rebuilding the war-ravaged country.

Tobaiwa Mudede said tonight the presidential elections will go
ahead as scheduled despite the withdrawal of all candidates
challenging President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Mudede said two opposition candidates' withdrawals were
invalid in terms of the section 90 of the electoral act which
stipulates that polling out can only be done 21 days before
polling.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Vice-President Joshua Nkomo has described retired
bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United Parties as a cheat following
his last minute withdrawal from this weekend's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
''All they wanted was money from their gullible sponsors. They
knew that they would not win but they convinced their sponsors to
part with millions of dollars and now they have reneged,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Muzorewa withdrew from the race after the Supreme Court
dismissed his party's application to have the elections
postponed.
</P>
<P>
The United Parties was seeking a postponement, citing flaws in
the constitution and electoral act which they say are rigged in
favour of the Ruling ZANU (pf).
</P>
<P>
ZANU (ndonga) leader Ndabaningi Sithole withdrew from the
elections on Tuesday, claiming he had uncovered Central
Intelligence Organisation documents which disclose how the secret
police had framed charges that he had planned to kill Mugabe and
overthrow the government.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Attributes Hezbollah's Presence to Israeli Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri attributed here today the presence of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah (Party of God) to the Israeli occupation, stressing that
no one could prevent people from resisting the occupation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister refuted an Israeli excuse that a continuity
of the Israeli occupation was due to the presence of Hezbollah
militants in south Lebanon, noting that the excuse is aimed at
maintaining the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli occupation of south Lebanon started in 1978 and
there was not a Hezbollah at that time," Hariri pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel still refuses to recognize and accept the
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for Israel's
withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories "without a
reservation and condition."
</P>
<P>
In view of the Israeli policy, "we doubt the Israeli wills,"
the Lebanese leader said, adding that "despite that, we
participated in the peace negotiations in order to achieve a
liberation of our occupied land."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resistance is a response to the
occupation just like what happened in other countries, and "there
is no one able to prevent the people from resisting the
occupation in order to recover their occupied lands."
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,100-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks
on its northern jewish settlements. The zone is routinely
patrolled by Israeli troops and Israeli-financed South Lebanon
Army militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting a demand to disarm Hezbollah, the Lebanese prime
minister asked, "How can Lebanon operates militarily against
citizens resisting to end the occupation at a time when this
occupation continues to exist? This means we facilitate the
presence of the occupation and this is impossible."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there will not be a need for the
resistance after peace is achieved since the reason for the
existence of the resistance is eliminated then.
</P>
<P>
He announced that with an end of the Israeli occupation, all
the armed groups in Lebanon will hand in their weapons to the
Lebanese government and Hezbollah will limit its activities in
the political field.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated Lebanon's refusal to settle some 250,000
Palestinian refugees in this country, stressing that these
refugees should return to their homelands in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He called for negotiations in the framework of the peace
process in order to return all the refugees to the lands from
where they had been expelled.
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement and the naturalization (of the Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon) is impossible," Hariri said. "Because this
affects the present Lebanese structure, especially in the
direction of politics and democracy."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also disclosed that the Lebanese security
forces have already taken measures to prevent a possible entry of
some of those Palestinians who could be deported by the Israeli
authorities in a revenge for a recent wave of suicide bombings in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hariri hoped that his visit to Egypt scheduled on Saturday will
help strengthen the relations between Lebanon and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Blasts Duma Decision as "Scandal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Bori Yeltsin
today called "scandalous" the State Duma's resolution which
declares null and voiddalous the December 1991 accord on dissolution
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the Security Council,
Yeltsin stressed that the decision "was adopted by a body which
does not care about Russia and Russians."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, lower house of the Russian Parliament, voted
250-98 (with none abstaining) earlier today in favor of canceling
the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation dated
December 12, 1991, which scrapped the agreement on the formation
of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, or the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The lower house also approved by a 252-33 vote (with five
abstentions) a resolution recognizing as legally binding on the
Russian Federation the results of the Soviet Union's referendum
of March 17, 1991 on the preservation of the union.
</P>
<P>
All this means that the Duma favored the cancellation of the
Belevechye agreements on the dissolution of the Soviet Union and
the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1991, Yeltsin together with then leaders of
Ukraine and Belarus signed the agreements in Belevezhye, Belarus,
declaring the break-up of the Soviet Union and the formation of
the CIS. Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev joined them
later.
</P>
<P>
In an overnight TV interview, Yeltsin warned that he would
"resort to extreme measures" if the lawmakers voted to restore the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Today, Yeltsin also accused his political opponents of an
attempt to block the June presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into consideration that the decision was initiated by
communists -- I saw (Communist Party leader Gennady) Zyuganov's
resolution on the draft document -- one may presume that by this
move they want to raise ballyhoo in all the (former Soviet)
states and by this act to undermine the presidential elections,"
the Russian president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resolution had evoked his indignation. As a
person responsible for the foreign policy, he would bar the
implementation of this resolution, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We have summoned the ambassadors of the CIS and asked them to
inform their presidents that nothing will follow the resolution,
which is meaningless," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Neither Ukraine nor any other formered Soviet republic
will come to a Soviet Union under the red flag. Why then should
the State Duma make such decision?"
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Russian leadership's policy was aimed at
gradual integration among CIS countries, Yeltsin said, "We shall
act according to a plan, without haste, and depending upon
preparedness of each sate and upon the creation of a normative
basis, we shall gradually pass to a deeper integration and later
on, maybe, a confederation. I do not rule this out."
</P>
<P>
Describing the Duma's move as "a populist step by the faction
of communists" which may have a very negative impact on Russia's
relations with former Soviet republics, Duma First Deputy Speaker
Alexander Shokhin said, "Because of this resolution, Baltic states
(three former Soviet republics) will be more eager to joint NATO
(the North Atlantic Treaty Organization)."
</P>
<P>
"Our Home Is Russia" faction leader Sergei Belyayev described
as "cynical" the logic of the Duma resolution's initiators, the
Communist Party faction.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Ryzhkov, former Soviet premier and now leader of the
Popular Rule movement, believes that the Duma "has opened a good
way" toward the restoration of the single union state which must
be restored "calmly, carefully, step by step, on a voluntary
basis."
</P>
<P>
Duma deputy Vladimir Lysenko told reporters that this was "a
strong move by Zyuganov in the election campaign, as it may
influence many rank-and-file Russians." However, he stressed that
the Duma decision would be unfavorably accepted by countries of
the CIS.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Videnov Satisfied with Russian-Bulgarian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and visiting Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov today voiced
satisfaction with the development of the traditionally close
relations between the two countries, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Videnov, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday, has held talks with
his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin. As a result of the
talks, the two premiers signed a package of trade-economic
cooperation accords including an agreement on supplies of Russian
tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Kremlin, Yeltsin and Videnov also
stressed that it was extremely necessary that all states pool
efforts to create a model of comprehensive European security on
the threshold of the 21th century, a system which would take
into consideration the interests of all countries and prevent any
lines of division on the European continent, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
They were also expected to discuss the eastward expansion of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Among the East
European countries, Bulgaria remained the only one having not
applied for a membership of the NATO.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Opposition Requests To Meet President Dos Santos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan opposition parties today
requested to meet President Eduardo Dos Santos by June for
discussions on problems related to the peace process in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The demand was raised in a communique released by 34 Angolan
opposition groups here today at the end of a one-day political
consultation meeting.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that since President Dos Santos and UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi had agreed in their talks in Gobon's
Libreville on March 1 to form a government of national unity and
reconciliation after establishing a unified army in June, the
president should meet opposition parties to listen to their views
during this period.
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups also expressed their concern over the
slow-going peace process, and urged the UN special representative
in Angola, Blondin Beye, to meet the opposition regularly to let
them know the progress of the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
officially launched a multi-billion US Dollar program to boost
African development, a press release from United Nations
