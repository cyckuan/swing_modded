<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Appoints War Hero to Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- One of Sri Lanka's most decorated
war heroes has been appointed commander of the army's northern
forces as battles were raging in northern Jaffna peninsula on
Friday between government troops and separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Janaka Perera would be
overall operations commander for both Jaffna and Wanni and he flew
to the northern Jaffna peninsula on Thursday to halt an ongoing
offensive by LTTE rebels, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
General Perera, also a senior officer of the anti-terrorist
commando regiment, was in charge of the forces that ousted the
Tamil Tigers from their stronghold of Jaffna in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new appointment followed reports that the Sri Lankan army
is facing a serious debacle in the ongoing war in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said heavy fighting was still going on
around the Iyakachchi base on the Jaffna Peninsula Friday.
</P>
<P>
Troops have not lost their supply route, he said.
</P>
<P>
Perera is expected to re-plan strategies following reports of
heavy casualties among security forces during the past several
days.
</P>
<P>
At least 33 soldiers were killed and more than 250 injured
since the LTTE launched a fresh attack on April 18 to capture the
strategic Elephant Pass, a narrow causeway linking the peninsula
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, air force jets bombed rebel locations to prevent
the LTTE from capturing the strategic Iyakachchi military base,
the last bastion protecting Elephant Pass, as the rebels said they
had overrun several military camps.
</P>
<P>
Up to 20,000 troops are engaged in heavy fighting exchanges
with the rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
A statement released from the LTTE's London office on Thursday
said that they were closing in on the strategic base of Iyakachchi
in Jaffna as a part of their efforts to recapture Jaffna from
government control.

KATHMANDU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister G.P.
Koirala and visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
stressed here Friday the need to further consolidate the existing
friendly relations between Nepal and Britain by expanding trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Cook, Koirala called for more trade and
investment from Britain to help with Nepal's development and
strengthen the existing friendly and cordial bilateral relations
between the two kingdoms.
</P>

investment friendly decisions for foreign investors," said Koirala.
"If there is any lacuna, the government is ready to take another
look at those rules and provisions," he added.
</P>

government for the development assistance extended to Nepal and
hoped the support would continue.
</P>

should be expanded at the economic dimension through trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>

commercial links with Nepal, adding that Britain wishes to see
Nepal 's own business and commerce thrive and develop so that
trade will transcend aid as the basis for Nepal's development.
</P>
<P>

donors to Nepal, and its annual aid to the country totals 19
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Cook held talks with Nepali Foreign Minister
Chakra Bastola and discussed ways to expand economic cooperation,
promote bilateral trade and encourage more British investment in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The develop programs they discussed included construction of
roads, bridges and other projects. The two foreign ministers also
discussed some issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>

is the first-ever British foreign secretary to visit Nepal after
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.

KARACHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The key indicator on the Karachi

1991.66 after heavy profit taking by the speculators.

The capital market which was bullish on Wednesday failed to
sustain the gains and hardly managed to stay up the 2000 mark on
Thursday despite profit taking mainly by the fiber sector.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the market opened weak Friday and remained
bearish owing to profit taking on the weekend session.

A drastic cut in the volume was recorded, from 326.11 million
shares on Thursday to 182.07 million shares. The market capital
also slipped from 513.01 billion rupees (9.86 billion U.S. dollars)

<HEADLINE> African Countries to Cooperate on Congo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The African countries involved in
the civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
Friday agreed to create an atmosphere of trust and commitment
among themselves so that the Lusaka peace agreement which was
signed last year could hold.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after a one-day summit on the DRC conflict
held in Zimbabwe's prime resort town of Victoria Falls, Mozambican
President Joaquin Chissano who chaired the meeting said all the
four external forces that were represented agreed to meet
regularly to discuss the cease-fire issue.
</P>
<P>
The summit was also attended by South African President Thabo
Mbeki, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Foreign
Minister Andrei Bumaya.
</P>
<P>
The summit was meant to find ways of reducing the escalating
hostilities in the DRC and bringing trust and goodwill among the
six countries involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and Rwanda's new President
 Paul Kagame failed to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said, "All the belligerents who were represented here
are keen to see the peace keeping force which will be sent by the
U.N. carry out its duties so that the Lusaka agreement will be as
successful as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said, "So it is now up to the United Nations to put all the
 logistics for the deployment of the peace keeping force because
as you can see, there is a political will on the part of the
leaders, whose forces are in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided on February 24 to send 500
U.N. military observers to the DRC to monitor implementation of
the Lusaka ceasefire agreement, along with 5,000 troops to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have troops fighting alongside the
DRC army against those from Rwanda and Uganda who are supporting
rebels trying to topple the DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> UAE Willing to Develop Ties with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said Al-Sahaf on Saturday received a letter from his United Arab
Emirates (UAE) counterpart Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nehyan on
developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The letter stressed the importance of developing relations
between the two Gulf countries and touched upon ways to promote
them, reported the official INA news agency.
</P>
<P>
That UAE and Iraq develop relations conforms to the interests of
the two peoples as well as the Arab world, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter, submitted by Ahmed Abdullah Ben Saeed, UAE charge
d'affaires In Iraq, came after the UAE reopened its embassy in the
Iraqi capital Baghdad on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE charge d'affaires has stated the reopening of embassy in
Iraq is "a beginning of good and enhanced relations between the two
brotherly countries to serve their joint interests."
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also expected to reopen its consulate in Dubai, the
commercial center of the UAE, in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The UAE severed its relations with Iraq after the latter invaded
Kuwait in 1990, and took part in the U.S.-led multinational
coalition that drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral relations, especially trade ties, have been
improving steadily in recent years. Trade volume between the two
countries, within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
has reached 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian deal, launched in December 1996,
Iraq is allowed to export a limited amount of crude to finance
imports of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six Gulf Cooperation Council member states--
Bahrain, Oman and Qatar--had renewed diplomatic ties with Iraq.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd met on
Saturday with visiting Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin
Zayed al-Nahyan on ways of bolstering ties between the two Gulf
Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the western Saudi city of Jeddah, also
dealt with a wide-range Arab, Islamic and international issues, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Before King Fahd, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz had
already discussed similar issues with Sheikh Khalifa, who is also
Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Gulf diplomatic sources said the dispute between UAE and Iran
over three Gulf islands and the Gulf Arab efforts to achieve a
peaceful solution dominated the meeting of Abdullah and Sheikh
Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claimed sovereignty over the isles of Abu
Mussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, located in the mouth of the
strategic Strait of Hormuz. The islands are now controlled by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since early last year, Abu Dhabi has been worried the increasing
warming-up of relations between some of its Gulf Arab neighbors and
Iran might undermine their support to the UAE over the territorial
dispute.
</P>
<P>
But foreign Ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
formed last July a tripartite committee to devise a mechanism to
deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee comprises foreign ministers of Oman, Qatar
and Saudi Arabia, three member states of the GCC. Bahrain, Kuwait
and the UAE are the other three members of the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa arrived in Saudi Arabia earlier Saturday. His
visit came one week ahead of the consultative meeting of the GCC
leaders, due in Oman on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The UAE-Iranian dispute is again likely to be reviewed at the
GCC bi-annual summit.

TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Rear
Admiral Ali Shamkhani will launch a ground-breaking visit to Riyadh
in the near future to expand military cooperation between the two
countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani will leave here with a high-ranking political and
military delegation for Saudi Arabia in the next few days, the
first one by a senior Iranian defense official since the 1979
Islamic revolution, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said that
Shamkhani's visit will be in response to the visit of his Saudi
counterpart Prince Sultan ibn Abd al-Aziz to Tehran in April last
year.
</P>
<P>
Khosravi said that Shamkhani will discuss the potentials of the
two countries, the expansion of the bilateral ties and the issues
of mutual interests with Saudi officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister will also inspect major military centers in
Saudi Arabia, he added. 
</P>
<P>
During Prince Sultan's visit to Iran last year, the two
countries agreed to exchange military attaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-Saudi relations have steadily improved since Iranian
President Khatami came to power in 1997. The two countries went
through years of mutual suspicion following Iran's Islamic
Revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Spends Over 1 Billion Dollars for Food Subsidy Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt spends more than 4 billion
Egyptian pounds (1.16 billion U.S. dollars) each year on
subsidizing basic foodstuffs, Minister of Supply and Internal Trade
Hassan Ali Khedr said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2.8 billion pounds (811.59 million dollars) are spent in
subsidizing bread, 655 million pounds (189.86 million dollars) for
sugar, and 634 million pounds (138.77 million dollars) for cooking
oil, Khedr said after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The subsidies should result in annual savings per household of
237.5 pounds (68.81 dollars) for bread, 76.3 pounds (22.12 dollars)
for sugar, and 73.9 (21.42 dollars) for oil, he added.
</P>
<P>
The per capita gross domestic product in Egypt is estimated to
stand at 4,100 pounds (1,200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting was devoted to finding ways to bring down
prices, and focused particularly on expanding wholesale business
and encouraging competition.
</P>
<P>
British Sainsbury's chain store has already sharpened price
competition by bringing in basic foodstuffs at half price.
Sainsbury was the first foreign supermarket chain to invest in
Egypt with stores opening in the Cairo area in the last few months.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Satisfied with Current Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah on Saturday voiced satisfaction with the
current crude prices, which he said could meet the needs to cover
kuwait's state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with the Parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee, Sheikh Saud said the mechanism agreed at the latest
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
would prevent oil price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are not fearing a decline in prices... and crude prices
are stable and fair," Sheikh Saud told the press.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Vienna at the end of March, OPEC oil
ministers decided to raise their daily output by 1.7 million
barrels in order to cool off the global market, in which prices
surged to a nine-year high of over 30 U.S. dollars per barrel early
March.
</P>
<P>
The ministers designed to maintain crude prices within a range
of 22-28 dollars a barrel, saying OPEC members would raise or cut
production by 500,000 barrels per day if a 20-day average for a
basket of seven reference crudes strays outside the price range.
</P>
<P>
The 20-day average for the reference basket stood above 23
dollars per barrel last week.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's state budget for the fiscal year 2000/2001 starting on
July 1 was put at 4.635 billion Kuwaiti dinars (15.295 billion
dollars) with a deficit of 1.767 billion dinars (5.831 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As the Kuwaiti government has calculated its oil revenues on a
conservative basis of 13 dollars per barrel, the deficit in the new
budget is likely to be killed if the price for Kuwait's crude could
stay at its current level of about 22 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Five People Injured in Cinema Fire in Downtown Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Five people, including a Spanish
couple, were injured Saturday when a fire demolished a downtown
Cairo cinema and spread to an adjoining residential block, security
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ten-story block was immediately evacuated, as dozens of
trucks from the fire service, the police and the army tried to
control the fire, whose cause was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Five residents, including a Spanish couple, suffered slight
burns, and three apartments on the upper floors were severely
damaged, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the middle of the day in the cinema in
central Cairo, before spreading to the building next door.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are underway into the cause of the blaze, and the
security officials have ruled out foul play, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported. Samples have been taken from the site for
analysis to determine what might trigger the fire.
</P>
<P>
A technical committee has been formed to assess the damage in
the fire, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Approves Russia's New Military Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-Elect Vladimir
Putin approved the country's new military doctrine Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Putin's decree, which endorses the doctrine and takes effect
from its moment of publication, simultaneously rescinds a decree
by former President Boris Yeltsin to approve the previous doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Security Council, the top national security agency,
approved the final text of the new doctrine Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting in the Kremlin, Security Council
secretary Sergei Ivanov stressed the doctrine is defensive and its
main purposes are deterrence and the preservation of peace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it firmly advocates Russia's interests in
the military sphere, he said, and "the text of the military
doctrine meets Russia's national interests."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Security Council approved a draft of the new
military doctrine on February 4, which incorporates changes over
the past few years in the North Caucasus regions and in NATO
policies.
</P>
<P>
The council gave all of the key state organizations and
departments two months to finalize the draft military doctrine,
after which the president will sign a decree introducing the new
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Russian President-Elect Vladimir Putin said the revision of
the old military doctrine was prompted by changes in Russia and
around the world in general.
</P>
<P>
Russia cannot "remain indifferent" to these changes, Putin
said, citing new threats that require new avenues of military
development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moscow "cannot help noticing changes in the
strategy of NATO," which in fact has become capable of making
decisions without U.N. sanction, Putin said. "We must react
appropriately" to all these changes in order to avoid "running
into surprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new doctrine stresses nuke deterrence. Under it, Russia
can use nuclear weapons only in case of an aggression against
itself or its allies and only when it is impossible to prevent by
conventional means the liquidation of Russia as a subject of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The previous Russian military doctrine, which was approved on
November 2, 1993, did not announce a possibility of using nuclear
armaments so distinctly and firmly. It just outlined conditions
under which nuclear arms shall not be used. Those conditions
remain valid under the new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Russia promises not to use nuclear arms against signatory
states to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of July 1, 1968 and
the states that don't have nuclear weapons, with the exception of
two circumstances: -- An armed attack at Russia, its territory,
Armed Forces and other troops or its allies by a country, which
has a union agreement with a nuclear power; -- Joint moves of such
a country and a nuclear power to invade or to make an armed attack
at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces and other troops or its
allies or to support such actions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces is made up of three
branches -- the Strategic Missile Troops, the Naval Strategic
Forces and the Strategic Aviation Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Missile Troops, equipped with silo and mobile
launchers, are a key component of the nuclear triad. They have 756
launchers with 3,385 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces are composed of 26
strategic nuclear-powered submarines, including six submarine
missile-carrying cruisers of the Typhoon class, seven of the
Dolphin class and 13 of the Kamar (Squid) class. If fully loaded,
these nuclear-powered submarines can carry up to 440 ballistic
missiles with more than 2,000 warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Aviation has about 100 strategic assault
aircraft of the Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22MZ class, capable of
carrying more than 800 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the military doctrine and the concept of
national security, as well as the ratification of START II and the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the parliament after
Putin's election as head of state, implies that Russia is more
actively searching for ways of achieving national security and
global strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the two important treaties and the new
military doctrine are also seen as Putin's victories in domestic
and foreign policies.

<HEADLINE> Prudential Closes To Bottom In Pension Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Prudential, Britain's biggest
insurer, plunged close to the bottom of the performance league
tables in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Its massive 2.6 billion pound fund is ranked 64th out of 67
funds, according to the latest industry figures from the Combined
Actuarial Performance Survey.
</P>
<P>
City observers believe the result is a huge embarrassment to
the Prudential, though it is not alone among big names in having
performed poorly.
</P>
<P>
Standard Life's 1.3 billion pound pension fund is ranked 65th,
having seen its investments lose 3.8pc of their value this year.
The average fund lost 0.4pc.
</P>
<P>
Phillips &AMP; Drew, the embattled value investor which parted
company with controversial chief investment officer Tony Dye only
recently, also had a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Pension fund performance figures are highly sensitive and are
closely guarded secrets. The top of the table is dominated by
niche players which manage much smaller amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
Large pension managers are facing increasing criticism for the
secrecy with which they operate and have lost billions of pounds
worth of mandates, largely through missing out on the boom in
technology and Internet stocks.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Deprived of European Parliament Deputy Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of France's extreme-
right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has been deprived of his
mandate as deputy of the European Parliament, announced the French
government Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin made the decision in a
decree he signed on March 31, said the official bulletin "Journal.
"
</P>
<P>
The decree recalled that Le Pen was condemned on November 17,
1998, by a court in Versailles, to ineligibility to official posts
for one year.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen was condemned for his violent attack against a Socialist
candidate running for the mayor of the city of Mantes-la-Jolie
near Paris in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the ineligibility came during the mandate of
Le Pen as Euro-deputy, the French government concludes that this
has put an end to his mandate in the European Parliament, said the
decree.

<HEADLINE> Earth Day Founder Shares 2000 Global Environment Leadership Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prizes were announced by Mohamed T. El-Ashry, chief
executive officer and chairman of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF), Saturday, the 30th Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
The other winner is Anil Agarwal, director of the Center for
Science and Environment in India.
</P>
<P>
The annual award recognizes an individual, group, or
organization in government, the private sector, or the non-
government arena, for leadership of significant national or
international actions over a sustained period to protect the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
"For the last three decades, the contributions made by both
Anil Agarwal and Denis Hayes to environmental education and
awareness at the international, national and local levels have
been truly outstanding," said Dr. El-Ashry in paying tribute to
the two awardees.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Anil Agarwal and Denis Hayes for the Year 2000
award was made by Dr. El-Ashry on the advice of a panel of seven
prominent international environmentalists after an open
nominations process.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Denis Hayes launched the Earth Day movement,
attracting 20 million people. One effect of this first great
mobilization was successful establishment of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and passage of the Clean Air and
Clean Water Acts.
</P>
<P>
Today, on Earth Day 2000, the Earth Day network has mobilized
500 million people in 182 countries.
</P>
<P>
Denis Hayes was recently named by the Time magazine as one of
its 100 "Heroes of the Planet."
</P>
<P>
The award was first presented by the GEF in 1998 to President
Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica, and jointly in 1999 to
Professor Bert Bolin and Ambassador Bo Kjellen of Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Happy About Elian's Exit From Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cubans woke Saturday in happiness
for the good news that the United States federal police had pulled
out six-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of his far-removed
relatives in Miami and took him to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Radio Reloj read early Saturday the first Cuban government
report about a U.S. government federal operation that entered at
5:05 the residence of Elian's grand-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and
pried from his hands the minor.
</P>
<P>
The population heard via radio the second official note past 7:
15 in the morning, which said that the plane that flies with Elian
is headed to Washington and that the child is all right
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government asked the population to maintain a serene
attitude and to abstain from public demonstrations, because any
other behavior could influence negatively the future evolution of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Juan Gonzalez, Elian's grandfather on his father side, told the
press in Cardenas, the city where the boy was born, that he felt a
great relief and happiness and that all the family was moved for a
call from Washington telling them of the exit of the child.
</P>
<P>
The news awoke all Cubans. They called each other over the
phone or knocked on the neighbors' doors to know more details
about the operation carried out by the U.S. federal police.
</P>
<P>
Five months have gone by since the retention of boy Elian
Gonzalez started and 15 days since his father, Juan Miguel, is in
Washington, waiting for his son.
</P>
<P>
Just 48 hours ago Juan Miguel had called on the U.S. people to
have his son returned, for whom he traveled to the United States,
and for the U.S. government to act and enforce the law and return
Elian.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban boy survived a wreckage in November off the U.S.
coast in which his mother and nine more people drowned. Since then
and despite his father's legal efforts to recover him, his Miami
relatives had refused to hand him over.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Pressures Zimbabwe with Fund Pledges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government Saturday
reiterated its pledge to fund a "genuine land reform program" in
Zimbabwe, but said it had to be within the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the British High Commission said British
Foreign Minister of State for African Affairs Peter Hain had made
the pledge in London, in response to deliberations at the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders meeting
held in Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"(South African President) Thabo Mbeki and (Mozambican
President) Joachim Chissano are right to focus on a genuine land
reform program. This is what we have always been prepared to
help fund provided it is within the rule of law," Hain said.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we will discuss with the Zimbabwean delegation in
London next Thursday; a sale and reform program and fair
elections, within the rule of law," Hain said.
</P>
<P>
He said this had been on the table since 1998 and the British
government had been waiting since that time for Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
He said the violence should never have got in the way of
progress of the 1998 program.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Mbeki and Chissano Friday night said the only way
the land issue in Zimbabwe could be solved was for the donor
community to fulfil its promise it made in 1998 that it would
fund the land resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting Mugabe, on the
land situation in the country, Mbeki and Chissano said the
donors, who included Britain and the European Union, made a
commitment during the 1998 Donors Conference in Harare that they
would fund the Land Resettlement Program.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who were approached by Britain to restore
communication between Harare and London following differences over
 land, said they did not believe that Mugabe was using unlawful
means in his quest to solve the land issue.
</P>
<P>
"But there should be no continuation of violence on the land
issue because the country has to maintain its stability," said
Mbeki.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Worries About Zimbabwe's Land Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President Festus
Mogae has said he fears the growing crisis in neighboring
Zimbabwe will result in an influx of refugees to Botswana and so
impact on the country's economy, South African Press Association
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about developments in Zimbabwe," he told a
press conference before he leaves on Sunday for a tour of
Nigeria, Germany and the United States aimed at attracting
foreign investors to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of events in Zimbabwe is unlikely to be helpful,
not only to all Africans, but also to us as Botswana," Mogae
noted.
</P>
<P>
He predicted an influx of refugees, "which will have
consequences for our budgetary situation because they have to be
looked after while they are here."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Botswana handled over 11,000 illegal immigrants and
2,500 asylum seekers, 98 percent of who were Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Mogae's comments came in the wake of an article in the
London-based Economist magazine, which warned of the negative
economic impact of the war veterans' occupations of white-owned
farms in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the crisis will threaten the economic growth,
investor confidence and political stability of the entire
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's economic growth may slide from the projected eight
percent to five percent this year due to the negative influence
of Zimbabwean land question, the Economist added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Businesses Seek to Reverse Economic Meltdown in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered delegation
of South African businessmen will meet with Zimbabwean government
officials to seek short term economic solutions to the crisis in
that country, the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB) said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
SACOB chief executive officer Kevin Wakeford told reporters
that the delegation, comprising companies with investment or
trading links to Zimbabwe, will leave for Zimbabwe in the next two
weeks for talks with officials from Zimbabwe's Ministry of
Commerce and of Industry and the Agricultural Union to find means
to reverse the economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
"If this situation is not resolved it has serious future
economic implications for South Africa. It is a test to see
whether Africa can accommodate the rules of the global economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"What has taken place in Zimbabwe is an undermining factor in
terms of foreign investment. There is no justification for the
disregard of property rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there are requirements for poverty reduction, it must be
done in the proper means, not through an anarchic manner," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, SACOB met separately with the High Commissioners
of Zimbabwe and Nigeria and the acting High Commissioner for the
British Embassy in Pretoria "to gain insights from the respective
embassies into the Zimbabwean crisis", Wakeford said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions centered around the rule of law, property
rights and the sustenance of democracy relating to Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe' s handling of the occupation of hundreds
of white-owned farms by Zimbabwean veterans, according to
Wakeford.
</P>
<P>
Britain's role in Zimbabwe's land reform program and Nigeria's
 involvement in the mediation process were among other topics
discussed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel hopeful there is a potential resolution in the
short-term. The land issue is now inextricably linked to the
resolution of the crisis, or at least a part of the resolution,"
Wakeford said.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame
reaffirmed his commitment to the Lusaka Peace accord and expressed
readiness to with draw troops from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), according to Rwandan News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In his first speech to the nation after he was sworn in on
Saturday, Kagame said that Rwandan troops are in Congo not because
of; love for war, exploiting Congo' s economy and of being super
power in the area, but is to deter the attacks of the Interahamwe
militia supported and facilitated by the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
"If only, the Interahamwe militias would return and cease to
attack Rwanda, or if the DRC government would deny them support
and prevent them from attacking there would not be any reason for
Rwanda troops to stay in Congo", the President said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda first sent troops to the former Zaire after Laurent
Kabila toppled former president Mobutu Sese Seko in late 1996.
Rwanda accused Kabila for training and arming Interahamwe militias
to attack Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Govt Cautious to Japan's Swap Pact Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is reacting cautiously
to Japan's proposal to strike a regional currency swap pact with
its Asian partners to guard against future currency crises, local
analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi was recently
quoted by local media as saying that the details of the pact
should be carefully scrutinized, such as where to find the money
to engage in the currency swap pact and whether such a pact would
be beneficial to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"No pact can defend the currency unless the government's
economic policy is sound," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Thai Finance Ministry official also said that the
Japanese proposal indicated Tokyo's hope that a regional swap
network would develop into an Asian monetary fund, a regional
version of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
According to the local analysts, Thai government is more in
favor of setting up an Asian fund to aid countries in the region
in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government had told Japanese media that it would
make the proposal at the incoming meeting of the Asian Development
Bank next month in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It said the swap accord would include Japan, Thailand and other
Asian countries.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) agents
stormed the home of his Miami relatives in Little Havana just
after 5 a.m, local time Saturday, firing pepper spray into an
angry crowd and took away the boy for the reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez was brought out of the home by a woman agent,
put into a van and whisked away. The boy was then put on an
airplane heading to Washington.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the boy was accompanied onboard the plane
by the female immigration agent who picked him up from the home, a
surgeon and the immigration agent who led the raid.
</P>
<P>
Elian was given a play kit including toys, a toy plane, a map
and a watch. He looked subdued and calm after being explained
about what happened, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, who arrived in Washington on April 4, has been
waiting here for about two weeks to take custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno told a press conference
earlier Saturday that Elian is safe. She stressed that the
government tried every way it could to get the family of the Miami
relatives to surrender the boy, before taking the action, but the
negotiations failed and the family refused to turn over the boy.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the paramount concern for the morning's raid was the
safety of the child.
</P>
<P>
She said eight federal agents were in the house and one female
agent picked up Elian. She spoke with him in Spanish. The whole
process lasted for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton approved the predawn raid to seize
the boy, his spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was kept informed throughout the night of the progress
of the negotiations between the Justice Department and Gonzalez's
relatives, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
After being told by his chief of staff John Podesta that all-
night negotiations to resolve the custody dispute failed, Clinton
said that he was disappointed and gave the green light to seize
the boy from the Miami home of his great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"The president was pleased the boy was safe and going to be
reunited with his father," Lockhart said, adding that the
president had no plans to meet with Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father expressed his gratitude to the U.S. authorities.
"We are grateful to the attorney general and the Department of
Justice for upholding the law with utmost concern for the safety
and well-being of Elian Gonzalez," the father's attorney, Greg
Craig, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general was tireless. She was insistent that we
continue our effort to achieve a peaceful and voluntary transfer
of custody."
</P>
<P>
"We too are sad that force was required, but to the very end
Lazaro Gonzalez placed road blocks in the path of an orderly
transfer of custody. He gave the attorney general no alternative."
</P>
<P>
Reno said that the Justice Department will abide by an appeals
court rule that the boy will remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck in the
Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned
when their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
Elian has been living in the home of his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez since then. His mother and 10 others died as the migrant
smuggling boat sank in the sea.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities spent weeks trying to arrange a peaceful
transfer of Elian from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to his
father.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Americans demonstrated for weeks outside the home to
block the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, the INS ruled that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba. However, the Miami
relatives insist the boy should stay with them in the United
States.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez is
finally reunited with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez at Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal government seized the six-year-old Cuban boy
from the home of his Miami relatives in a predawn raid, ending a
five-month standoff between the government and Elian's Miami

<HEADLINE> Canberries Effective Against Cancer Risk in Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cranberries could bring breast
cancer risk down by at least 40 percent in mice, opening prospects
for curing the disease on humans, Canada's National Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In their latest study, Canadian researchers at the University
of Western Ontario fed a group of mice with dehydrated cranberries
and then injected human breast cancer cells into the mammary
glands of mice.
</P>
<P>
Compared with another group of mice receiving injections but
without eating cranberries, this group of mice prove to be 50
percent lower in risk of suffering from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Drinking cranberry juice was discovered capable, too, of
reducing the number of expected tumors in the mice by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cranberry-fed mice also showed a reduction in the spread of
tumors to their lungs and lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
Najla Guthrie, the study's lead researcher, was quoted as
saying that "quercetin is the flavonoid found in cranberry juice,
and it's been shown to have activity in colon cencer in a lot of
laboratory studies."
</P>
<P>
In their next step, Canadian researchers will determine why
cranberries inhibit the development of breast cancer in animals
before they can be sure that cranberries have the same effects on
humans.
</P>
<P>
Canada is one of the major cranberry producers in the world.
More than 32,000 tons of berries were grown in 1998 to bring in 55
million Canadian dollars (about 37.3 million U.S. dollars),
according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Amicable Solution To Zimbabwe's Land Problem Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's business magazine
Megabuck has called for an amicable solution to the land problem
to avert the deepening of an economic crisis which is threatening
the country.
</P>
<P>
In its latest publication released here Saturday, Megabuck said
if the farm invasions by ex-combatants persisted it would be
difficult for any initiatives to rescue Zimbabwe's ailing
economy, faced with the burden of foreign debt, fuel and foreign
currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
"As the tobacco selling season is approaching there is need to
ensure that no further hitches will derail it. The country relies
on foreign currency earned by tobacco and other agricultural
export products like beef and horticulture," the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
It said if foreign currency inflows from tobacco were not
forthcoming then Zimbabwe should brace for more severe shortages
that would cause industries to close.
</P>
<P>
"These sporadic invasions surely have a great opportunity cost
which must not be gambled with," it said.
</P>
<P>
The magazine noted that farmers were set to lose if they
delayed in harvesting their crops because of the farm occupations.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants have occupied about 1,000 white commercial
farms since February, this year.
</P>
<P>
This would force the country to import foodstuffs straining the
already stretched foreign currency stocks, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the agricultural sector due to lawlessness
might heavily affect industrial production due to a shortage of
raw materials, leading to a decline in economic growth," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the breakdown of law displayed by the
invasions would send wrong signals to investors and the
international community that there was no peace in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
This would scare foreign investors who might believe that the
Zimbabwean economy was not conducive to business ventures.
</P>
<P>
"Investors might also be afraid of uncertainties lying in the
future since their businesses may be targets for future invasions
by the war veterans," it said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy is agro-based with most industrial inputs
coming from the farming and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has with immediate effect frozen aid to Zimbabwe over
the farm invasions while the British Airways has moved its crew
base from Zimbabwe to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Russia May Extend Territorial Row Talks With Japan Beyond 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian president-elect Vladimir
Putin will likely postpone the resolution of a Russo-Japanese
territorial dispute beyond the end of this year, Kyodo News Agency
quoted a senior Russian government official as indicating on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had previously agreed to sign a peace treaty
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"A territorial problem is so delicate that we need a weighing-
in and preparations. And time is needed as well," Russian Vice
Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov in charge of Asia-Pacific
issues was quoted as saying in an interview with Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
Any negotiations will require compromise, said Losyukov.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official made the remarks ahead of the first
meeting between Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori,
scheduled for April 29 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit will provide Mori and Putin, who will be
sworn on May 7, with an occasion to become "good acquaintances,"
Losyukov said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to mention a specific date for a proposed official
visit to Japan by Putin, saying it would be decided by the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes that a document covering comprehensive bilateral
relations will be issued when Putin visits Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, former Japanese prime minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto met with former Russian president Boris Yeltsin in the
suburbs of Moscow on Saturday to discuss the territorial disputes
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who is now chief foreign policy adviser to Japanese
Prime Minister Mori, exchanged views on the fulfillment of
agreements they reached in Russia's Krasnoyarsk in 1997 and in
Kawana, Japan, in 1998, Kyodo quoted sources close to Yeltsin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Krasnoyarsk in 1997, then Russian President
Yeltsin and then Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto agreed that
their countries would work to resolve the disputes and sign a
peace treaty by the end of 2000. But negotiations have stalled.
</P>
<P>
The territorial row involves the Russian-held islands of
Etorofu, Kunashiri and Shikotan, and the Habomai group of islets,
all off the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. They were seized by
Soviet troops at the end of World War II.

ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin was
decorated here on Saturday with a Gold Medal of Merit by Athens
Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos, who praised Jiang and the Chinese
government for their contributions to the great achievements China
has scored in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Avramopoulos for the award, Jiang said the Chinese and
Greek peoples understand and support each other in building their
countries and advancing world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is glad that cooperation between the two
countries has made remarkable progress in the fields of politics,

</P>
<P>
He believes that the friendly cooperative ties between the two
peoples will surely be pushed further ahead in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Avramopoulos said at the award-giving ceremony that the ancient
civilizations in China and Greece have become sources of cultures
in the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
He said China is developing fast and has been continuously
making progress in various fields while it is playing an
increasingly important role in the international community.
</P>
<P>
As an individual country and a member of the European Union,
Greece intends to cooperate with China, and such cooperation will
be conducive to the development and stability in the world, the
mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Announces Aid Package to Pacific Island States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori announced an aid package for South Pacific nations Saturday
at a one-day summit with government leaders from the region in
Japan's southwestern city Miyazaki.
</P>
<P>
Under the 21-item package, Japan will contribute 4 million U.S.
dollars to promote information technology in the Pacific island
nations, fund projects in cooperation with the Untied Nations
agencies to combat infectious diseases, including AIDS, and tackle
refugee, narcotic and other problems there.
</P>
<P>
Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that in addition to
financial assistance, Japan will also provide job training for at
least 3,000 people from these countries in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration issued at the end of the Pacific Islands
Leaders' Meeting (PALM) between Japan and the 16-member South
Pacific Forum (SPF), the countries pledged to step up cooperation
in sustaining economic development, tackling regional and global
problems and to strengthen partnership.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders spelled out their common vision on tomorrow's
Pacific, and their shared mid- to long-term priorities in order to
move together toward their common vision," said the "Miyazaki PALM
Declaration."
</P>
<P>
The first Japan-SPF summit was held in Tokyo in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The summit also adopted a special joint statement on
environment, with leaders agreeing to work towards implementing
the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change "at the earliest
possible date."
</P>
<P>
They, however, failed to agree on a specific target date,
dropping from a draft statement a phrase that said they took note
of "views expressed by many states for the protocol to come into
force by 2002."
</P>
<P>
The SPF members are deeply concerned that rising sea levels due
to global warming will lead to land erosion in low-lying islands.
</P>
<P>
The SPF was established in 1971 as a gathering of government
leaders of 14 independent and two self-governing states. They are
Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea,
Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar said Saturday that his country will not support the
expansion of permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Sattar pledged to block the
entry into the Security Council of those nations which have not
behaved in compliance with U.N. principles, pointing a finger at
Pakistan's archrival India, which Pakistan blames for refusing to
implement U.N. resolutions on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's position is that we only support the proposal to
increase the number of non-permanent seats (on the UN Security
Council)," he said, adding that most of the developing countries
which Pakistan have been interacting with also hold the similar
stands.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said the United States and France have told Pakistan
they have not yet made a decision on India as a candidate for
permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council but, said they
would consider it.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been told by at least two of these countries is
that they have not yet made a decision, but what they did say is
they would consider India's proposal or candidature for a
permanent seat on the Security Council," he said.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok, bidding for hosting the
International Olympic Games 2008, is setting up a website to
launch its official campaigns and publicize the city readiness for
the huge sport event, an official report disclosed here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has authorized
Master Ad Co., a local advertising company, to design the webpage

the prestigious sport event in terms of stadiums, accommodations,
said the report.
</P>
<P>

focus on gaining the public support in the country, as unity of
the people in a contending city is one of major factors which the
International Olympic Committee will take into account in choosing
a host.
</P>
<P>
The campaigns would then be expanded to garner support from
foreign countries, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The website, bangkokolympic2008.com, will also feature tourist

<HEADLINE> Khatami Blames State Television for Screening Controversial Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Saturday criticized the state television for screening parts of
a controversial conference on Iran in the German capital of Berlin,
which sparked condemnation by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally opposed to the way the IRIB raised the issue which
provoked the feelings and caused great concern among the committed
sections of the society and those who seek the country's dignity
and honor," Khatami said in his first reaction to the hue and cry
caused by the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iranian reformists attended the Berlin conference
on "Iran after the February Elections" organized by the Heinrich
Boell Foundation. The conference was disrupted by members of the
People's Mujaheddin, an organization outlawed by Tehran, who
accused the Islamic regime of "violating human rights in Iran."
</P>
<P>
The conservative-controlled IRIB screened some footage of the
conference, including an overseas Iranian woman dancing without
Islamic dressing. The conservative bloc was outraged, condemning
the meeting "religiously prohibited."
</P>
<P>
More than 140 outgoing conservative Majlis (parliament) members
on Wednesday called on the judiciary to punish those who attended
the conference. A prominent journalist Akbar Ganji was jailed on
Saturday in connection with the event.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined the need of security and tranquility in the
country, saying no action should be taken which may worry "the
leader, the nation, the faithful and the youth about national
security."
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who control most of the state powers but
suffered a series of setbacks in elections over the past two years,
try to play up religious sentiments of ordinary citizens against
the reformist allied with the president.
</P>
<P>
The reformists defended the Berlin conference and accused the
conservatives of trying to use the incident to undermine Khatami's
reform programs.

<HEADLINE> Study Still Suspended In Gaza Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Azhar University and the Islamic
University in Gaza are still closed on Saturday when is supposed to
be the end of classes suspension declared by the Palestinian police
last Tuesday following the bloody clashes between two factions of
students.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police has not lifted its besiege imposed on the
campuses of the two universities, even though the number of
policemen was reduced compared with the the first days after the
eruption of the clashes which caused the injury of 35 students and
policemen.
</P>
<P>
A statement on the gate of the Islamic university said the board
of trustees decided to resume classes by next Monday, without
giving any reason for extending the suspension period, which the
police had said will be three days only starting from last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wael Bakr, from the public relations department at the Islamic
University, told Xinhua that the initiative to solve the dispute
between the two factions of students lasted for three days only,
but it failed to reach a positive outcome.
</P>
<P>
He rejected to explain the details of the differences that led
to continuing the suspension of classes.
</P>
<P>
Sources added that the board of trustees at the two universities
intervened to solve the dispute in a bid to resume the study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of builders reconstructed a part of a fence
surrounding the Islamic University after it was demolished by
supporters of Fatah during the clashes last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The violent clashes broke out when the pro-Hamas students at the
university tried to prevent Fatah supporters from hanging posters
carrying Arafat's photos, and due to a statement issued by the
Fatah supporters defending their victory in the student elections
held last month.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Hamas faction said the pro-Fatah group has illegally won
the recent election in the college of education of the university.
</P>
<P>
During the election of the whole Islamic University, dominated
by the Islamites, the pro-Hamas students got 71 percent of votes,
against 22 percent for the pro-Fatah supporters.
</P>
<P>
Clashes expanded at the Islamic university after students from
the neighboring Azhar University flooded to the campus to support
their colleagues, which caused the injury of 35 students, including
6 female students and 6 policemen.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Launches Operations to Rescue Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
Saturday launched a full scale offensive operations against the
Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are holding a group of hostages in Basilan,
the Southern Philippines, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said here that the army started
the operations early in the morning to rescue the hostages taken
by the rebels in their mountain hideout in Sumisip, Basilan.
</P>
<P>
By 19:00 (11:00 GMT), the operations were still going on, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government army also confirmed that they
launched the attack after the rebels claimed to have beheaded two
of the 29 hostages held by them since March 20.
</P>
<P>
"The Basilan Crisis Management Committee (CMC) had met and
decided as of Friday to request the Southern Command to mount
rescue operations to save the remaining hostages from the hands of
the Abu Sayyaf after the CMC exhausted all peaceful means and the
Abu Sayyaf showed unreasonableness," the army said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo T. Reyes denied the
claim by the Abu Sayyaf spokesman that nine soldiers were killed
and a helicopter was shot down in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Only three government soldiers were wounded in the fighting,
and all planes and helicopters returned to the base safely, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that while the military will not guarantee that the
rescue operation will be 100 percent to save the hostages, it will
exert all efforts to ensure that the rescue operation will be a
success.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Air Force helicopter gunships fired air-to-ground
rockets and planes dropped bombs and rockets at the Abu Sayyaf
camp, reports from Basilan said.
</P>
<P>
But in response, the reports said, the Abu Sayyaf group has
threatened to behead all the hostages "if the government does not
stop the offensive."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the rebels claimed to have beheaded two male
hostages after President Joseph Estrada ignored the Abu Sayyaf
demands for the release of three terrorists, including Ramzi
Yousef, who masterminded the World Trade Center bombing in New
York in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf also demanded the release of two local rebel
leaders jailed in Basilan on charges of bombing the police
headquarters in the province earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Forces Vow to Defend Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military forces are
resolved to uphold the country's fledgling democracy, Chief of
Defence Staff Rear Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi has said.
</P>
<P>
Ogohi was quoted as saying in a statement in the capital Abuja
Friday that the declaration was necessary given recent
developments in the country and rumors that the armed forces were
interested in seizing power.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces were determined to restore their battered
image and prove their patriotism not only to their compatriots but
also the world at large, said the military chief, adding they
would defend democracy at all costs from the barracks. "We will
never abandoned our constitutional responsibility to the people of
our dear country Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it should also be noted that the military
forces were very determined in their effort to restore the
shattered military image in Nigeria, especially to prove to fellow
Nigerians that their patriotism was unquestionable and to show the
rest of the world that "we can protect our democracy as in more
developed countries".
</P>
<P>
The recent widespread rumors that the Nigerian armed forces
would probably overthrow the civilian government compelled the
military forces to clear the air again on its unreserved loyalty
to this elected administration, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Banks Urged to Request Police Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police Saturday urged the
banking institutions throughout the country to request police
deployment immediately in view of the fact that there have been
several armed robberies of banks in the country in broad daylight
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka Province division commanding officer Bernard Mayonda
made the appeal here, saying there is need for tight security at
banks because there are a lot of bandits walking about the streets
looking for money.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police service could not deploy its officers
without request of the institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mayonda commended the banks that have already requested the
deployment of police forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police have not yet arrested anyone in
connection with the bank robbery which took place in Lusaka about

<HEADLINE> White Community Provocative Towards Black Governments: Nujoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma has
described a majority of the white community leaving in southern
Africa as very provocative towards the black governments.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma made the remarks at the end of a meeting on the
situation prevailing in Zimbabwe regarding the land issue Friday
night in the resort town of Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, South African President Thabo Mbeki and Mozambican
President Joachim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president said it was surprising that the same
people who had oppressed blacks in the continent for a long time
were now saying black governments were not observing the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mbeki told reporters that the land imbalance in his
country was worse than in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said 80 percent of the productive land was in the hands of
whites while blacks had access to only 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
"However, responses to correct the issue are different from
Zimbabwe in the sense that the development of the rest of the
economy has resulted in our people being interested in other
sectors," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also denied speculation from certain quarters that his
country would generate funds to resolve the land issue in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the British government and other donors who pledged to
fund the program in 1998 should do that.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Closer China-Greece Parliamentary Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin expressed his hope on Saturday that the cooperative ties
between the legislatures of China and Greece will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Greek Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis in
Athens that China has always attached great importance to the
development of friendly cooperative relations with Greece, and
that he is satisfied with the smooth development of bilateral
exchanges and cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that China welcomes more cooperation between its
legislature, the National People's Congress, and the Greek
parliament, and more visits to China by the Greek deputies and
personnel of various circles to increase their knowledge of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also hoped for the promotion of mutual understanding and
expansion of bilateral cooperation by encouraging all-level
contacts in different fields of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kaklamanis extended his warm welcome to Jiang, who
is in Greece for a four-day state visit, the first by a Chinese
head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between China and Greece in June 1972.
</P>
<P>
The speaker expressed his belief that Jiang's visit will
strengthen cooperation between the two governments and the two
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang held separate talks with the leader of
Greece's main opposition New Democracy, Costas Karamanlis,
Communist Party Secretary General Aleko Papariga and President of
the Coalition of the Left Nikos Constantopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Praising these parties for their roles in the smooth
development of Chinese-Greek ties, Jiang hoped that they will make
greater contributions to the development of bilateral ties in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the fourth leg of Jiang's ongoing five-nation tour,
which has already taken him to Israel, Palestine and Turkey.
Before his visit to Turkey, Jiang flew from Palestine to Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria for a brief meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in Greece, Jiang will travel on to South Africa
for his first-ever visit to the country.

SHENYANG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- People from the Chinese mainland,
Taiwan region and the United States will celebrate general Zhang
Xueliang's 100th birthday next month in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was instrumental in arresting the Communist Party of
China's rival Chiang Kai-shek in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
According to the China-based Zhang Xueliang Foundation, this is
the first time that people from the mainland, Taiwan region and

<P>
Zhang and General Yang Hucheng arrested Chiang Kai-shek, leader
of the Kuomintang, in the famous Xi'an Incident on December 12,
1936.
</P>
<P>
Chiang was released unharmed after negotiations in which Zhou
Enlai played a crucial role. However, Zhang was imprisoned by
Chiang, and spent decades under house arrest in Taiwan under the
Kuomintang.

"If China joins WTO, all vacant houses will be sold out in five
years," said Huang Qifan, deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai
Municipal People's Government, and chairman of Shanghai Economic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"In ten years, Pudong may need more buildings," he told Xinhua
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area Administrative Committee said there are
dozens of firms and residents moving into Pudong everyday.

Half of the office buildings and 40 percent of residential
quarters in Pudong are vacant. Over the past decade, apartment
buildings with some 29 million square meters of floor space went
up in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that real estate developers built too many
buildings in 1992-1994. Real estate developers also overestimated
the number of companies planning to invest in Pudong, despite the
fact that one-fifth of the world's 500 largest companies have set
up subsidiaries in the area.

overseas investors, with housing property prices 60 percent lower,
causing real estate sales to stagnant for a period of time in
Pudong.

<HEADLINE> Pudong's Real Estate Market Picking up (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news of China's expected entry into WTO has triggered off a
new wave of investment from both at home and abroad. For instance,
the Wanxiang Real Estate Group, based in east China's Zhejiang
Province, invested 50 million U.S. dollars in developing luxury
office buildings in the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone in the
heart of Pudong.
</P>
<P>
At percent, more than 80 percent of buildings in Lujiazui,
where China is to build a Financial Center, have been sold out or
leased.
</P>
<P>
Prices of residential quarters are also picking up along with
the improvement of infrastructure facilities. While housing prices
in Shanghai are generally going down, those in Pudong are rising.
In January, housing prices in Pudong went up 5.57 percent over the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developer Wei Ping, head of the Tian'en Garden,
said that a number of film stars and anchorpeople are purchasing
houses in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
As Pudong's economy develops rapidly, more and more people are
moving into the area. It is predicted that population in the 522-
square-kilometer area will rise from 1.5 million to three million
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Pudong began developing on April 18, 1990 when the central
government announced that China would open up and develop the area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Pudong's economic growth has taken the
lead in China. Gross domestic product rose from six billion yuan (
about 720 million U.S. dollars) in 1990 to 80 billion yuan in 1999,
up 21 percent annually on average.
</P>
<P>
Hua Xinxiang, an official at the Pudong New Area Administrative
Committee, said that Pudong's economy will continue to develop
vigorously in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"Bubble economy does not exist in Pudong as it occurred in some
southeastern Asian nations," Hua said, adding that "We have strong
industries here."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Journalist Jailed for Attending Berlin Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's prominent reformist
journalist Akbar Ganji was jailed on Saturday for attending a
controversial conference in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Ganji, a member the editorial board of reformist daily Fatah
(conquer) was sent to prison following several hours of
interrogation and being informed of 10 complaints lodged against
him, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps, the hard-line Kayhan daily, the security forces (police),
the Headquarters for Enjoining the Good and Prohibiting the Evil
and families of 13 martyrs lodged complaint against him in
connection with the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
Ganji became famous among journalists after he wrote a series of
stories about and urged authorities to find out the real
masterminds behind the serial political killings of opposition
leaders and dissident writers late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ganji was detained after over 140 members of the Iranian
outgoing conservative Majlis (parliament) on Wednesday called on
the judiciary to bring to justice the Iranian reformists who
attended the conference in Berlin last week.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have arranged various rallies and demonstrations
throughout the country in recent days denouncing the Berlin
conference, by the Heinrich Boell Foundation on Iran after the
February parliamentary elections, in which reformists won an
overwhelming victory over the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were accused of advocating the U.S.-style reforms
in Iran at the conference, which was disrupted by members of
outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) who accused the
Iranian government of "crimes and human rights violations" in Iran
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The conference organizer had invited some close allies and
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, including reformist
cleric Yussefi Eshkevari and reformist journalist Akbar Ganji.
</P>
<P>
Iranian conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive organs
but suffered a series of setbacks in elections during the past two
years, said that the Berlin conference was religiously prohibited
and the judiciary has assigned the revolutionary court to probe the
case against Iranian participants.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformists defended the Berlin conference and accused
the conservatives of trying to use the conference as a pretext to
stop the new reformist-dominated parliament from meeting and
undermining Khatami's reform programs.

Approximately one million illegal foreign workers are estimated
to be employed in Turkey.
</P>
<P>

Turkey's fast-growing hygiene and cleaning paper products sector
and will allow Viking to expand its operations and increase exports

COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rebels of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) claimed Saturday they had overrun a
strategic military complex in northern Jaffna peninsula after two
days of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass bases forming the giant military
complex of the Sri Lankan army on the gateway to Jaffna fell to
the combat formations of the Liberation Tigers this afternoon,"
said the rebels in a statement from their London office.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate comment from the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The rebel statement said more than 1,000 government soldiers
were killed on Saturday but did not give their own casualties.
</P>
<P>
"The conquest of Elephant Pass complex, the largest and well-
entrenched military base in the north, signified a major military
victory of the Tigers in the current campaign against Sri Lankan
troops in Jaffna," the LTTE said.
</P>
<P>
It said the fall of this crucial base at the gate of Jaffna
will facilitate the LTTE to gain its strategic goal of retaking
their former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have intensified
their offensives since late March around Iyakachchi and the
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clashes in northern Sri Lanka came amid moves by
Norway to bring the LTTE and the government here to the
negotiating table. Both sides have agreed to Norwegian involvement,
but dates for direct talks have not been agreed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senator's Plot to Impeach Obasanjo Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Nobel literature laureate
Wole Soyinka has added his voice to a national condemnation of an
attempt by maverick senator Arthur Nzeribe to impeach President
Olusegun Obasanjo after his only one year in office.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka said here on Friday that Nzeribe was only seeking
attention, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing else he is looking for except attention, so
don't give it to him. Ignore him," said the renowned playwright.
</P>
<P>
Nzeribe Monday circulated a 15-point petition accusing Obasanjo
of nepotism, disregard for the constitution and the awarding of
oil contracts to his "cronies and kinsmen."
</P>
<P>
Nzeribe followed up with a senate appearance that caused a stir
on Tuesday, when fellow angry senators almost tore him apart. But
he insisted the president had a case to answer and that he had the
right under the constitution to press for it.
</P>
<P>
In a rare show of solidarity, politicians of the opposition
Alliance for Democracy Thursday marched to the office of the
Lagos State Governor Ahmed Bola Tinubu, urging him to initiate a
law declaring Nzeribe persona-non- grata in the state.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo himself has shrugged off the impeachment threat,
telling journalists: "I am fine."
</P>
<P>
The senate has meanwhile referred Nzeribe's petition to its
committee on privileges and public petition for possible
discussion after the Easter holidays.

<HEADLINE> UNDP on Relationship Between Poverty, Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's poverty reduction is a
pre- condition for the success of health reforms against poverty,
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its Human Development Report for Zimbabwe for 1999 released
here, the UNDP said poverty, which had worsened since the late
1980s, was one of the strongest factors in the prevalence of
various infectious and non- infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty has a direct bearing on the health status of people
and causes an increase in sick people. Health is thus a factor in
sound economic development. At the same time, a prosperous
society promotes the health status of the population," it said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said the two-way relationship between health and
economic developments suggested that poverty reduction was a
pre-condition for the success of health reforms against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been experiencing high levels of poverty in the
urban and rural areas and the situation has been worsened by the
increasing economic crisis which has seen companies closing down
and large-scale retrenchments.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Finally to Reunite With Father Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Services (INS) removed by force the six-year-old
Cuban shipwreck survivor from his relatives' home in Little Havana,
Miami, early on Saturday, and the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is
expected to reunite with his son at the Andrews Air Force Base
soon.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who arrived in Washington for taking custody of his
son on April 4, has gone to the airport for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
A group of INS agents arrived at the house of the Miami
relatives shortly after 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) to knock and kick on the
door. A short time later, Elian Gonzalez was brought out of the
home by a woman agent, put into a van and whisked away. The boy
was then put on a airplane heading to Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno told a press conference that
Elian is safe. She stressed that the government tried every way it
could to get the family of the Miami relatives to surrender the
boy, before taking the action, but the negotiations failed and the
family refused to turn over the boy.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the paramount concern for the morning's raid was the
safety of the child.
</P>
<P>
She said eight federal agents were in the house and one female
agent picked up Elian. She spoke with him in Spanish. The whole
process lasted for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton approved the pre-dawn raid to seize
the boy, his spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was kept informed throughout the night of the progress
of the negotiations between the Justice Department and Gonzalez's
relatives, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
After being told by his chief of staff John Podesta that all-
night negotiations to resolve the custody dispute failed, Clinton
said that he was disappointed and gave the go-ahead for seizing
Elian from the Miami home of his great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"The president was pleased the boy was safe and going to be
reunited with his father," Lockhart said, adding that the
president had no plans to meet with Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
The father expressed his gratitude to the U.S. authorities. "We
are grateful to the attorney general and the Department of Justice
for upholding the law with utmost concern for the safety and well-
being of Elian Gonzalez," the father's attorney, Greg Craig, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general was tireless. She was insistent that we
continue our effort to achieve a peaceful and voluntary transfer
of custody."
</P>
<P>
"We too are sad that force was required, but to the very end
Lazaro Gonzalez placed road blocks in the path of an orderly
transfer of custody. He gave the attorney general no alternative."
</P>
<P>
Craig said the boy is in good spirits on the airplane and eager
to be reunited with his family.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that the Justice Department will abide by an appeals
court rule that the boy will remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck in the
Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned
when their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, the INS ruled that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba. However, the Miami
relatives insist the boy should stay with them in the United
States.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sydney residents had been told
to change their coummuting habits during the Olympic Games to
ensure the Games run somoothly, according to reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice-president Anita DeFrantz said that while the
foundation for Sydney's public transport system during the Games
was in place, it was up to the city's residents to ensure its
efficiency.
</P>

"It's going to require people to change their daily habits,"
DeFrantz was quoted as saying. "It may mean getting up a little
earlier and going to work, it may mean going to work a little bit
later or perhaps going to work at a different time or going on
vacation."
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz is in Sydney heading a three-member delegation of the
IOC's transport working group.
</P>
<P>
She suggested Sydneysiders stay off public transport at peak

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 billion yuan (9.64
billion U.S. dollars) is spent annually for fighting pollution in

percent of China's GDP, the highest input among all developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
There is unprecedented attention being paid to protecting the
environment, he said, adding that the central government has
listed environmental protection as one of the most important tasks
in its drive to develop the country's western regions.

more than 40 non-governmental environmental protection
organizations engaged in improving the environment and spreading
public awareness.

<HEADLINE> Final Israeli Pullout From West Bank To Be Discussed Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian sources asserted that a
meeting will be held on Sunday between chief Palestinian
negotiator, Saeb Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran to
discuss the last phase of the Israeli pullout from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources quoted by the daily "Alayam" on Saturday
did not disclose the venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Israel has proposed to implement a part of
the troops redeployment before this month, including some
Palestinian villages near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources pointed out that this proposal has not
been approved yet, since it will be the focus of the meeting held
between the two sides during this week.
</P>
<P>
Under Oslo agreement, Israel should withdraw its troops from all
West Bank and Gaza except Jerusalem , the settlements, and the
military areas before the start of the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks went on for almost six months, including
two rounds of talks held in Washington, but the two sides did not
make any progress on the issues of Jerusalem, borders, refugees,
and the settlements owing to the wide gap between their stances.
</P>
<P>
After the talks held Thursday in Washington between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and the U.S. President Bill Clinton, it was
declared that the third round of the final status talks will be
held on April 30 in Eilat, and will be attended by the U.S peace
coordinator, Dennis Ross, in a bid to help reach a frame agreement
by next month.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Palestinian delegation in the negotiations, Yasser
Abed Rabbo, said next moves will be decided during this round,
while Erekat stated that another round may be required to reach a
frame accord.
</P>
<P>
During Washington summit , Clinton assured Arafat that the U.S
will play a greater role and will exert all its efforts to push
ahead the peace process to help the Israeli and the Palestinian
sides achieve a lasting peace by September.

<HEADLINE> Name of Iranian Higher Education Ministry Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The name of Iran's Ministry of
Culture and Higher Education has officially been changed into the
Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the measure was to pave the way for some
structural changes that are to be made in this ministry, said the
agency, adding that Mostafa Moin will remain the head of the new
ministry.
</P>
<P>
In a session here Saturday attended by officials of the
ministry, President Mohammad Khatami was briefed on the activities
and responsibilities of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Cooperatives Minister Morteza Haji revealed
that President Khatami had started reviewing the performances of
his ministers in order to reshuffle his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government also has plans to merge the Agriculture Ministry
with the Construction Jihad Ministry and the Industries Ministry
with the Ministry of Mines and Metals.
</P>
<P>
But on April 13, Iran's moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani, who is also government spokesman,
denied reports that Khatami were planning to reshuffle the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani was impeached by the conservative parliament last
year for his support for press freedom. But he survived.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been clouded by political tension since the sensitive
sixth parliamentary elections in February, in which reformers
allied to President Khatami dealt a severe blow to the
conservatives by bagging more than 75 percent of the total 290
seats.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Attacks Rebel Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government army
Saturday attacked a camp of Muslim rebels in Basilan Province, the
Southern Philippines, in an attempt to rescue a group of hostages
taken by the rebels a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN television quoted an army official as saying that
about 500 soldiers attacked 250 Abu Sayyaf rebels with cannons and
mortars in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the decision to start the military
operations was taken by a provincial crisis management committee
after the rebels claimed to have beheaded two of 29 hostages.
</P>
<P>
But the local television also quoted the rebels as warning that
they would begin beheading the remaining five male hostages if the
government army continues its rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said that nine government soldiers were killed in
the morning fighting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the rebel group said they beheaded two male teachers
Wednesday as the government had rejected their demands for the
release of two Abu Sayyaf members and others, including Ramzi
Yousef who masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center
in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels took away about 50 people from two
schools in Basilan on March 20 as human shields after attacking a
government army post, but later they released some of them.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Illegal Chicks Bound for Congo Destroyed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Three thousand chicks illegally en
route to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from South Africa
have been set ablaze by the Zambian Veterinary Department after
being seized from Ndola Airport in its Copperbelt Province on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day old chicks which were packed in 30 carton boxes
were spread with formalin to suffocate them before they were set
alight in Itawa township on Friday, Saturday's Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Francis Mulenga, principal veterinary officer in
charge of Copperbelt and North-Western provinces, as saying the
importer of the chicks, Kim Poultry of Lubumbashi in the DRC, did
not have documentation to allow it to transit through Zambia and
risked spreading the deadly new castle disease which is fatal in
chickens.
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to be harsh on anyone, we are trying to
protect our industry and more over the law requires one to get
papers," Mulenga said.
</P>
<P>
He said the department did not know about the illegal
importation of the chicks and that what raised suspicion about Kim
Poultry was its usage of a Zambian registered vehicle to ferry the
chicks to Lubumbashi, but they could have been diverted anywhere
within Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kim Poultry did not have a stock movement permit authorized by
the Veterinary Department, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Alert Evacuates Supermarket in Brittany, France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A supermarket of the Carrefour
chain stores in Brittany, western France, had to be evacuated on
Saturday after receiving a bomb alert, days after a blast killed a
woman employee in a McDonald's restaurant in the same region.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary gendarmerie said an anonymous phone call said
late in the morning that a bomb would blow up the supermarket in
half an hour, forcing the store to evacuate hundreds of customers
shopping for the Christian Easter this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Police cordoned off the store while fire brigades and
paramilitary police began checking the huge surface of the market
in Saint-Brieuc-Langueux.
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, another McDonald's restaurant in France came
under attack as a fire accident broke out at dawn Saturday at a
children's playground belonging to the restaurant near Bayonne in
the Basque region in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the arsonists apparently were inspired by
Wednesday's bombing attack, which has made McDonald's top news in
France this week.
</P>
<P>
A militant Brittany group called "Brittany Revolutionary Army (
ARB)" is the number one suspect in Wednesday's attack.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, police also suspect the ARB had provided the Spanish
Basque separatist group ETA with logistic support.
</P>
<P>
French police recently arrested a 26-year-old woman militant of
ETA in the French Basque region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laurence Turbec, a 27-year-old woman employee of
McDonald's who was killed in the Wednesday's attack, was buried in
a private funeral on Saturday in her hometown in Lehon, Brittany.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry into WTO will Speed up Tourism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has more than 6,000 travel agencies, of which 1312 are
qualified to organize tours for overseas tourists coming to China.
But many of them are small and lack an efficient operation system.
</P>
<P>
Wei brushed aside worries of the possible shut-down of many
small travel agencies, saying that it is not totally a bad thing.
"At least this will warn other travel agencies that they either
improve their business and services or face the possibility of
being shut-down," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even if all the 1312 international travel agencies are forced
to set up joint-ventures with overseas competitors, China's
international tourism revenue will still make profits as long as
overseas tourists coming to China increase by 1 million a year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, China's tourism has grown steadily, especially in
the international sector. Statistics indicate that in 1999,
overseas arrivals reached 72 million, with revenue from
international tourism reaching 11.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, international tourism
in China continued to climb. During this period, China received
more than 19 million overseas tourists and earned over 3.6 billion
US dollars, an increase of 15.2 percent and 17.7 percent over the
same 1999 period respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the expansion of China's tourism largely goes to
its unique tourism resources.

<P>
DALIAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to The World
Trade Organization will exert a positive impact on the country's
tourism sector and will also create huge opportunities for its
development.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by an official of the China National
Tourism Administration at the China Scenic Spot and Resort
Exhibition in this northeast China port city of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism industry emerged with the adoption of the
country's reform and opening up policy in late 1978, Since then,
the tourism industry has been developing rapidly, said Wei Xiao'an,
director of CNTA's Planning and Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
Almost every sector of tourism has opened up to foreign
businesses, except the travel service agencies, where only several
Sino-overseas joint-ventures have been approved. "This means that
China's tourism sector is well aware of overseas competition," Wei
said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that as overseas businesses break into the Chinese
domestic market, competition will be acute. This will prompt
domestic companies to make travel operations more efficient in
accordance with international standard.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei pointed out that if overseas travel services
successfully break into the Chinese market, they may take away a
considerable share from China's international tourism market. This
would mean the shut-down of many small domestic travel services
engaging international tourism industry and foreign currencies
leaving the country.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Traditional Medicine Vital to Health of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
has played a vital role in safeguarding the health of the Chinese
people who make up one fourth of the world's population, according
to the State Administration of TCM.
</P>
<P>
A national survey of some 80,000 residents show that 44 percent
of Chinese prefer TCM therapy or the treatment integrated with
Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,800 hospitals and more clinics
specializing in traditional medicine nationwide, as well as some
510,000 medical professionals who received 150 million outpatient
last year and provided hospitalization service to 2.87 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Medical professionals also undertake the task of disease
prevention during disaster relief, health promotion, health care
in urban communities and health education.
</P>
<P>
In the vast rural areas, the home to over 800 million Chinese,
some 50,000 township hospitals and 730,000 village clinics using
TCM therapies provide one third of outpatient services and one
fourth of hospital treatments. More than half of village doctors
use herbal medicines while prescribing chemical drugs.
</P>
<P>
So far, the amount of TCM medicine producers has surpassed 1,
000, or one sixth of the country's total pharmaceutical firms,
which produce more than 8,000 kinds of drugs each year.
</P>
<P>
Some major breakthroughs have been made by Chinese researchers
in the treatment of health-threatening diseases, including cardio
and cerebral vascular illnesses, cancer, and hepatitis through TCM
therapy and the integrated treatment of the TCM and the western
medicine.

<HEADLINE> 33 Tamil Rebels Killed in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry
Saturday said government troops killed at least 33 Tamil rebels on
Friday in fresh fighting in the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In Lyakachchi on Friday afternoon, government troops killed
more than 20 rebels and wounding many others. Two soldiers were
killed and 31 others injured, ministry spokesman Rp Witana said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning in Arialai Tongue, the troops, supported by
artillery fire, killed at least 12 Tamil rebels, Witana said.
</P>
<P>
In another incident on the same day in Dohiwatta, troops
conducted a search and clearing operation and killed one terrorist.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels are engaged in an offensive aimed at taking
control of Jaffna Peninsula, their stronghold until government
troops recaptured it in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main target of the rebels, who have been fighting a war
against the government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the country, now appears to be Elephant Pass,
the main road link between the peninsula and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched their operation code-named Oyantha Alaikal
at Elephant Pass last December.
</P>
<P>
Witana said government troops now locked in fierce fighting
with the rebels in various places in the north and east killed at
least 66 rebels and injured a large number of others from April 16
to 21.

ISLAMABAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has attracted a total
of 392.8 million U.S. dollars of private foreign investment (PFI)
in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, a net
increase of 18.9 million dollars over the same period of last

<HEADLINE> More Ugandan People Use Condom to Prevent AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Condoms have been widely used in
Uganda over the past five years, which have contributed much to
the sharp decline of HIV/AIDS prevalence in the east African
country, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rate of men who use condoms to guard against HIV/AIDS
skyrocketed from seven percent to 40 percent, and the proportion
of women who use family planning methods also grew from 13 percent
to 21 percent during the 1995-99 period, according to an
evaluation survey by the Delivery of Improved Service for Health
project (DISH) in the country.
</P>
<P>
The DISH project has contributed to improvement in health
habits to more than seven million men, women and children in
Uganda, said Dish project country director Cheryl Letternma during
the launching of the second phase work plan for Rakai district.
</P>
<P>
She said that women in the DISH operational area, who give
birth with the aid of doctors or qualified mid-wives, shot up from
55 percent to 64 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Population in the DISH project areas who have gone for HIV
blood tests, has increased from one percent to 21 percent and one
percent to 15 percent among men and women respectively, Letternma
said.
</P>
<P>
The project intends to continue supporting health services in
the operational areas, especially in the field of reproductive and
maternal health including children and family planning, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Agents Remove Cuban Boy From Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
said on early Saturday that the six-year-old Cuban boy, Elian
Gonzalez, had been safely removed from the home of the boy's
relatives in Miami and was on his way to a reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department made the announcement in a brief
statement after the agents of the Immigration and Naturalization
Services (INS) snatched the boy from the house of the family in
Little Havana, Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted witnesses as saying that the agents
arrived at the house shortly after 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) to knock and
kick on the door. A short time later, Elian was brought out of the
home by a woman agent, put into a van and whisked away.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are gathering in front of the house of the
Miami relatives and more are expected to swarm into the streets.
</P>
<P>
The boy was flown to the Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington to reunite with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who
has arrived in the United States on April 6 for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
The INS said the agents are explaining to Elian what happened.
Elian is said to be subdued and calm. He's been given a play kit
that includes toys, Play-Doh, a toy plane, a map and a watch.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno had a 15-minute
meeting with the father at the Justice Department, but she refused
to set a timetable for reuniting Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
Reno, having exhausted almost all options, also had some
consultations with the White House late on Friday and discussed
the ways to make the boy transferred to his father.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, strongly backing the boy's reunion with
his father, said Thursday that Elian should be promptly and
orderly reunited with his father, adding that there is "no
conceivable argument" to keep Elian and his father apart after a
federal appeals court ruled the boy cannot leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be reunited with his son. That is the law
and the main argument of the family in Miami for not doing so has
now been removed," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the boy's father asked Americans to write to
Clinton and Reno to pressure them to reunite him with Elian.
</P>
<P>
"The court has now said he shouldn't go back to Cuba. The
Justice Department agrees with that and he (the father) has agreed
to that so there now is no conceivable argument for his not being
able to be reunited with his son," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck in the
Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned
when their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, the INS ruled that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba. However, the Miami
relatives insist the boy should stay with them in the United
States.

WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The laptop computer missing from the State Department
contained thousands of classified documents about arms
proliferation issues, including highly sensitive information about
the sources and methods of U.S. intelligence collection, State
Department officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- The lower house of the Russian parliament endorsed the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on Friday, strengthening acting
President Vladimir Putin's hand on arms control six weeks before a
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A Justice Department prosecutor investigating campaign fund-
raising improprieties conducted a wide-ranging interview with
President Bill Clinton on Friday that included questions about
electronic messages that were improperly handled by the White
House. The prosecutor interviewed Vice President Al Gore on
Tuesday, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The Russian Coast Guard fired on and seized a Japanese
fishing boat near Japan's northernmost main island, according to
officials on both sides. The countries have had disputes about
maritime boundaries and the possession of a number of small
islands in the region.

<HEADLINE> Ford Motor To End Production At Dagenham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) - Ford Motor Co, the world's second
largest auto maker, is set to announce the end of car production
at its Dagenham plant in Britain, putting 3,000 jobs at risk, it
is reported.
</P>
<P>
The move will be announced in mid-May as part of a major
restructuring that will affect other Ford European plants,
according to the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
Intense price competition, the strength of the pound abroad and
surplus capacity have undermined the competitiveness of Ford's
operations in Britain, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In February, Ford axed 1,500 jobs at Dagenham, its largest
British plant, and warned it could take further steps to turn
around its loss-making European car business.
</P>
<P>
The termination of car production at Dagenham, that employs
more than 7,700 people, is another blow to the British motor
industry, resulting from the expected loss of thousands of jobs
when BMW sells ailing Rover.
</P>
<P>
Ford declined to comment on the future of car assembly at
Dagenham plant, but told the paper that an announcement would be
made in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dagenham's future has been in doubt for months. Managers have
criticized poor productivity and the plant has been hit by
unofficial strikes and allegations of work force racism.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Speaker in Saudi Arabia to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Kuwait's National
Assembly Jassem Al-Khorafi arrived in the Saudi capital of Riyadh
Saturday for a three-day visit to boost cooperation between
parliaments of the two gulf nations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khorafi will meet with the head of the Saudi Shura
(Consultative) Council and Saudi government officials in Riyadh and
the western Saudi city of Jeddah, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first to Saudi Arabia by Al-Khorafi since he was
elected the Speaker in July last year, is in the "framework of
increasing cooperation, exchanging views and expertise in the
parliamentary field, and in democratic practice" in both countries,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the only Gulf Arab country that has an elected
parliament, while Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf states of
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are maintaining
a consultative system.
</P>
<P>
In early 1992, Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz decided to
establish the Saudi Shura Council and named Sheikh Mohammed Bin
Ibrahim Bin Jubair as the chairman of the consultative body. The
council does not exercise legislative power of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kuwait news agency on Friday, Bin
Jubair underlined the importance of the visit of the Kuwaiti
parliament delegation to exchange opinion in the parliamentary
affairs and democratic practices.
</P>
<P>
He described the Kuwaiti parliamentary experience as "unique."
</P>
<P>
Bin Jubair also voiced support for the idea of forming a Gulf
parliament union, noting that the "existence of the current
consultative councils in the Gulf Arab states needs to be
developed." But he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Bombard Hits School in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli forces bombed several
villages in south Lebanon Saturday morning and the shell hit a new
school in the village of Ibgeen, People's Voice radio station
reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report on casualties after the raids.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas fired 10
Katyushas to two Israeli positions at Blaat and Tal Halfa in west
sector of south Lebanon. The Israeli radio confirmed the attacks
from guerrillas but did not release any damage result.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces and the resistance guerrillas
intensified fightings after Israel formally notified the United
Nations that it would pullout its troops from south Lebanon by
July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak noted last week that his
country will harshly retaliate if the guerrillas continue firing
Katyushas to north Israel or cause any casualties after the Israeli
troops' withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 saying it needed to protect its
northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since then been leading a war of
attrition to end the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Growing Below Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
currently growing below its actual potential, Finance Ministry
Adviser Mustapa Mohamed said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have a long-term potential of growing at 7.0 percent a year.
Our task is to work harder to realize this potential," he told a
seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy has recovered since the second half of last
year. In the 2000 Budget re-tabled last February, Malaysia's GDP
is projected to expand by 5.8 percent this year, an upward target
from 5.0 percent set earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The 5.8 percent growth estimated for this year is well below
our actual capacity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has worked hard towards national
economic betterment by implementing various measures and

percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER), the
country's leading economic think-tank, has forecast the GDP growth
at 6.0 percent this year in a report released earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Suspends Permit for Foreign Workers Recruitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has decided to
suspend the issuance of permits for the recruitment of foreign
workers, Home Ministry Secretary-General Jamaluddin Haji Ahmad
Damanhuri said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken as the ministry is studying the situation
with regard to the recruitment of foreign workers in all sectors,
Haji said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
For applications which were already approved, he added,
employers could continue to go to the Immigration Department
Headquarters to pay levy and other charges for obtaining visa
approvals needed for foreign workers to be brought into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers decided on
February 28 that the Home Ministry would stop accepting new
applications for the recruitment of foreign workers for the time
being as it was still processing a large number of applications
submitted earlier.
</P>
<P>
By February this year, there were 697,219 legal foreign workers
in Malaysia, with 517,766 of them from Indonesia, 129,000 from
Bangladesh, 30,500 from Philippines, 3,280 from Pakistan, 2,888
from Thailand and the balance from other countries, according to
official figures.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Equip Hospitals, Health Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government plans to
equip all highway hospitals and other health facilities for
accident emergencies, Permanent Secretary Julius Meme for Health
Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Saturday quoted Meme as
saying the idea of equipping highway hospitals and health
facilities is to cope with the increasing road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Meme made the remarks in the capital Nairobi Friday when he
received the survivors of a bus-lorry head-on crash on Thursday
along the Nairobi- Mombasa Highway which killed 73 people.
</P>
<P>
The most targeted are those near known black spots along
Kericho road in Western Province and Nairobi-Mombasa Highway
including Voi's Moi Hospital, Kericho Hospital and Naivasha
Hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary noted that most hospitals had doctors
but lacking facilities to handle emergencies, saying his ministry
is sourcing for local and external donors for the project.
</P>
<P>
Due to speeding, overloading and ruthless driving, road
accidents in Kenya are seen on rise recently. On March 29, two
buses had a head-on collision in western Kenya, killing 76
passengers on board, the worst ever of its kind recorded in the
country.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of Russians who are HIV-
positive will exceed 1 million within two years, the Russian Anti-
AIDS Center said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Vadim Pokrovsky, head of the center, told the press
that AIDS has been spreading faster in Russia in recent years with
7,000 more HIV cases registered so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Pokrovsky predicted that the number of registered HIV cases
would exceed 300,000 by the year's end, which would be a two-fold
increase compared with last year's figures.
</P>
<P>
The number will reach 1 million in two years, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"They are mostly young people. As many as 80 percent of all HIV-
infected people are aged 15 to 25. That means an entire generation
is perishing here," Pokrovsky said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Police Removes Cuban Boy Away From Relatives by Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON,April 22 (Xinhua) -- The six-year-old Cuban
shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez was removed by U.S. federal
agents by force from the his relatives' home in Miami early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agents fired tear gas to the crowd as they left the house,
an Associated Press report quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the agents arrived at the house shortly
after 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) to knock and kick on the door. A short
time later, Elian was brought out of the home by a woman agent,
put into a van and whisked away.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of several hundred people were still gathering around
the house and emotions were high.
</P>
<P>
The boy was reportedly flown to Washington to reunite with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived in the United States on
April 6 for the reunion with his son.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno refused to set a
timetable for reuniting Elian with his father after meeting with
the latter.
</P>
<P>
After the 15-minute meeting at the Justice Department with
Gonzalez, Reno said in a short statement that she told him that "I
could not commit to a particular course of action or timetable."
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply moved by Mr. Gonzalez' evident love for his son...
I assured him I would continue working toward the goal of
reuniting him with his child," Reno said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the father expressed great concern for and requested
a quick reunion with the boy, who has been in the United States
for nearly five months since he survived in the Atlantic sea off
Florida. The boy's mother and 10 others were all drowned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as Reno, having exhausted almost all
options, was waiting for her law enforcement officials to
determine how to have the boy transferred to his father.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said Thursday that Elian should be
promptly and orderly reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters at the White House that there is "no
conceivable argument" to keep Elian and his father apart after a
federal appeals court ruled the boy cannot leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be reunited with his son. That is the law
and the main argument of the family in Miami for not doing so has
now been removed," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the boy's father asked Americans to write
to Clinton and Attorney General Reno to pressure them to reunite
him with Elian.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM: Development Needs to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Saturday said that all development-related
activities should be based on the concept of sustainable
development, taking into account the need to protect the
environment and maintain ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of 20 children on the "Earth Day 2000" at
his residence, Vajpayee said: "The most effective weapon against
pollution and environmental degradation is increasing
participation by the people and voluntary organizations."
</P>
<P>
Endorsing the concern of the children, who presented him a 13-
point 'Children's Manifesto on Clean Air," he said their charter
would be looked into and the government would take necessary steps
to reduce pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the efforts of the children for mobilizing public
opinion against environmental degradation and pollution, he said
his government had already taken several steps in this regard
including mandatory use of lead- and sulphur-free fuel, greater
controls on industrial waste disposal and public awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The children's manifesto urges the government to provide
cleaner fuels, an efficient public transport system and a ban on
diesel cars. It also calls for efforts to promote alternate fuels
and manage the chaotic traffic on the roads.
</P>
<P>
It urges automobile makers not to wait for court orders to
undertake pollution-reducing measures.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ruling Party Begins Race for Zanzibar Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian ruling Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) party has started its candidates nomination for
the Zanzibar Presidency, media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two prominent members of CCM, Transport and Communication
Minister Amani Abeid Karume and Ambassador Ahmed Hassan Diria,
Friday collected the nomination forms after being requested by CCM
elders.
</P>
<P>
Karume is the son of Zanzibar's founder President, the late
Abeid Karume, and Diria is chairman of the Tanzania Communications
Commission and former Foreign Affairs Minister.
</P>
<P>
Other CCM leaders expected to enter the Zanzibar Presidential
race include Vice-President Omar Ali Juma, retired President Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, Home Affairs Minister Mohamed Seif Khatib and
Zanzibar Chief Minister Dr. Mohammed Gharib Billal.
</P>
<P>
Further more, Speaker of the House of Representatives Ameir
Kificho, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office
(Information and Policy) Ali Ameir Mohamed, Finance Minister Amina
Salum Ali, and CCM Deputy Secretary General Mohamed Takrima are
also expected to join the race.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, including the main Unguja island and its sister
island of Pemba lying some 40 kilometers east of the mainland of
Tanzania, merged with the then Republic of Tanganyika in 1964 to
form the United Republic of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
But Zanzibar has its own government, president and parliament
dealing with affairs except foreign and defense ones.
</P>
<P>
Though the Union President Benjamin Mkapa, who is also chairman
of the CCM, seems to have no strong candidate from the opposition,
it is hard for the CCM to find a right candidate to defeat Seif
Shariff Hamad, candidate of Zanzibar's main opposition party Civic
United Front (CUF).
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 presidential elections, the outgoing CCM President
of Zanzibar Salmin Amour defeated Seif by a 51 to 49 percentage
margin.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will hold its second multi-party general elections on
October 29, this year to elect the Union President, Members of
Parliament and Zanzibar President, Members of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable issued by the National Election
Committee, the registration of voters will be conducted between
August 1 and 21 while nomination of contestants will be made on
August 13, and election campaigns between August 14 and October
28.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in the country's post-independence
history for presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 fully registered political parties including the
CUF which is the main opposition party in Zanzibar are expected to
start before May the primary elections, which are likely to be
dominated by the ruling CCM at least on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa, who won the 1995 elections, is expected to run
for his second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had a single political party, the CCM, from 1965 until
1992 when the multiparty system was introduced.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang, Seoul Hold First Preparatory Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Delegations from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea held their first
preparatory meeting at Panmunjom Saturday for an inter-Korean
summits scheduled to open on June 12-14, the Korean Central News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held in the Peace House just south of
the demilitarized zone bisecting the Korean Peninsula and runs
through Panmunjom, was attended by three representatives led by a
vice ministerial level official from each side.
</P>
<P>
Kim Ryong Song, head of the DPRK delegation, said that both
sides reaffirmed the three principles of national reunification
clarified in the July 4 joint statement.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides agreed to continue at the next
contact the discussion on the working procedural matters related
to the inter-Korean Pyongyang meeting and summit talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that this is an important event of landmark
significance in improving the inter-Korean relations and settling
the reunification issue as it reflects the nation's will and
aspiration for independence
</P>
<P>
It is beyond doubt that a successful holding of the projected
meeting and talks would open an epochal phase in achieving
national reconciliation and unity and bringing earlier peace and
reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a crucial breakthrough after a half-century of division,
Seoul and Pyongyang reached an agreement in Beijing on April 8,

<HEADLINE> Russia to Have Stable Food Supply in 2000: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia will harvest 70-80 million
tons of grain in 2000, which will keep the country safe from
serious food shortage, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir
Shcherbak told a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
As much as 7.5-8 percent of that amount will be lost in
processing and storing, but food supply will be stable in 2000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it would not be true to say that Russian agriculture
has come out of its crisis, and it would take years to recover
completely, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the spring sowing in Chechnya, Shcherbak said an area of 80,
000 hectares will be sown there although it would be cheaper to
transfer foodstuffs to the republic from outside because the
agricultural infrastructure and machinery in the province are in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, First Deputy Agriculture and Food Minister Anatoly
Mikhalyov said that Russia will not need the so-called big package
of U.S. food aid if 70-75 million tons of grain is harvested this
year as planned.
</P>
<P>
"The shipment to Russia of the last lot of U.S. maize, part of
the 1999 food aid program at an amount of 474,000 tons, is nearing
completion. At the end of May and in early June, 300,000 tons of
wheat from the so-called small package of U.S. food aid in 2000
will arrive and ease the situation on the Russian grain market
before a new harvest," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve Registration Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The work to directly elect
township people's deputies from November to February proved to be
no easy job, so Beijing vows to make it easier in the future.
</P>
<P>
Traditional way to register voters should be reformed and
greater efforts should be made to attract people to vote, said
Zhang Xuming, Director of the Sub-Committee of Internal Affairs of
the Standing Committee of the 11th Beijing Municipal People's
Congress (BMPC), said Friday on the last day of the standing
committee's two-day session.
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the country, Beijing registers its voters and
then defines constituencies on people's residence cards. However
with the development of the market economy, more and more
population shifts are taking place, and the registration of voters
has become one major headache for relevant officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicted that the difficulty will become even greater,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Although Zhang failed to suggest specific reform measures for
the already out-of-date way of registering voters, this is the
first time a leading BMPC official in charge of voter registration
suggested reform measures during a session of the BMPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, Voters' ignorance about the candidates'
background and what the candidates will do once they become people
's deputies have seriously dampened their enthusiasm about voting.
</P>
<P>
Although things did change for the better when the BMPC
Standing Committee began to promote city meetings between
candidates and voters in 1998, the meetings still needed to be
systematized and spread out further to be more effective.
</P>
<P>
"We should also step up publicity on the functions of the
system of People's Congress, and of the deputies," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has staged three direct elections since 1996, one for
people's deputies at the level of county and district and two for
those at the level of town and township. Participation rate was
over 95 percent. The rate for the one closed in February was 97.05
percent.
</P>
<P>
About 2.7 million voters from 224 suburban towns and townships
around Beijing produced altogether 11,677 new deputies for the
people's congresses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Pupils Work for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- About 300 Chinese and Japanese
pupils took to Beijing's major streets this morning in a joint
effort to advertise knowledge about environmental protection and
to mark World Earth Day today.
</P>
<P>
Pupils from 106 primary schools in the Chinese capital and
Japanese pupils from Japanese-run schools in Beijing were seen
giving out handouts to pedestrians on how to recycle different
kinds of wastes. They also showed samples of wastes they recently
collected.
</P>
<P>
Today's activity is part of the "Hand in Hand for Our Global
Village Program," a Japanese foundation-aided program launched in
1997. So far, Japan has assisted more than 200 primary schools in
Beijing and neighboring Hebei Province with wastes-collection
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 100,000 pupils in Beijing and their peers in
200 primary schools in other parts of the country have
participated in the activities of the program. They have used the
money they collected from selling the wastes to build four schools
in China's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the activities, including the State Environmental
Protection Administration, and the Chinese Children's News, said
they plan to attract about 2,000 primary schools nationwide to
contribute to the program.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government army
Saturday shelled a camp of Muslim rebels, who abducted 29 hostages
a month ago and claimed to have killed two of them, a local radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Radio Station DXRC said that government army shelled a camp of
Abu Sayyaf in the southern province of Basilan with cannons and
mortars early Saturday. But the government so far has not
confirmed the report.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group said they beheaded two male teachers Wednesday
as the government had rejected their demands for the release of
two Abu Sayyaf members and others, including Ramzi Yousef who
masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels took away about 50 people from two
schools in Basilan on March 20 as human shields after attacking a
government army post, but later they released some of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that if the radio report could be confirmed,
the army may start rescue operations soon.

<HEADLINE> Second Preparatory Meeting for Inter-Korean Summit to Open Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANMUNJOM, South Korea, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to
hold a second preparatory meeting for the agreed inter-Korean
summit on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the first preparatory meeting held
in the Peace House south of the truce village Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Seoul and Pyongyang agreed to hold the second
meeting at Tongilgak, a house north of the truce village, at 10 a.
m. local time (0100 GMT) next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Vice Unification
Minister Yang Young-shik, South Korea's chief delegate, said the
meeting was held in a very friendly atmosphere and the DPRK
delegation showed a very positive and pragmatic attitude.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides expressed their respective basic
stances on the agenda and procedures for the summit and agreed to
seek mutual development and prosperity through economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation reaffirmed the basic spirit of the
agreement signed by the two sides on April 8 this year for the
summit, saying that the forthcoming Pyongyang summit will address
a wide range of pending issues and create the momentum for
national unification.

<HEADLINE> China Draws Flood Control Plan for Northeast Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China has drafted an overall plan
to speed up flood control on Songhua and Nenjiang rivers to combat
floods such as those which roared downed the rivers in the summer
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the State Council, the country's highest
governing body, is scheduled to be implemented in the next ten
years with an estimated cost of 40-50 billion yuan (4.8 billion to
six billion U.S. dollars), Zhang Jiyao, vice-minister of water
resources said at a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The plan covers all sections of the two flood-prone rivers in
northeast China, but focuses on the protection of major targets in
that region," said the official, quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the targets will include major cities,
railways, oilfields and large rural areas downstream of the
proposed Ni'erji Reservoir on the Nenjiang River, Fengman
Reservoir on the tributary of the Songhua River and other parts of
northeast China along the mainstream of the Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important parts of the plan is to raise the
standards of anti-flood projects, protecting the area's largest
and most important cities and its industrial centers.
</P>
<P>
Plans are to raise the standard of projects shielding Harbin,
capital of Heilongjiang Province, from the 1994 state-set
criterion of being able to withstand the worst flood in every 100
years to the worst in every 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Anti-flood works in Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Songyuan and Daqing
will be upgraded to withstand the worst floods in 100 years
instead of the present capacity to withstand the worst floods in
50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, similar anti-flood schemes are expected to
be drafted soon to be improve flood-control systems along the rest
of China's major rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 summer floods, the worst since 1954 on the Yangtze in
central China and the most devastating one in northeast China,
shocked the government and the people.
</P>
<P>
The deluges hit some major sections of the two water systems in
northeast China's provinces. Their intensity was such that they
were only likely to occur once every 300 to 400 years, said
experts.
</P>
<P>
The new flood-control plan also includes comprehensive measures
to harness the two rivers and emphasize flood diversion projects,
with consideration given to improving flood water discharge
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The new plan will be based on the construction of levees and
dykes along the two rivers with the addition of some major
reservoirs. It will also include other engineering and non-
engineering projects, including water and soil-erosion control and
the protection of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Levees and dykes along the Songhua and its tributaries run for
about 16,000 km, with 4,245 km lining the mainstream of the river
and 1,272 km its tributaries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Falls to Lowest in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar has plunged to the lowest level in
six months, touching 8,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah traded at 7,875 per U.S. dollar (buying) and 8,000
rupiah per U.S. dollar (selling) in Saturday morning trade session.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the falling of rupiah to the slow progress
of the government's program for economic restructuring within the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
"The significant weakening of the rupiah not only reflects the
country's political uncertainty but also the structural issues and
the failure of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) instrument,"
the Bisnis Indonesia daily quoted an economist at the country's
private Bank Mandiri, Martin Panggabean as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said that on Thursday there was a 'huge buying'
as much as 10 million U.S. dollars on Singapore market by a U.S.
investment bank which triggered panic among local speculators.
</P>
<P>
But the dealer added that the falling of rupiah has been also
triggered by a huge demand of dollar from local industries,which
have to pay their debt due within this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Bank Indonesia (the central bank) said earlier
that private companies have to pay their foreign debt amounting to
29 billion U.S. dollars from January to December in 2000. This is
feared to influence the rupiah's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Economic Development
Council(DPUN) Sofyan Wanandi said the falling of the rupiah was
influenced by the country's current political condition.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many protests (against the government's policy)
. I think it has influenced the rupiah. We urge cabinet ministers
to pay more attention to their own task. We have to be serious in
handling the current economic situation and fasten the on-going
economic recovery," Wanandi said.
</P>
<P>
Early this week the rupiah was traded at 7,550 (buying) and 7,
675(selling) per U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Share in World Furniture  Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will try to
increase its present 1 percent market share in the 38 billion U.S.
dollar world furniture market through improvements in the country'
s science and technology system.
</P>
<P>
During the launching of the Furniture and Handicraft Research
and Development (R&AMP;D) Program here Thursday, Department of Science
and Technology Secretary Filemon Uriarte said that as the
Philippine furniture export revenue amounts to around 300 million
dollars a year,there is still an immense room for growth.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte said the R&AMP;D program for the furniture and handicraft
industries may help boost their export prospects, particularly of
the wood furniture industry which is among the export market's
fastest-growing sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The program is all about dreaming and doing big things for the
industry because there is still so much ground that we can cover,
a very large slice of the export pie that we can grab hold of," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the country's average furniture
export from 1994-1998 increased by 8 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the furniture export revenue amounted to 322 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A study found that the country's furniture and handicraft
export market potential is hindered by antiquated equipment,
insufficient supply of raw materials, comparable inferior products
and limited access to government support services.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte said the five-year R&AMP;D program is designed to remedy
these problems through research-based innovation system.  He said
that the Forest Products Research and Development Institute(FPRDI)
based in Los Banos, the Northern Philippines, will capitalize on
non-traditional wood and other forest materials to enhance
distinctive local design ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
It will also improve existing facilities and set up new
furniture training and testing centers in key points of the
country, he said.

<P>
KIEV, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
welcomed the Russian State Duma's ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the Russian parliament's
approval of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) II and the
CTBT would produce a positive influence on the process of nuclear
nonproliferation and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Ukraine, as one of the first countries
to sign the treaty, realized the importance of the CTBT and has
made substantial contributions to nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also hopes the Duma's ratification could encourage
other countries with nuclear weapons to approve the treaty as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma, the lower house of parliament, ratified the
treaty by a vote of 298 to 84 with two abstentions Friday.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was passed at the 50th U.N. Assembly in September 1996
and has been signed by 155 countries. Only 53 countries have

<HEADLINE> Federal Prosecutors Interview Clinton, Gore on Campaign Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Both U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were interviewed by federal
prosecutors on alleged fund-raising abuses in 1996, White House
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the vice president cooperated fully with the
task force and voluntarily agreed to be interviewed this week," a
statement from White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's interview, which was under oath and lasted four hours,
took place in the White House Friday, with White House counsel
Beth Nolan in attendance, along with Clinton's private lawyers
David Kendall and Nicole Seligman, an official said.
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor and four Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
agents conducted the interview, Clinton's third on campaign
finance. He was interviewed on November 11, 1997 and November 9,
1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A task force was established by Attorney General Janet Reno to
investigate allegations that illegal foreign and corporate
donations were made in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Gore was questioned for four hours Tuesday in the vice
presidential residence by Robert Conrad, head of the Justice
Department task force.
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to cooperate fully, as I have from the beginning
of their investigation," Gore said at a press conference on his
campaign plane returning to Washington from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not feel that the investigation will harm his
campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
Gore was questioned five times under oath involving various
investigations during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic presidential nominee was plagued by a fund-
rasing event at a Buddhist temple in California in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Countdown has started Friday
afternoon for Monday's launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis, and seven
astronauts for the mission have arrived at Kennedy Space Center in
Florida making the last preparations.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day space flight, aimed at preparing the International
Space Station for the arrival of Russia's Zvezda Service Module,
is scheduled to start on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters indicate a 70 percent chance for the launch.
</P>
<P>
As work to prepare Atlantis for launch continues, the
International Space Station continues to orbit the Earth as it
awaits the arrival of the seven-member crew, who will conduct
during the flight one spacewalk to perform maintenance on the
station and deliver logistics and supplies.
</P>
<P>
Crews normally train together for a year or more before launch,
but this crew was only finalized in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers in Kazakhstan have completed electrical
testing of the Zvezda Service Module.
</P>
<P>
The space shuttle features a new cockpit, technically called
the Multifunction Electronic Display Subsystem, which replaces
obsolete instruments and three monochrome computer screens with 11
full-color graphical displays.
</P>
<P>
The cockpit weighs less, uses less electricity, provides more
backup instruments and, most importantly, sets the stage for a
future "smart cockpit" now in development for the shuttle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurers Told to Improve Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese insurance official
has urged domestic insurance companies to revolutionize their
existing services to adapt to possible challenges in the wake of
China's accession into the World Trade Organization, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"They might be in a tight corner if they don't renew their
products at once," Wu Xiaoping, vice-chairman of China Insurance
Regulatory Commission, told participants at Thursday's symposium
on China's life insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, held at the Shanghai International
Convention Center, was sponsored by Fudan University and Financial
Times with major Chinese and foreign insurance companies
attendance.
</P>
<P>
The official told insurance firms to develop participating
insurance and unit-link insurance to resist the risks brought
about by the drop in bank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have suffered from seven drops in bank
interest rates in 1996, from 10.98 to 2.25 percent. "The drops
have driven many insurance companies into a corner," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance industry developed slowly and insurance
premiums increased at a low rate last year. Many companies have
found that if their fixed rate is higher than the bank rate they
will suffer from losses, but if they keep the same bank rate,
their policies will be hard to sell.
</P>
<P>
"Insurance companies should rely on themselves to expand their
life insurance business rather than depend on the government help,
" the official told participants.
</P>
<P>
China lags far behind Western countries and even some
developing countries in the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
The China Insurance Regulatory Commission has worked out a
development plan for China's life insurance industry in the next
five years, said Miao Fuchun, deputy general manager of the China
Life Insurance Company.

<HEADLINE> 11 Banks to Help Indonesia's Debt Restructuring </HEADLINE>

These nonperforming loans were owed by some 670 debtors.

IBRA's deputy chairman for asset management credit Irwan
Siregar said that the 11 banks would start working at the end of
May or early June.
</P>
<P>
"They will submit to us a loan restructuring proposal," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said the agency had appointed the 11 banks out of some
70 banks which participated in a tender to become the agency's
debt restructuring "agents".
</P>
<P>
He said another tender would be opened to appoint bank agents
to help in the restructuring of the loans.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we can appoint the bank agents by June," he added.
</P>
<P>
IBRA controls over 200 trillion rupiah (26.1 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of nonperforming loans received from closed down
banks, recapitalized banks and nationalized banks.
</P>
<P>
The agency has a mandate to restructure and recover the loans
in a bid to help finance the government's bank restructuring costs,
estimated at more than 500 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
IBRA has been criticized for its slow progress in the
restructuring of nonperforming loans, particularly large loans
owed by powerful businessmen.
</P>
<P>
IBRA is determined to take recalcitrant debtors to the
commercial court, but so far its earlier attempts have mostly
failed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set-up Special Anti-Corruption Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Attorney General
Office (AGO) will set up an anti-corruption team to curb rampant
corruption in the country, local leading newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Attorney General Marzuki Darusman as saying
that a former Supreme Court senior judge, Adi Andojo has been
appointed as the head of the team,
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said the team was established on the basis of a
government degree calling for the resolution of unsolved
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of the team was also part of the
country's effort to meet the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
demands that Jakarta be serious in handling corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
"The team will only deal with the investigation and prosecution
of corruption cases which are difficult to prove," Darusman added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of Corruption Affairs at the AGO Chairul
Imam was dismissed by Attorney General Marzuki Darusman on
Thursday "as a part of restructuring process within the AGO."
</P>
<P>
Marzuki defended his decision to dismiss Imam, saying that the
move formed part of an on-going internal process "to restructure
the AGO,boost professionalism, establish a good track record and
improve its performance."
</P>
<P>
But, the decision was criticized by some parliamentarians and
legal experts. They described the move as unsystematic and dubious
in nature.
</P>
<P>
However, some sources said the real reason for the dismissal
was that last week Imam issued a warrant for city arrest to
Indonesian former president Soeharto, rather than a house arrest
as preferred by the attorney general.

MEXICO CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's state oil company
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said Friday that 6,000 barrels of
crude were failed to be exploited daily from its Cerro de

peasants last Sunday morning.

Pemex spokesman Rodolfo Vizcaino Garcia told the press that the
local oil warehouse capacity has been saturated because the
blocked road is the only way to ship the crude by oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the peasants blocked the road because they
demanded the federal government pave a rural road that can link
about 100 communities.
</P>
<P>
Vizcaino said that Pemex plans to build an oil pipeline instead
of transporting oil by tank trucks from the Cerro Nanchital oil
field in the Las Choapas municipality.

ALMA-ATA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Asian countries of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed Friday a
treaty on jointly combating terrorism, religious extremism,
organized crime and other factors threatening regional security

</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, signed in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, by
presidents from the four nations, they will unite as one in
maintaining security and stability in Central Asia by taking
timely and effective steps to curb terrorism and extremism
threatening the region, the Central Asian Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
They will work closely together to fight against activities

religious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also stipulated that each of the Central Asian
countries adopt concrete measures to prevent the establishment in
their territory of terrorist bases and occurrences of any
terrorist acts directed against other nations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the signing of the treaty, Uzbek
President Islam Karimov spoke highly of the document, saying it is

the Central Asian nations to pool their strength in eliminating
elements menacing regional security."
</P>
<P>
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev echoed him, saying the
treaty serves as the nations' "best answer" to terrorism and
extremism. He described it as the most realistic step the

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia With Depleted Uranium Bombs Damages Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO dropped tens of thousands
of depleted uranium bombs on eight locations in Yugoslavia during
last year's airstrikes, causing widespread environmental damage, a
Yugoslav government report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by both Yugoslav and foreign experts, was
based on a yearlong study on the environmental effects of the NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of depleted uranium bombs banned by international
laws were dropped by NATO warplanes in southern part of Serbia and
Montenegro, which made the degree of radioactive contamination
there 1,000 times above the normal level, said Yugoslav Assistant
Defense Minister Slobodan Petkovich.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was much more exposed since depleted uranium bombs were
dropped on 100 locations, Petkovich added.
</P>
<P>
Nada Sljapic, minister for science and development, said that
NATO deliberately targeted chemical facilities during last year's
airstrikes, which was "a flagrant chemical warfare against human
environment."
</P>
<P>
NATO admitted last month that its warplanes had dropped 31,000
depleted uranium bombs, but argued that they did not present a
significant hazard to health or environment.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang Begin Preparatory Meeting for Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANMUNJOM, South Korea, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Delegations from
Seoul and Pyongyang began their first preparatory meeting here
Saturday morning for an inter-Korean summit slated to open on June
12-14.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which began at 10: a.m. in the Peace House, just
south of the demilitarized zone bisecting the Korean Peninsula and
runs through Panmunjom, is under way now.
</P>
<P>
It is the first inter-Korean meeting in the border village
since July 1994 when preparatory talks for a summit between then
South Korean President Kim Young-sam and late Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) President Kim Il-sung broke off due to
the latter's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
"The preparatory talks will focus on the four-point proposals
President Kim Dae-jung made in the Berlin Declaration," said Yang
Young-shik, head of Seoul's delegation.
</P>
<P>
President Kim outlined four most pressing issues between the
two sides in Germany in early March this year -- inter-Korean
economic cooperation, the establishment of peace and mutual
prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, the reunions of separated
families and inter-Korean governmental-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is vice unification minister, said his three-member
delegation will not stick to the reciprocity principle Seoul has
traditionally used.
</P>
<P>
"We will adopt a flexible approach in dealing with the North
and will not seek any immediate reward in providing economic
assistance," said the vice minister who once met DPRK officials in
Beijing, China.
</P>
<P>
"As the preliminary talks will pave the way for a summit aimed
at laying the foundation for South-North reconciliation and
cooperation, we will not make any judgment as to who is right or
wrong, but to sound out each other's positions," Yang, who has
worked in the Unification Ministry for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides must become winners from the talks," added the vice
minister.
</P>
<P>
In a crucial breakthrough after a half-century of division,
Seoul and Pyongyang reached an agreement in Beijing on April 8,
under which, President Kim will travel to Pyongyang for a summit
with DPRK leader Kim Jong-il on June 12-14.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cooperation With UNESCO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's National Committee for
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) will focus on programs that will promote
cooperation with UNESCO worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Zhang Xuezhong, secretary-general of
the committee, as saying that his committee will apply for UNESCO'
s assistance in projects of illiteracy-elimination, primary and
middle school learning and environmental education in a bid to
boost China's national drive to develop the western region.
</P>
<P>
The committee will help improve teaching at the Training Center
for Rural Education in Baoding of north China's Hebei Province.
The center, set up in 1996 with UNESCO's support, aims to
popularize farming skills in China's rural areas. The center has

<HEADLINE> Dianchi Lake Suffers Severe Algae Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Blue-green algae, which has
threatened Dianchi Lake, the biggest of the kind in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, for three decades, will soon be out of
control again, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the provincial government has spent
more than three billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars) in the
past decade trying to bring the algae under control.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Xunru, deputy governor of Yunnan, admitted that
the best solution to the problem is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
Blue-green algae, a kind of water plant, grows easily in
polluted water with a high concentration of nitrogen and
phosphorous and with a temperature around 18 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Too much blue-green algae will remove oxygen from the water
killing fish and other aquatic life, and can turn Dianchi into a "
dead" lake.
</P>
<P>
Blue-green algae has been threatening Dianchi Lake since 1970s.
Last year, blue-green algae covered 20 km of the lake, accounting
for one fifteenth of the lake's total area.
</P>
<P>
Four sewage treatment plants were built near the lake since
1993. They able to treat 365,000 tons of waster water each day.
</P>
<P>
A government-led campaign last year forced 249 of the 253
factories along the lake to stop dumping their industrial sewage
into the lake.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government also spent 250 million yuan (30
million U.S. dollars) to dredge 4.2 million cu m of mud.
</P>
<P>
But the efforts fell short. The network to collect sewage is
incomplete and more than 80 percent of domestic sewage with
fertilizers and pesticides still flow into the lake through 16
rivers, said experts.

varieties of geological disasters including landslides, mud-rock
flows, avalanches, earthquakes, desertification, water and soil
erosion, and more than 50 percent of them are the result of human
activities.
</P>
<P>
These disasters cause direct economic losses of about 30
billion yuan (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) each year.
</P>
<P>
China has issued regulations on protection of geological relics,
and prevention and control of geological disasters. A geological
environmental monitoring network has been nearly completed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the Ministry of Land and Resources
organized experts to study the geological environment, and 52
large-scale geological disasters were successfully forecast.
</P>
<P>

China Drafts Law on Defense Education
</P>
<P>
China is drafting the law on national defense education to
create greater public awareness about the nature and importance of
national defense.
</P>
<P>
A number of forums have been held in northeastern, eastern and
southwestern areas to solicit suggestions from local officials,
experts and representatives from different circles.
</P>
<P>
A draft is expected to be completed within this year and will
be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, the top legislature, for further review.

<P>
Sex Crimes Decrease in Beijing
</P>
<P>
The number of sex crimes has declined over the past 20 years in
Beijing, according to statistics from local courts.
</P>
<P>
Although crime in general is increasing, fewer than three
percent of the criminal cases are sex related, seven percent lower
than in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was partially due to harsh crackdowns by the
police. A spokesman for the Beijing Public Security Bureau said
Tuesday that the police closed down three unlicensed night clubs
on April 7, fining 5,000 yuan and arresting 53 female escorts.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, police searched three other entertainment
venues and found 44 drug traffickers, confiscating 40 pills and 11.
2 grams of ice.

</P>
<P>
A kidnapping ring which abducted 84 women and children and
forced them to provide sexual services has been destroyed, the
Ministry of Public Security confirmed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
A police investigation revealed that since 1997, Wang Heqiao, a
female farmer in Zunyi County, southwest China's Guizhou Province,
has collaborated with a dozen of her family members in abducting
84 women in her county.

<P>
Farmer Jailed for Selling Golden Monkey Skin
</P>
<P>
A farmer in northwest China's Shaanxi Province is now serving a
three-year jail term for illegally selling the skin of a state-
protected golden monkey.
</P>
<P>
Kang Xiangjun, a farmer in Taibai County, was convicted earlier
this year by a local court of skinning a golden monkey he found in
a hill near his home last year and attempting to sell.
</P>
<P>
In another development of environmental protection, more than 2,
000 illegally captured wild birds were released in north China's
Tianjin Municipality earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
As the largest port city in north China, Tianjin is an
important habitat for many Asian migrant birds. Qilihai, a nature
reserve there, is a resting place for more than 100 kinds of birds,
including a dozen of rare birds.
</P>
<P>
Crackdown on Smuggling Successful in Guangxi
</P>
<P>
The Nanning Customs in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has cracked 167 smuggling cases and confiscated 13 million
yuan worth of goods in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The number of smuggling cases customs dealt with decreased by
one percent while money from the smuggled goods decreased 35
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, police in Nanning handled 88 smuggling cases,
confiscated 75 million yuan worth of goods, seized dozens of
smugglers' boats and trucks, and arrested 48 smugglers.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
major news on health care and medical research in China over the
past week:
</P>
<P>
Biggest Health Threats in China
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by China's Ministry of Health show that
cancer and respiratory illness remain the biggest health threats
to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
About 140 out of every 100,000 Chinese urbanities died of
cancer and some 133 out of every 100,000 rural people died of
respiratory illnesses last year, making these the major causes of
death in the country.
</P>
<P>
Control over Medicine Quality Tightened
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of 8,501 kinds of medicine revealed that 754
failed to meet state standards. Compared with 2.7 percent
substandard drug products from pharmaceutical plants, about 12
percent of the drugs available in drug stores or used in hospitals
were of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
State Drug Administration, which oversees the country's
pharmaceutical industry, said on Monday that it will take
effective measures to strengthen supervision over the quality of
medicine and stem fake products from flowing into the market.
</P>
<P>
More Young Chinese Susceptible to Cancer
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the Chinese Academy of Medical Science advised
the Chinese people to undergo cancer check-ups before the age of
30 because more and more young people are becoming susceptible to
the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
The high-risk age group for malignant tumors such as the
stomach cancer and esophagus is between 35 and 40, about 10 years
younger than previously.
</P>
<P>
Official Emphasizes on Medical Ethics
</P>
<P>
A Chinese health official urged the circle to pay attention to
ethical problems triggered by rapid progress in medical technology.
</P>
<P>
Although high technology has led to more advanced treatment,
many problems also appear to be unavoidable, such as rocketing
medical expenses, regional imbalance in health-care resources, and
euthanasia, said Zhu Zonghan, director of the Beijing Municipal
Bureau of Health.

Latest statistics show that the sales revenue of China's
pharmaceutical industry grew 13.7 percent to reach 116.6 billion
yuan in 1999.

The profits of pharmaceutical plants across the country totaled
168 million yuan, 21 percent more than that a year earlier.

<P>
China Close to Finishing HGP Task
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists announced Monday they are close to finishing
their quota to sequence chromosome 3, about 30 million base-pairs
of the human chromosomes, which accounts for one percent of human
genomes to be deciphered.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists joined last September a nine-year old
international project aimed at deciphering human genomes by 2003,
which determine the health and longevity of human beings.
</P>
<P>
New Gamma Ray Medical Facility Developed
</P>
<P>
A new medical facility using Gamma rays to treat tumors, called
the dimensional and directional Gamma ray treatment system, has
been developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional medical facilities using Gamma rays
to treat brain tumors, this new facility can be used to treat
tumors anywhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
Fewer Hospitals, More Doctors in China
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by China's Ministry of Health show a drop
in the number of medical institutes and a slow growth in the ranks
of medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
China had a total of 311,000 hospitals, clinics, disease
prevention agencies, health care centers, research institutes, and
medical schools and colleges by the end of 1999, compared with 314,
100 in 1998. Some 5.57 million people worked in these institutions,
a rise of about 35,000 over 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Giant Panda Habitat to Be Built in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Foping County, known as the "
wildlife kingdom in northwest China's Shaanxi Province," will
spend 10 million yuan to build a new habitat for giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The money will go toward construction of a 2,000-hectare forest
belt where giant pandas can live, play and find their favorite
food -- arrow bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife centers will be set up in 11 townships to protect this
rare species and conduct scientific studies on pandas. Thanks to
protective measures taken in recent years, the number of giant
pandas in the county has grown to over 100.
</P>
<P>
Foping County, located on the southern slope of the Qinling
Mountain which is covered with dense forest, has 433 kinds of wild
animals, including 11 species under top state protection.
</P>
<P>
The county was opened to foreigners in late 1990s. Last year,
it signed a contract with the city of San Diego in the U.S. state
of California on jointly studies of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,
with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of
Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To protect the animal,
dubbed China's "national treasure", the country has set up 33
nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China Map Publishing House
recently advertised in the Beijing Youth Daily for 30 software
engineers, web programmers and page designers for its newly-
established electronic information center.
</P>
<P>
And like the popular Beijing-based daily, a number of other
publishing houses in the Chinese capital are looking for a few
good web supervisors and personnel for data bank development.
</P>
<P>
This is a sign that publishing houses in Beijing are gearing up
for the challenge of the booming e-commerce in China, and hiring
enough staff to be ready for the marriage between the traditional
publishing industry and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Wang Quanguo, director of the electronics information center of
the China Map Publishing House, said that the advertisement for
web workers was necessary to keep up with the rapid growth of e-
commerce and the developing geological information system.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is becoming brisk business in China, he said, adding
that real estate development, the layout of large supper markets,
improvement of urban traffic and other commercial activities will
all require the building of a multi-functional geological
information system.

<HEADLINE> Syria Not to Cede Rights or Territory: Syrian Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Syria would not cede any of its
rights or give up any inch of its territory, said the central
leadership of Syria's National Progressive National Front.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the united front of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist
Party and other five major political parties met here Saturday
night. They listened to a report by Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
on the latest developments of the peace process on the Syrian
track.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated that a just and fair peace would be
conducive to the overall regional security and stability, according
to Syria's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
On the talks with Israel, the leaders said Israeli government
was not serious in achieving peace in the Middle East based on
international legitimacy and principles and a full Israeli
withdrawal to June 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that "Syria categorically rejects any form of
ceding its rights or giving up any inch of its territory."
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks were resumed in Washington in
December after a break of nearly four years, but they hit a snag
again after two fruitless rounds in January.
</P>
<P>
The two sides mainly disagreed over where their borderline
should be drawn. Syria demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East, while Israel
refuses to make an advance commitment.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's planned pullback from south Lebanon, the central
leadership of the Syrian front considered the Israeli move as a
victory for the Lebanese resistance which upholds Syria's stand, it
was reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to pull out its troops from the self-styled
security zone in south Lebanon, carved out in 1985 after two
invasions, by June, even in the absence of a peace agreement with
Lebanon and its main power broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the front vowed to continue working hard to
promote Arab solidarity as "an insurmountable wall against all
risks and challenges."

<HEADLINE> Iran Must Find Out Causes of Insecurity: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Seyed
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said here on Saturday that Iran must find
out the root causes of insecurity which is worrying the supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry and all provincial governments should try
to identify the root causes of the insecurity in the society and
adopt effective measures to strengthen unity and national security,
Lari told a meeting of governor-generals of all the 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Seyyed Ali Khamenei recently expressed his
strong opposition to U.S.-style reforms, gave warnings to reformist
newspapers and called for "legal violence" to deal with activities
threatening the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the remarks of the leader, Lari said that
security in every society depends on the behaviors and acts of the
different groups of the society, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the incidents that occurred since moderate
President Mohammed Khatami came to power in 1997, the minister said
during the electoral campaign for the presidential elections some
individuals were spreading the rumors that if Khatami became
president, insecurity would dominate the country.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the recent social commotion has been
masterminded by those who were promoting the theory of insecurity
during the presidential elections which resulted in a landslide
victory for President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The minister mentioned the serial killings of moderate
intellectuals and writers last year, saying the crimes were
committed by those who intended to show that the government was
unable to establish security in the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sixth parliamentary election in February which
ended in the overwhelming victory for reformers, Lari said the
election has been held in a sounder atmosphere compared to the last
round of the legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
However, Lari said, "I do not know why the results of some
constituencies have been invalidated by the Guardian Council (GC)."
</P>
<P>
As a watchdog of the election, the conservative-dominated GC has
cancelled the election results in a number of constituencies,
resulting in a series of protests.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Global Oil Companies Discuss Saudi Energy Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday
resumed talks with three international oil companies who are
seeking a share in the Saudi energy development pie.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ministerial committee in charge of the talks held
separate meetings with the board chairmen of the American oil
giants Texaco, Enron and Occidental in the Saudi city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Saudi committee had already held meetings with
other three oil majors, namely Royal Dutch/Shell, Chevron and the
Phillips Petroleum Company.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince invited international oil companies to invest
in the Gulf oil kingdom's energy sector in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 international oil companies responded and
submitted investment offers to the Saudi government.
</P>
<P>
Since last Monday, chiefs of the companies have been arriving in
Saudi Arabia to hear feedbacks about their investment proposals.
</P>
<P>
While experts estimate these companies could invest around 30
billion U.S. dollars, Riyadh is hoping to attract up to 100 billion
dollars in its upstream gas sector and downstream oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer with gas reserves
of 6 trillion cubic meters and 261 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves, has stated that its upstream oil sector will remain off
limits to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal, who heads the ministerial
committee, has said that the "objective of the negotiations is not
seeking technology for the development of oil, but for investment
in gas and downstream oil."
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal said the oil industry is being run at the highest
level of professionalism by using Saudi staff.
</P>
<P>
The management of oil industry in the Kingdom has "reached a
level of efficiency that makes it match any international
standard," he added.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Banks Sell 1.547 Bln Dlrs to Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian banks have sold 1.547
billion dollars to private companies this year, the "Gestion"
newspaper, specialized in economic issues, said Saturday .
</P>
<P>
The financial report says in reference to cash exchange
operations that so far banking institutions have sold 4.345
billion dollars and bought 5.442 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
These transactions have been made in a context in which the
national currency has undergone a 0.14 percent revaluation or
appreciation when the average interbank dollar diminished from 3,
486 to 3,481 soles, the national currency.
</P>
<P>
Forward dollar purchase and sale operations have been bigger in
the last weeks, taking into account the political events and the
fear of new rises in the U.S. rates of interest, which makes more
costly foreign financing, according to financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
However, they explain that this has not been so, because the
lesser availability of soles has forced the banks to acquire more
national currency and sell it at future.
</P>
<P>
The increase of dollars sales to Peruvian firms shows that
these private entities are trying to protect themselves from an
eventual future increase in the exchange rate.

<HEADLINE> (EDS: with new lead, more details) Elian Reunited With Father, Relatives Arrives in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. federal government seized the six-year-old Cuban boy
from the home of his Miami relatives in a predawn raid, ending a
five-month standoff between the government and Elian's Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno both
indicated that the authorities used force to remove Elian from his
relatives in Miami after they refused to surrender the boy
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Despite the happy reunion of the father and son, some U.S.
politicians were critical of the administration's handling of the
case.
</P>
<P>
"The chilling picture of a little boy being removed from his
home at gunpoint defies the values of America and is not an image
a freedom-loving nation wants to show the world," Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a nation of laws, not guns. Custody disputes are
resolved in the calm of a courtroom, not in the terror of middle
of the night raids," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press photo taken when the raid took place showed
that the a federal agent pointed a gun at Elian.
</P>
<P>
Reno told reporters that "if you look carefully" at the picture,
"it shows that the gun was pointed to the side, and that the
finger was not on the trigger."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) agents
stormed the home of his Miami relatives in Little Havana at 5:15 a.
m, local time Saturday, firing pepper spray into an angry crowd
and took away the boy for the reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian was brought out of the home by a woman agent, put into a
van and whisked away. By six o'clock, the boy has been put on an
airplane heading to Washington.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the boy was accompanied by the female
immigration agent who picked him up from the home, a surgeon and
the immigration agent who led the raid. He was given a play kit
including toys, a toy plane, a map and a watch.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, who arrived in Washington on April 4, has been
waiting in Washington for about two weeks to take custody of his
son.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton defended the forceful seizure of
Elian Gonzalez, saying that the right thing has been done for the
six-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he totally supports the attorney general's
decision to send federal agents in to take the boy from his
Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the White House that Reno had gone to
great lengths to convince the Florida relatives to voluntarily
give up the boy, and was left with no alternative other than to
use force. The law has been upheld and the right thing has been
done, he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was kept informed throughout the night of the progress
of the negotiations between the Justice Department and Gonzalez's
relatives, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
After being told by his chief of staff John Podesta that all-
night negotiations to resolve the custody dispute failed, Clinton
said that he was disappointed and gave the green light to seize
the boy from the Miami home of his great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Reno told a press conference that the government tried every
way it could to get the family of the Miami relatives to surrender
the boy before taking the action, but the negotiations failed and
the family refused to turn over the boy.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the paramount concern for the morning's raid was the
safety of the child.
</P>
<P>
She said eight federal agents were in the house and one female
agent picked up Elian. She spoke with him in Spanish. The whole
process lasted for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that the Justice Department will abide by an appeals
court rule that the boy will remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father expressed his gratitude to the U.S. authorities.
"We are grateful to the attorney general and the Department of
Justice for upholding the law with utmost concern for the safety
and well-being of Elian Gonzalez," the father's attorney, Greg
Craig, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general was tireless. She was insistent that we
continue our effort to achieve a peaceful and voluntary transfer
of custody."
</P>
<P>
"We too are sad that force was required, but to the very end
Lazaro Gonzalez placed road blocks in the path of an orderly
transfer of custody. He gave the attorney general no alternative."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck in the
Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned
when their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
Elian has been living in the home of his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez since then. U.S. authorities spent weeks trying to
arrange a peaceful transfer of Elian from the relatives to his
father.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Americans demonstrated for weeks outside the home to
block the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, the INS ruled that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba. However, the Miami
relatives insist the boy should stay with them in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Confirms Soccer Player Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Atlantico Nacional
soccer team player Andres Estrada was kidnapped near the Carmen de
Bivoral municipality, northwest of Colombia, police confirmed
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sportsman was traveling in a car with a woman and a minor
when he was intercepted Friday night by a group of four men and
two women, said Colombian police operative commander general
Alfonso Arellano.
</P>
<P>
The officer attributed the kidnapping of Estrada to the
National Liberation Army (ELN), the second biggest rebel group in
the country after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
.
</P>
<P>
The soccer player's wife Alejandra Arias said that she has not
received any message from the kidnappers and that Estrada had
never been threatened.
</P>
<P>
The person who accompanied the football player said that one of
the kidnappers told Estrada that he had to meet with the "
commander of the group."
</P>
<P>
The wife of the soccer player asked the kidnappers to respect
the life of her husband and demanded them to release him
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The board of the Nacional club, the only Colombian team which
ever won the Libertadores of America Cup (1989), showed concern
for the fate of the player and said they hoped for the prompt
return of the player.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Approves Elian's Return to His Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government Saturday
approved "the much expected and emotional" encounter of boy Elian
Gonzalez with his father in Washington, according to an official
report repeatedly broadcast by the local radio and television.
</P>
<P>
The media have maintained the people of the island abreast
through communiques of the events that started past five on
Saturday's morning, when U.S. federal agents entered the house in
Miami where Elian was retained.
</P>
<P>
The agents took Elian and immediately sent him to the Andrews
air base to join his father, who, according to the photographs
transmitted at midday, were very happy with their reencounter.
</P>
<P>
Communique No. 3 says that "the delivery of the boy to his
father means a favorable turn toward a just, honorable and right
solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
The meeting occurred at the air base at 09:43 local time, five
months and two days after November 20, 1999, when they were
separated without the knowledge of his father.
</P>
<P>
The communique says that Elian, his father Juan Miguel and his
wife, and the couple's youngest son will remain Saturday for some
hours at the base, while Juan Miguel and his lawyer analyze the
subsequent steps related to their presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Court of Appeals decided that they cannot return
immediately to Cuba before the end of a judicial process started
after a demand of political asylum for Elian filed by his Miami
far-removed relatives.
</P>
<P>
It is foreseen that a court will be in session on May 11 to
decide on the case, while Attorney General Janet Reno insists that
only the father has the legal capacity to speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities have stated since their first communique,
broadcast here after six in the morning, "the need and high
convenience" of not staging public demonstrations in the island "
which could influence negatively the future evolution of the
situation."
</P>
<P>
The people have responded with discipline to this call, but
happiness is seen everywhere, in every house where the radio and
television is heard and seen and in the positive comments among
the families.
</P>
<P>
The news of Elian and Juan Miguel's reencounter was awaited
with anxiety by the Cubans in the island, who have not ceased to
reclaim since December 5, with marches, open forums, and round
tables the repatriation of the boy.
</P>
<P>
An open forum has been convoked Saturday afternoon in Jaguey
Grande municipality in the western province of Matanzas, where
Cardenas, Elian's hometown, is located.
</P>
<P>
The official report says that "the need to fight for Elian has
not ended, but the delivery of the child to his father means a
favorable turn toward the just, honorable, and correct solution to
the problem."
</P>
<P>
The federal operation to take Elian and deliver him to his
father occurred 48 hours after Juan Miguel called on the U.S.
people to support him in his claim for his six-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
Elian survived the wreckage of a raft with 14 illegal emigrants,
a tragedy in which his mother and other 10 persons drowned, so the
U.S. migratory authorities gave temporary custody to a grand-uncle
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Miami relatives had refused since then to surrender the
minor, despite the reiterated demands of Juan Miguel, who had the
support of his government from the first moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 141 persons were
detained Saturday during a confrontation between 1,000
demonstrators and 200 military policemen near the Porto Seguro
municipality in the Brazilian state of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
A group of demonstrators of "Brazil, Another 500," formed by
Indians, the Landless Workers Movement (MST), the Workers Unique
Central, and other social groups, tried to jump a police control
point in Santa Cruz de Cabralia near Porto Seguro.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations for the 500 anniversary of the discovery of
Brazil will be held in this place Saturday afternoon and presided
over by Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his
Portuguese counterpart, Jorge Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
Policemen used tear gas and rubber bullets to scatter the crowd
that was demonstrating its disagreement with the celebration of
this date, and 141 demonstrators were detained.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian police have implemented a series of controls in
the main roads leading to Puerto Escondido to guarantee the
security in the commemorations.
</P>
<P>
President Cardoso canceled his visit to the indigenous village
of Corona Vermelha in view of the security problems and to prevent
bigger incidents.
</P>
<P>
According to historians, when Portuguese navigator Pedro
Alvares Cabral arrived in Brazil at the head of a Portuguese
expedition on April 22 of 1500, the territory had 5 million
indigenous people, most of whom were assassinated by the
Portuguese colonizers.
</P>
<P>
The last official statistics put the indigenous population at
350,000 people.

BRASILIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said Saturday in his speech commemorating the 500
anniversary of the discovery of the country that Indians, blacks
and landless peasants have a reason to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said during a breakfast with his Portuguese counterpart,

Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived in Brazil on

President Cardoso admitted that the society of the country is

out of the benefits of development. He said that democracy is the
main instrument to fight that social exclusion.
