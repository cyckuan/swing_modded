<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Sunday
that a 300-million Birr (42 million U.S. Dollars) worth animal
resources development project will be launched in the coming
1999.
</P>
<P>
Haddera Gebru, head of animal and fishery resources
development department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the
five-year project includes animal husbandry, fodder manufacturing
and improving veterinary services, the Ethiopia News Agency

<P>
Ethiopia stands first in Africa and tenth in the world in its
livestock resources. Hides and skins export is the second
largest export item in the country second only to coffee.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Extremists Detained, Security Tightened for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police Sunday detained
a number of Jewish right-wing activists and beefed up security
measures to foil attempts by Jewish extremists to attack the top
leaders, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The activists were taken into custody for questioning in
connection with vandalism, attacks against Palestinians in the
West Bank town of Hebron or incitement during demonstrations
outside the residence of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army lifted in the day a curfew imposed 10 days ago
on the Israeli-controlled part of the town when a Jewish settler
was stabbed to death by someone who the Israelis alleged was a
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, where more than 400 Jewish settlers live alongside
120,000 Palestinians, has witnessed sporadic clashes between the
two sides since Israel handed over most parts of the town to the
Palestinians last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security has been tightened for Israeli President
Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mordechai
amid reports that Jewish extremists are planning to attack or even
assassinate them to head off a possible agreement with the
Palestinians on Israel's overdue withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's General Security Service has reportedly advised
Netanyahu to limit his public appearance or wear bullet-proof vest
if he has to go out.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to take serious precautions to prevent any attack on
its leaders, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the extremists are also planning "massive murder
attacks against Arabs in the West Bank" and to attack Arab holy
sites to provoke Palestinian retaliation and create "a spiral of
violence that will sabotage the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohamed Hussein, director of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Arab
East Jerusalem, was quoted by Israel Radio as saying Sunday that
the mosque has always been the target of Jewish extremists.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the Israeli government to prevent any attacks on
the mosque, which was destroyed by an Israeli arsonist 29 years
ago and rebuilt later, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Calls for Talks to Solve Election Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk on Sunday urged Cambodian political leaders to resolve
disputes through dialogues, in an effort to calm the political
unrest haunting the country in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered from Siemreap, Sihanouk called on those
ready to use violence to avoid such acts, saying that they are
against the Constitution and laws of the country and are
detrimental to the interest of the people.
</P>
<P>
Though the "serious events" happening in recent weeks could not
be termed as violence, the king said, they have drawn serious
criticism from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk also voice worries that if friendly countries stopped
providing aid, Cambodians would plunge deeper into poverty and
desperation.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian politicians have to solve their differences through
talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, oppositions led by the FUNCINPEC party and the Sam
Rainsy Party have been staging massive protests against the
Cambodian People's Party (CPC), alleging that the CPC won the July
26 parliamentary elections through fraud.
</P>
<P>
The oppositions have refused to accept the preliminary election
results.
</P>
<P>
Protests started to escalate on Sunday. Chanting slogans
against Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and Vietnam, more than
10,000 demonstrators took to the street despite a ban by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened in Phnom Penh as protesters damaged the
Monument to Cambodian-Vietnamese Friendship, which stands close to
the parliamentary building.

<HEADLINE> Aqsa Mosque Reopens to Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem
was reopened on Sunday to visitors in response to a call by
Palestinian economic and tourist sectors in the city.
</P>
<P>
The famous mosque was closed to the public four days ago by
its authority in protest of the arrest of two Palestinian youths
by Israeli police and the presence of the Israeli border guards
inside the holy sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
The two Palestinian youths were arrested by Israeli police
Tuesday morning near the western entrance to the mosque and no
reasons for the arrests have been given.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news, a large number of Palestinians
gathered inside the mosque to protest, forcing the authority of
the mosque to close it to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said that because certain radical Jewish
groups are threatening to attack the mosque, the Israeli police
and border guards can not be removed right now from it.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, told the Voice of
Palestine on Sunday that the Israeli claims are only excuses for
keeping its soliders in the compound of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian side continues to contact the Israeli
side on this issue, urging Israel to withdraw the border guards
from the holy site.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Jerusalem sent a
letter on Sunday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani, requesting them to pull out the border guards
from inside the mosque.
</P>
<P>
"The continuous presence of border guards could ... cause more
problems and conflicts," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Aqsa Mosque is one of the historical holy sites in East
Jerusalem managed by Palestinian religious figures. Tens of
thousands of visitors visit it everyday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem is to visit northern Cyprus Monday to discuss the upcoming
delivery of Russian-made S-300 missiles, the Anatolia News Agency
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit to the north of the divided island,
Cem is expected to meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
on the sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
The visit follows a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement that
Ankara would not change its position on the missile deal between
Russia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insisted the surface-to-air missiles will constitute a
serious threat to security of Turkey and Turkish Cypriots as well,
and vowed to prevent their deployment with all necessary means.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Russia will deliver the S-300 missiles to
Cyprus in November, in light of the 425 million U.S. dollar deal
signed by the two countries early last year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since kept a 35,000-strong, heavily-armed force in
the northern part, where Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in
1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic," recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Not to Attend NAM Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, president of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Sunday he would not attend
the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"No, I am not attending the summit. I am too busy organizing
resistance against foreign aggression in my country. We shall be
represented by our minister of state," Kabila told media in
Zimbabwe after talks with President Robert Mugabe, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report said Kabila's Justice Minister Mwende Kangolo
arrived in Durban Sunday to attend the NAM summit due to open on
the coming Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president of the vast central African country paid a brief
visit to Zimbabwe Sunday for talks with his dogged supporter,
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have offered Kabila military
backing and sent troops to fight the rebels who took up arms
against Kabila on August 2 in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda, his former allies which had
helped him oust late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, of
backing ethnic Tutsi-led rebels who started a revolt in the east.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have denied the charge but insisted that
they reserve the right to intervene if their national security is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said Sunday the war in his country was over on the
western front and was moving to the rebels' eastern stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the government army had re-captured the
strategic hydro-electric Inga dam in the southwest of Congolese
capital Kinshasa. There were also reports that some of the rebel
soldiers had fled to the neighboring Congo Republic across the
Congo River.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Confident in Overcoming Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin is confident in overcoming the current crisis
in the country, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview Chernomyrdin said Sunday evening that
"We know what first steps to take to improve the situation." I am
sure it is possible to overcome the crisis in the country," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed that "We cannot waste time. The country
cannot live without a government."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the political accord worked on by heads of the
presidential administration, government and parliament in the
morning, Chernomyrdin said that "I am very glad that this document
was prepared by us, not working groups, or assistants or
consultants. We coordinated it in advance."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there remain differences in the agreement
but they "are not fundamental". It is a matter of "the main
political agreement to be approved by the president; his approval
is very important. In that case we will get down to business," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with calls of giving more powers to the government
and Duma, but said "today the Duma should be giving powers to
itself first of all - so that everyone would be doing one's job."
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, the main working principles of
government in Russia should be clarity, concreteness and fastness.
If financial problems have to be resolved today, if decisions must
be made - no matter by whom - the government, the Duma or the
president, it should be done in one move, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On personnel of the government Chernomyrdin said the government
should be made of people "who know and understand how things should
be done, and not just what should be done."
</P>
<P>
An agreement on political compromises among the Russian
president, government and both chambers of parliament was reached
by the representatives of the tripartite commission at Sunday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The document provides for a mutual non-aggression pact, that is
the president will not dissolve the State Duma before elections in
1999, the Duma will not raise the question on the government's
resignation, the cabinet will not put forward in the Duma the vote
of confidence in the government issue.
</P>
<P>
Now the political accord has been submitted to the Russian
president for confirmation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Pledges Financial Aid to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will provide a total of
29.5 million U.S. dollars in loans and grants to help rebuild the
war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The financial aid is aimed at improving facilities of Bosnia's
national carrier Air Bosnia and repair buildings and bridges
damaged during the 1992-95 civil war, Ecevit told reporters upon
returning from a trip to the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit went to Bosnia to attend a ceremony marking Turkey's
Army Day held by Turkish troops stationed in the town of Zenica as
part of the multinational peacekeeping force, according to the
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ecevit held separate meetings with Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic and Muslim-Croat Federation President
Ejup Ganic on bilateral ties and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with one of the co-prime
ministers, Haris Silajdzic, the Turkish deputy prime minister said
that Turkey is ready to offer an aid package to help heal the
wounds of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular country,
maintains close ties with Muslim-dominated Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM Denies Links with Bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail denied Sunday any links with Saudi-born
millionaire Osama bin Laden who is accused of planning the August
7 bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan has nothing to do with bin Laden," Ismail said at a
press conference here in the Kenyan capital, where he stopped
over on his way from Khartoum to Durban, South Africa for the
Non-Aligned Movement conference.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses bin Laden of running a global
"terrorist" network from bases in Afghanistan and of using the el
Shifa pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital as a terrorist
facility, a charge denied immediately by Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Washington attacked with cruise missiles the el Shifa plant
and another target in Afghanistan on August 20 in retaliation for
the embassy bombings, which killed 253 people, including 12
Americans, in Nairobi and another 10 in Dar es Salaam earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said there are no links between the raided plant and
bin Laden, who left Sudan in 1995 at the request of the Sudanese
government because of widespread allegations that he was involved
in other bomb attacks around the world.
</P>
<P>
"We told Osama bin Laden that our position is to have good
relations with the Arab nations and with our other neighbors, and
that is not compatible with you staying here," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
"Osama bin Laden left Sudan in 1995 and he never came back...
We cut all links," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ismail also reiterated Sudan's call for a U.N. fact-finding
mission to investigate the activities of the el Shifa plant, a
call that has been backed by the Organization of African Unity
and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has deferred a decision on Sudan's
request.

<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The largest security operation
since the World War II swung into top gear in Durban Sunday as
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit draws near.
</P>
<P>
Vernon Hunter, the provincial coordinator for NAM security,
said police in Durban were trying their best to make the city
safer with a "steel broom" being used to sweep drug peddlers,
prostitutes and vagrants off the streets.
</P>
<P>
A two-day senior officials meeting of the 12th NAM started
Saturday, to be followed by the NAM foreign ministers meeting
Monday and Tuesday and the summit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that 430 policemen and women had been put on
special crime-prevention detail to keep the city safe for the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
"With the influx of NAM delegates, they will be obvious
targets for criminals: carrying cameras around their necks and
speaking foreign languages," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police in Durban "are doing a sweep-up operation and are
trying to keep the city as crime-free as possible", he added.
</P>
<P>
Alex Wright, chief inspector of the Durban City Police, said:
"We don't want to get a negative impression of Durban as a
tourist destination, so we will try and look after our visitors
as best as we can."
</P>
<P>
The total security component for the NAM, including police,
bodyguards, intelligence agents and defense force is about 4,000
people, including 1,200 security personnel, according to Hunter.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- All immigration officials of
Nigeria are now to study the French language to enhance their
ability to communicate with foreign nationals coming into this
West African country, a top immigration official said.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Sahabi Dange, Comptroller-General of the Nigeria
Immigration Service (NIS) said this at the weekend at a forum
organized by the News Agency of Nigeria in federal capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Federal Ministry of Education had
concluded arrangements for the take-off of the program as part of
the efforts to enhance the performance of the immigration
officials.
</P>
<P>
Further more, he said, ability to speak French will now be
considered in all recruitments into the NIS.
</P>
<P>
Dange appealed to Nigerians to show understanding to
immigrants from neighboring West African countries, most of the
which have French as their official language.
</P>
<P>
As citizens from co-member countries of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), the immigrants have the rights
to reside and engage in business in Nigeria, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has drawn up plans to teach French as a foreign
language in all its schools, as a way to promote cooperations
with its French-speaking neighbors.

faction will not sign the draft political agreement and will vote
against the candidature of Viktor Chernomyrdin to the post of
prime minister, leader of the communist party Gennady Zyuganov
stated on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov's remarks came Sunday evening after a conference of

<HEADLINE> NAM Meeting Working Out Document on Disarmament, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 30 (Xinhua)-- Senior officials attending the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) meeting are working hard to complete a
draft communique on issues including disarmament and debt relief,
for formal adoption by their leaders at NAM summit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Observers said this document has already gone through several
drafts. The draft document provides broad themes of consensus on
issues like the need for the reform of the U.N., especially the
Security Council, to give developing countries a greater say.
</P>
<P>
It also includes international disarmament, particularly
programs to decommission nuclear arsenals, and Third World
development, including debt relief, trade access, technical
assistance and investment.
</P>
<P>
The need to ensure that globalization has a positive impact on
the poorest countries will also be a major issue at the summit.
</P>
<P>
A parade of heads of state or their representatives from
developing countries will sweep into Durban Tuesday to attend the
summit the following day.
</P>
<P>
A backdrop of terrorism and U.S. reactions, spiraling African
conflict and the prospect of a global economic meltdown will add
spice, even urgency, to their speeches.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, whose chairmanship of the Movement will start
when Colombia's tenure expires as the summit opens, might use its
mandate for the next three years to modernize the capacity,
culture and content of the Movement.
</P>
<P>
It is clear, especially from South Africa's proposed
amendments, that reformers within the NAM are pushing to move it
out of the realm of demands and rhetoric. Instead, there is a
new emphasis on engagement with, rather than condemnation of, the
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in NAM's history, the U.S., Britain, and
France will attend the global organization's summit, as will
representatives of the European Union, and the G-8 grouping of
the world's most highly developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The invitation extended to these countries to attend as guests
appears largely to have been the initiative of the host country,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Minty, South Africa's Deputy Director-General of Foreign
Affairs, who is in charge of the summit's policy deliberations,
said Friday that the presence of representatives of the most
powerful western nations will make it possible for real
interaction to take place between the developed and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
What is also emphasized is an acknowledgement of the
responsibility of NAM nations to contribute to this process by
getting their own financial and political houses in order.
</P>
<P>
Through NAM, South Africa hopes to put development at the
center of a new framework of global diplomacy to replace the
vacuum left by the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's attempts to reform the 113-nation NAM is a goal
as ambitious as the African Renaissance, the observers noted.

<HEADLINE> Republicans, Democrats Voice Separate Views on Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The third-ranking Republican
of the House of Representatives wants Congress to stay in session
until it completes action on Independent Counsel's report expected
soon about President Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said the House should take up the
Lewinsky matter as soon as Starr submits a report and should not
go home for the year until it has reached a conclusion on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"If the president is going to put us through this trauma, then
we need to get it over with as soon as possible," DeLay said on
"Fox News Sunday." "We need to stay in session for as long as it
takes to get this behind us."
</P>
<P>
DeLay, a leading conservative, repeated his position that
Clinton should resign.
</P>
<P>
But Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said on NBC's "Meet the Press," that Clinton, who leaves Monday
for a trip to Russia, remains an effective world leader, "an
enormously strong president internationally and in his own
country."
</P>
<P>
The House returns from summer vacation after Labor Day and
plans to be in session for only a month before going home for the
midterm elections. Other Republican leaders, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, have shown little enthusiasm for initiating
contentious impeachment hearings before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Starr has not indicated when he will submit his report or
whether it will go beyond the president's admitted improper
relationship with the former White House intern and associated
allegations of obstruction of justice, perjury or suborning
perjury.
</P>
<P>
Once the report goes to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee
must decide whether it contains sufficient evidence to bring
impeachment proceedings before the full House. Once there, the
House would have to vote on whether to impeach, turning the matter
over to the Senate for final judgment on the president's expulsion
from office.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday's news shows, Democrats promised not to allow
Judiciary hearings to become a simple indictment of the president.
On Fox, Representative John Dingell said Starr and his staff
should be questioned about their conduct of the investigation.
Representative Marty Meehan said on ABC's "This Week with Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts" that a minority viewpoint should go
forward with the report" so that the president has an opportunity
to present the other side."
</P>
<P>
Representative Lois Slaughter, a Democrat, said on the same
program that if Starr comes up with nothing beyond the Lewinsky
affair, "It will be forgotten and it will be dropped like a bad
memory."
</P>
<P>
Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat, said he and Senator
John Kerry, a Democrat, urged the president to come forth with
more about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"The president admitted to us that the timing of his speech was
probably not the best and that he wished he had more time to
reflect and get his emotions together before he addressed the
American people," McGovern said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
DeLay and Dingell agreed that Starr's report and parts of the
grand jury testimony on the case should be made public. "I would
like to see the executive summary of the report minus any
pornography revealed to the American people immediately," DeLay
said.
</P>
<P>
Dingell said that while the grand jury testimony should be
reviewed, for the Starr report "synopsis is not sufficient. The
whole of his report must be made public."

During the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu told

cooperation between PNA and terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, Israel is continuing to demand the PNA to
fulfill its commitments and curb terrorist activities.

connection with vandalism, attacks against Palestinians in the

outside the residence of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security has been tightened for Israeli President
Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mordechai
amid reports that Jewish extremists are planning to attack or even
assassinate them to head off a possible agreement with the
Palestinians on Israel's overdue withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls for Dialog in Solving Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Sunday called for dialog and negotiations to solve
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The warring sides should support the recent resolution adopted
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) at a
mini-summit in Pretoria, South Africa, he said at a dinner in
honor of visiting Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to Rwanda and Burundi, the two countries in the
Great Lakes region which are having civil strifes, to resort to
dialog and tolerance as the only means to conflict settlement,"
Chissano added.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president also expressed worries over the
worsening political and military situation in Angola, where the
opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has been delaying implementation of the 1994 Lusaka
peace accord and therefore plunging the Angolan peace process
into a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Only candid and rational talks can put an end to the war and
the sufferings of the Angolan people, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, it takes concerted and unremitting
efforts by countries, regions and international organizations
concerned to solve conflicts in Africa and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the next Organization of African Unity (OAU)
summit in Algiers could be held with less or even without
conflicts and terrorism and discuss issues concerning Africa's
economic, social and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also extends the wish to enhance bilateral
cooperations with Algeria especially in fisheries, energy,
industry, transport, education and trade.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president arrived here Sunday afternoon on his
way to go to Durban, South Africa to attend the Non-Aligned
Movement summit Wednesday. The two heads of state will hold
formal talks here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Women's Movement Must Follow Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The women's movement in China
must adhere to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory to
achieve final success, according to the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF) which defines its task as seeking true equality
between men and women.
</P>
<P>
"We owe all the achievements for women's movement in China over
the past two decades to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and
the future of the movement depends on our adherence to that
theory," according to ACWF Vice-President Gu Xiulian. Gu made the
remarks today to the 1,300 delegates attending this afternoon's
opening ceremony of the Eighth National Congress on Chinese Women.
</P>
<P>
"This is an iron-clad conclusion we have drawn from the history
and reality of the women's movement in China," said Gu.
</P>
<P>
She said Deng Xiaoping Theory reflects the Marxist view of the
important role women play in human society, and defines the
correct path to ensure the advancement of the women's movement in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping Theory stresses that ensuring equality between
men and women is a fundamental state policy directly related to
social progress in China, and also provides a theoretical basis
for solving major problems concerning self-improvement for women
under the conditions of the socialist market economy," according
to Gu.
</P>
<P>
She said that studying Deng Xiaoping Theory will enable Chinese
women to get a better understanding of the fact that the
emancipation of women involves a long historical course. She also
stressed that arduous task remains to achieve the true gender
equality as required by law.
</P>
<P>
Gu went on to say that the ACWF has decided to launch a
nationwide campaign to inspire Chinese women to enthusiastically
study Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
She told delegates that the ACWF has set a general goal for the
development of women's movement in China between now and the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
The goal centers on ensuring that the fundamental state policy
of equality between men and women is further implemented
nationwide, and ensuring strengthened protection and improved
conditions for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women should enjoy greater equality in terms of
economic, political and cultural rights by the year 2010, and
should at the same time see remarkable improvements in their
family life and general quality.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese women must make every effort to abandon the psychology
of inferiority and reliance on men, and constantly create new
female images in line with contemporary trends, while at the same
time carrying forward traditional virtues," said Gu.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Buhe, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), today
called on NPC deputies and Standing Committee members to fully
understand the Constitution and laws, and to enhance their

</P>
<P>
He stressed that an expanded understanding and acute awareness
of related areas is a prerequisite for ensuring their ability to

Buhe made the remarks during today's lecture on Agricultural
Law Enforcement and Inspection sponsored by the NPC Standing
Committee. Wu Fuzhao, former deputy director of the NPC Standing
Committee's Commission of Legislative Affairs, and Chen Zongyuan,
vice president of the Chinese Association for the Promotion of
Agricultural Technology, also explained the Agriculture Law and
the Law on Promoting Agricultural Technology, as well as the
status of implementation for same.
</P>
<P>
Buhe pointed out that law enforcement inspection is an
important measure the NPC Standing Committee has introduced to
fulfill its supervision duty. He also pointed to the practical
significance in organizing a lecture on the law prior to the law
enforcement inspection.
</P>
<P>
He said the lecture will provide inspectors with a better
understanding of concerned law, inspection procedures and the
current status of China's agriculture and countryside.
</P>
<P>
Today's lecture was the first the NPC Standing Committee has
sponsored prior to the law enforcement inspection campaign. The
NPC Standing Committee plans to form inspection teams to conduct
inspect implementation of the Agriculture Law in Jiangsu,

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Rejects Chernomyrdin as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on Monday
overwhelmingly voted against President Boris Yeltsin's candidate
for prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin after heated debates in the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only 94 deputies voted for Chernomyrdin, way below the
required 226 votes from 450 lawmakers. Of the 345 deputies who
cast votes 251 voted against, with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The rejection would certainly push Russia into further
political stand-off between the Duma and Yeltsin, who is likely
to Chernomyrdin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The vote, originally scheduled for 18:00 local time (14:00
GMT), was taken one hour later to allow deputies to vent, for the
most part, their anger at the government and President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, the largest
opposition faction with 133 of the 450 seats, said Chernomyrdin
"does not possess a single quality necessary for leading the
government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov blasted the government's performance in the past seven
years, both under Chernomyrdin from 1992 until March this year,
and under Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed abruptly August 23.
</P>
<P>
"What has been going on in the country for seven years under
the disguise of economic reforms is now lying in ruin," Zyuganov
said. "The main cause is the (cabinet's) policy, the absence of
basic governance and a total lack of responsibility among the
country's rulers."
</P>
<P>
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky accused Chernomyrdin of
creating "an extremely inefficient economic system, a
semi-criminal one" during his previous term as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Windows 98 Chinese Version </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The fact that Windows 98 has
attracted great attention in the world's most populous country is
far from surprising.
</P>
<P>
The long anticipated Chinese version of Microsoft's latest
personal computer operating system was ushered today during a
dazzling ceremony which included a red Ferrari, music reminding
one of James Bond movies, fireworks, disco music and a light
show.
</P>
<P>
The English version was launched in the United States a little
over two months ago on June 25. Today's introduction means "we
have significantly narrowed the gap between the time Microsoft's
products are available in the United States and other parts of the
world," said Michael Rawding, regional director of Microsoft
Greater China.
</P>
<P>
Windows 95 was introduced in China in 1996, almost eight months
after it appeared in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98 "will have a stronger influence" than it's
predecessor in terms of preinstallation by personal computer
manufacturers, according to Juliet Wu, general manager of
Microsoft (China) Co. Limited.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed appreciation for the contributions of major local
PC producers such as Legend, Founder, Tongtru, and multinational
hardware manufacturers such as AMD and Compaq in the development
and preinstallation of the new product.
</P>
<P>
Legend and Microsoft dedicated over six months to ensure the
"smooth integration" of the hardware and latest software,
according to Yang Yuanqing, senior vice president of the Legend
Group.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts point out that preinstalling the most
advanced operating system is a common practice amongst the world's
major PC manufacturers, and the concurrent availability of
preinstalled computers in China with the release of the Windows 98
Chinese version is ample evidence of the maturing market
activities of the local industry.
</P>
<P>
They also point out that concurrent availability is in best
interests of genuine software and is conducive to the growth of
China's software industry.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98 offers more and better network functions than
Windows 95, as well as better integration of work and recreational
functions.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98 may not, however, represent the benchmark that
Windows 95 represented for some people, said Martin Wu, China
marketing manager for Intel. Nonetheless, its graphic and Internet
applications provide amply proof it is a "good product," said Wu.

<HEADLINE> First Anniversary of Princess Diana's Death Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Family Monday attended
a private service at Crathie Church near Balmoral in Scotland on
the first anniversary of the death of Diana, the princess of
Wales, BBC reported from Balmoral.
</P>
<P>
Princes William and Harry, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and
his two daughters, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, were
joined by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife at the service.
</P>
<P>
The young princes looked somber as they traveled from Balmoral
to the nearby church accompanied by the Queen and 10 other senior
members of the Royal Family.
</P>
<P>
They thanked the nation for sharing their grief over their
mother's death but asked for privacy to be alone.
</P>
<P>
At the Princess's home at Kensington Palace in London and her
burial site at Althorp House in central England, crowds gathered
and laid flowers at the gates for remembrance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Union flag is flying at half-mast over
Buckingham Palace and all public buildings as a mark of respect
and remembrance of Diana who died in a car crash in Paris just a
year ago at the age of 36.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's spokeswoman said in a statement: "The Queen and the
Royal Family, particularly the Prince of Wales, Prince William and
Prince Harry, would like to thank people for their messages and
kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and for sharing their
remembrance of the Princess of Wales."

<HEADLINE> Floods Strike Yarlung Zangbo River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An extended period of heavy rain
has caused severe flooding along the Yarlung Zangbo River in the
Tibet Autonomous Region and inundated vast stretches of land in
the river valley, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tributaries of the Yarlung Zangbo, including the Lhasa and
Nyang rivers, have recorded several flood crests over the past two
months, with a dramatic rise in water levels along the former,
according to the local meteorological department.
</P>
<P>
The water flow rate in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo
River stands at 8,500 cu.m./second, with the rate in the lower
reaches of the river reaching 12,800 cu.m./second.
</P>
<P>
Cities and prefectures along the river, including Lhasa,
Xigaze, Loka and Nyingchi, have suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics say that flood waters have inundated
14,000 hectares of cropland, killed over 4,000 heads of livestock,
destroyed over 2,000 houses and seriously damaged a large number
of highways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from the regional Party Committee, government
and civil affairs departments are directing rescue efforts in
flood-stricken areas. They have also allocated funds totalling six
million yuan (720,000 U.S. dollars) and have supplied over one
million sandbags and 100 tons of wires for the flood control.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Withdraw All Combat Troops from East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces will
withdraw all its combat troops from East Timor in due time, a
military commander said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have long been planning to withdraw our troops (from East
Timor) and this is not due to foreign pressure," the Antara News
Agency quoted Major General Adam Damiri as saying.
</P>
<P>
Damiri is the chief of the Udayana regional military command
which oversees Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia recently pulled out 1,500 troops from East Timor, but
four battalions consisting of about 4,000 troops remain there.
</P>
<P>
Once it withdraws all the combat troops, Damiri said, the
military will only retain health and spiritual detachments and a
territorial task force.
</P>
<P>
"Their task however is only to assist East Timoreses in
non-combatant fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian troops entered East Timor in 1975 after the
departure of the Portuguese colonists and annexed the territory
the following year.
</P>
<P>
Though Indonesia declared East Timor its 27th province in 1976,
the United Nations has been demanding Jakarta withdraw troops from
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
During the August 4-5 tripartite dialogue in New York, Portugal
agreed to study Indonesia's proposal to grant East Timor special
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, East Timor would enjoy autonomy, which
allows it full governance except in the fields of foreign affairs,
external defense and some monetary policies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Uganda Deeply Concerned Over Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- As the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experiences twists and turns,
the Ugandan authorities have shown deep concern over the armed
conflict between the government troops and the Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
The raging war in DRC is feared to spill over into a regional
conflict. Uganda has urged for a political solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the eruption of the armed conflict on August 2,
Uganda's attention has been drawn to it because DRC has accused
Uganda of instigating the rebellion and being militarily involved
in the war, a charge Kampala quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
Last week, both Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya and Major General
Salim Saleh revealed on separate occasions that Uganda has a
sizable military presence in eastern DRC. But it is there to
"safeguard Uganda's national security", they said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has reportedly two battalions there working with
President Laurent Kabila's soldiers to flush out rebels of Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) under an April security pact between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels, operative since January 1996, have conducted
abductions and looted properties of the impoverished people in
Uganda's western districts of Kases, Kabarole and Bundibugyo,
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda hoped both warring parties can accept the call for
peace made by the recent summit meeting of the Southern African
Development Community and solve the issue at negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is experiencing its biggest ever economic boom and it
does not want to drag its economy into shambles again by being
sucked into the war.
</P>
<P>
The peace and stability in the Great Lakes Region is crucial
to Uganda's economy, one of the few success stories on the
continent. Its privatization and liberalization added power to
its growing economy.
</P>
<P>
DRC is Uganda's key trading partner in the region. There is no
reason for Uganda to attack such a neighbor and trade partner
just in order to lose it, President's Press Secretary Hope
Kivengere told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia are reported to have
sent military support to DRC and some of the rebels' strongholds
began to fall into Kabila's hands. Foreign involvement is feared
to regionalize the war and make things more complicated,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
They fear that the ethnic war, no end in sight, will surely
affect regional economic cooperation and cast a dark shadow over
the region.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Kabila's army has begun to advance to the eastern
city of Goma after claiming victory in Kinshasa. This will
definitely invite more and closer attention from the
international community including Uganda.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Calls for Emergency Meeting on Russian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official has called for an emergency meeting of the European Union
to study the exacerbating Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Patrick Child told the press on Monday
that Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner responsible
for economic, financial and monetary policy of the European Union,
consulted with Austria, which is serving the rotating presidency
of the union, on a meeting of European finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner suggested to hold the meeting prior to
Thursday's meeting of the European Commission, the executive body
of the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the commissioner had asked for an informal
meeting among finance ministers to study the case.
</P>
<P>
The commission has kept saying that the Russian financial
crisis is not affecting the economy of the European Union very
much and the crisis still remains a problem of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Officials said on several occasions that the commission was not
considering to offer more funds to bail Russia out of the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been giving Russia technical assistance
through its TACIS program that also covers central and eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The total yearly available funds for the TACIS program is 500
million ECU (550 million U.S. dollars) with a third of the sum
usually going to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia has received 400 million ECU (440 million dollars) in
1998 alone, commission officials said.

<HEADLINE> Higher Vigil Called For As Floods Begin Retreating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters (SFCDRH) today called for greater
vigilance in monitoring the flood situation along the Yangtze River
and the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
In this year's fourth plenary meeting of the SFCDRH presided
over by Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, director of the SFCDRH,
participants warned against a slack in vigilance as flood waters
recede along the major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The participants pointed out that the risk of breaches and
possibility of collapses along levees is even higher in sections
of levees waterlogged for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
They urged continued 24-hour monitoring of levees along the
Yangtze, Songhua rivers and around Dongting and Poyang lakes, as
well as continued efforts to reinforce dangerous sections in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Preparations should be made to ensure the availability of
adequate stockpiles of reinforcement materials, as well as plans
for plugging breaches and rescue efforts if needed.
</P>
<P>
The SFCDRH called on hydrologists and experts to increase
technical guidance and urged leading officials to strengthen
supervision in order to ensure the ultimate success of the flood
control effort.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the eighth flood crest that passed
through Shashi in Hubei Province this morning has pushed the
waters in Jinjiang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to
surge again, threatening the already worn-out dykes in the
section.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 2.32 million soldiers and civilians are
reinforcing dangerous levees and closely monitoring flood status
along the river.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Anti-Smuggling (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The monthly magazine Qiushi,
China's leading official publication, in its 17th issue for the
year to be published on September 1 carries the full text of
Premier Zhu Rongji's July speech at the National Anti-smuggling
Work Conference calling for prompt and relentless crackdown on
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged departments and governments at all levels to fully
realize the urgency and significance of the anti-smuggling
campaign. He said both the Party and central government are
determined to wipe out rampant smuggling and noted the success
will have a direct bearing on the realization of this year's
growth target, as well as the smooth development of China's
reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign is also essential for building a clean
Party and government.
</P>
<P>
Zhu outlined the grave situation and pointed out that rampant
smuggling has reached a zenith in terms of the scope and quantity
of goods, as well as the unscrupulous means employed by smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The list of over a hundred targeted goods includes oil
products, edible oil, motor vehicles, motorcycles, textile and
chemical raw materials, pirated CDs and cigarettes. The estimated
value of goods smuggled into China each year exceeds 100 billion
yuan (12 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rampant smuggling has also led to massive losses in terms of
tax revenues. Related activities have also hindered the growth of
national industries and aggravated difficulties facing state-owned
enterprises. Smuggling has also corrupted Party and government
officials, poisoned social morals and lead to a surge in criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the anti-smuggling campaign is not only a major
economic struggle, but also a harsh political struggle," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The premier listed the root causes of rampant smuggling and
pointed out certain individuals in the Party and government
organizations, judicial departments and even military units have
been heavily involved in smuggling. Certain officials interested
only in group or personal gains have turned a blind eye to
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
At least part of the blame can also be placed on weak law
enforcement. Certain law enforcement and judicial departments have
simply fined smugglers, rather than prosecuting the perpetrators
to the fullest extent by the law in court. Their actions have
simply encouraged the spread of smuggling, said Zhu.

<TEXT>
<P>
The premier outlined the focal points of the massive
anti-smuggling campaign set for the second half of the year. He
pointed out that law enforcement efforts will focus on areas rife
with smuggling, including Guangdong Province and coastal areas in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, especially in waters off
Zhuhai in the former and China-Vietnam border areas in the latter.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged public security bureaus and judicial departments to
pay special attention to two particular types of smugglers:
enterprises, mostly Sino-foreign joint ventures, which engage in
smuggling under the cover of legal entities in the processing
trade, and companies operated by certain Party and government
organizations, the armed forces and even public security
departments.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign should focus on companies with a history of
related activities. Leading officials with work units that own
related companies should be assigned full responsibility for their
involvement in smuggling," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He called for relentless punishment for major cases and leaders
of major smuggling rings, as well as for the "execution of
notorious smugglers in accordance with the law." He added that no
one should shield criminals or interfere with law enforcement
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu disclosed the following three important measures the
central government will take to reform the current anti-smuggling
effort and standardize related practices -- form a national
anti-smuggling police force; authorize Customs departments to
handle all smuggling cases with the support of public security
departments and industrial and commercial administrative
departments; and ensure all fines, goods and property confiscated
concerning smuggling cases are turned over to the state treasury,
and the central financial department will give back part of the
proceeds to the localities to boost the anti-smuggling campaign.

</P>
<P>
The nominee needs 226 votes in the 450-seat State Duma to win

</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Russia, which dominates the Duma, and
some other opposition parties had expressed their determination to
vote against Chernomyrdin's candidacy during the parliamentary
session.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kotenkov, presidential representative to the Duma,
also predicted, "the State Duma will most probably turn down
Viktor Chernomyrdin's candidacy today," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, leaders of the opposition parties and the government
drafted an agreement that would give parliament more power over
the line-up of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But President Boris Yeltsin refused to sign the agreement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Closer Economic Ties with Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri called Monday for closer cooperation with Romania in trade
and economy.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile, Hariri told a news conference that they discussed
bilateral ties, especially economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Romania will increase imports from
Lebanon and remove all obstacles preventing Lebanese goods from
entering Romanian market.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Lebanon imports an annually 100
million U.S. dollars worth of Romanian goods while its exports
stand at 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that during the meeting, he explained to his
Romanian counterpart Lebanon's stance on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said that Romania understands and supports Lebanon's
stance and called for the revival of the peace talks among the
concerned parties in a bid to realize a comprehensive and lasting
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected an Israeli offer made last April to
withdraw troops from south Lebanon on condition that Lebanon
guarantee the security of its northern areas. Lebanon insists the
Israeli withdrawal be unconditional under the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985, allegedly to protect its northern
areas from attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Vasile arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day visit,
during which he also will hold talks with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The eighth Yangtze River flood
crest of the year passed Yichang, Hubei Province, today raising

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health issued an
urgent circular today, urging medical departments at all levels to make
efforts to prevent possible outbreaks of epidemics at school in flood
ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
The circular said as new school term starts, students are
returning to campus. Schools in flood-stricken areas are striving
to start new school terms in time.
</P>
<P>
However, many school buildings in disastrous areas are
seriously polluted, their sanitation facilities are severely
damaged. Therefore there is potential danger of outbreaks of
epidemic diseases, the circular cautioned.
</P>
<P>
It called on epidemic prevention organizations to step up
guidance and supervision over campus sanitation to ensure teachers
and students have clean food, drinking water and environment.
</P>
<P>
School rooms should be thoroughly disinfected and newly-built
school rooms should meet state sanitation requirements. Lectures
should be given in schools to increase students' health awareness,
said the circular.
</P>
<P>
Students should have health check, especially those from
flood-hit regions, to prevent contagious diseases from spreading
on campus.
</P>
<P>
Medical departments should have adequate stocks of medicines
for fighting against possible epidemics, the circular
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate for
the 11-country euro zone remained stable at 1.4 percent in July,
Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau for the European
communities said that the inflation for the 15-nation European
Union dropped to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, however, registered the highest inflation in either
the euro zone or the union at 2.8 percent while France and Austria
both had the lowest rate at 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
EU-wide, the inflation decreased from 1.6 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The largest relative increase of inflation was recorded in
Portugal, from 1.4 percent to 2.8 percent in the past 12 months,
while the largest decrease was found in Germany from 1.5 percent
to 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the European Economic Area (the 15 EU
member states plus Norway and Iceland) also witnessed a decrease,
from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat designed a special method to measure the inflation for
the euro zone. The measurement, known as MUICP, is calculated as a
weighted average of the Eurostat harmonized indices of consumer
prices of the 11 participating countries in the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland are participating
in the single currency mechanism that starts on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
EU member states Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece did not
join in.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank and other European community
institutions will use the MUICP measurement as a main indicator
for monitoring inflation in the context of their monetary policy
management.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President Visits Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan left here for Khartoum on a two-day visit to Sudan for
consultations with Sudan on combating anti-Iraq and anti-Sudan
actions of the U.S. and Israel, Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Ramadan as saying that his visit to
Sudan came within the context of consultation and dialog between
the two countries on confronting the schemes and atrocities
carried out by the Americans and the Zionists.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed
al-Bashir, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Sudan of sponsoring international terrorism,
fired cruise missiles on August 20 at a pharmaceutical factory in
Khartoum in what it claimed retaliation for bombings on August 7
of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people were killed and more than 5,000 others
wounded in the twin bombings of the U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Sudan, Ramadan will fly to South Africa to take
part in the 12th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that in South Africa, his delegation would hold
extensive talks with a number of brotherly and friendly
delegations with the aim of developing relations between Iraq and
these states in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the Iraqi delegation would seriously
contribute to the NAM summit agenda, mainly the paragraphs
relating to freedom and independence of peoples.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan pointed out that the Iraqi delegation would brief the
NAM states on the latest developments in relations between Iraq
and the Security Council and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
for disarming Iraq and on Iraq's legitimate demands of the lifting
of the international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq had implemented all commitments under
U.N. resolutions and the Security Council should lift the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people have been suffering from the eight-year
embargo due to America's hegemony over the Security Council and
its insistence to prolong it," said Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
and the International Atomic Energy Agency, complaining that
UNSCOM is dominated by the United States and used by it as a tool
to prolong sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that
it is free of chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Countries Meet on Customs Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The SAARC Group on Customs
Cooperation held deliberations recently on the formulation of an
action plan to ensure uniformity, harmony and simplification of
customs rules and procedures among the member states for regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Several activities to this end were identified at the group's
third meeting held in Jaipur, India on August 24-26, the
Kathmandu-based SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation) Secretariat said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The activities include preparation of a commodity description
code, expanding the 6-digit H.S. Code to accommodate description
of goods in vogue within the SAARC region, and adoption of baggage
laws, procedure and allowances, and law, procedure and exemption
limits on gifts and postal goods, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the group also identified matters related to
temporary import of vehicles and other goods and subsequent
re-export of them in the same state.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Sukumar Shankar, member of the
Central Board of Excise and Customs of India, stressed the growing
importance of regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of the over 75 free trade zones or customs unions
listed by the World Trade Organization, more than half were
established in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if the free trade arrangement is to be
operationalized in the SAARC region by the targeted date, the
customs laws and procedures must be harmonized.
</P>
<P>
At their ninth summit in May, 1997, leaders of the SAARC member
states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka -- decided to establish a South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) preferably by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
At their 10th summit held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in late July
this year, the leaders skirted the time-frame for SAFTA, but
decided on drafting a comprehensive treaty regime by 2001 for
creating a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Group on Customs Cooperation also decided at its
meeting that its chairmanship would be for a period of two years
and rotated alphabetically among the member states, and that Sri
Lanka would take over the chairmanship from Pakistan at the end of
this year, the SAARC Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the group will be organized by the SAARC
Secretariat in April/May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Accepts Amarjargal's Nomination as PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Monday accepted the nomination of Renchinnyamin
Amarjargal as the country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman said that Mongolia's National
Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party nominated the
36-year-old Amarjargal, a Great Hural member and acting minister
of external relations, in a letter to the president on August 28.
</P>
<P>
The president has agreed to the nomination and submitted it to
the Great Hural for approval, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal, born in 1961, graduated from a Moscow university
and was the president of the Mongolian Economy Institute. He was
elected to the Great Hural in July 1996 and appointed as the
minister of external relations in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal is one of the founders of the National Progress
Party and the National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed the government led by Tsakhya Elbegdorj
on July 24, blaming it for worsening the country's banking crisis
by deciding to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with the
private Golomt Bank.
</P>
<P>
The president had rejected seven times the nomination of
Davaadorj Ganbold, the chairman of the Standing Committee of
Economic Policy of the Great Hural, as premier.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Hassan Discuss U.S. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held talks here Monday
to discuss Israel's possible acceptance of a U.S. peace proposal
on its next troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered other aspects of the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, the official
Jordan Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Nasir Judeh said earlier
Monday that Arafat`s visit came in the context of continued
consultations between the Jordanian and Palestinian leaderships
in light of the recent developments which required coordination
among all the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Other details of the meeting were not disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his delegation arrived here Monday afternoon for a
brief working visit, en route to South Africa to attend the summit
of The Non-aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was also scheduled to meet new Jordanian Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been deadlocked since
early 1997 due to Israeli settlement expansion and delay in
carrying out the long overdue troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, the U.S. put forward a peace proposal in
January calling for a 13.1 percent withdrawal from the West
Bank. While Arafat has already accepted the proposal, Israel has
refrained publicly endorsing it citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
But latest developments signaled that Israel is close to
accepting the U.S. proposal conditionally. On Monday, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet that he was
willing to accept the U.S. proposal on condition that the
Palestinians meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to demand the Palestinian side revise the
clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israeli
destruction and crack down tougher on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country to seal peace with Israel after
Egypt, has been playing a role in mediating the peace process,
taking advantage of its close ties with both parties.
</P>
<P>
While Jordan is a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, it
is also Israel's best friend in the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Announces Satisfactory Interim Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-listed China Telecom
announced satisfactory interim results on Monday, based on the
rapid growth in the mobile telecommunications businesses on the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months ended June 30, 1998, the blue-chip
company recorded a net profit of 3.47 billion yuan (419 million
U.S. dollars), while revenue amounting to 11.37 billion yuan (1.4
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shi Cuiming, chairman of the blue-chip company, told a press
conference that he was pleased with the results and fully
confident in the company's future prospects.
</P>
<P>
Following a multi-billion-HK-dollar acquisition of Jiangsu
Mobile earlier this year, China Telecom now owns cellular
telecommunications businesses in Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu,
all of which are among China's richest and fastest growing
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The company's cellular subscriber number reached 5,452 million
by the end of June, up 27 percent over half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With the continued economic growth in China, the company faces
strong market demand and enjoys a huge market with enormous growth
potential, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The company will continue to explore opportunities to acquire
high quality assets on the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom was listed concurrently in Hong Kong and New York
in October last year and was added to the 33-stock Hang Seng Index
on January 27, 1998.

percent of the respective totals.
</P>
<P>
The enrollment rate of school-age girls stands at 98.6 percent

have emerged as the major trend in China.
</P>
<P>
Committees of women's federations at all levels have developed
rapidly, with the number of committees standing at 66,000. In
addition, there are currently 100,000 women's organizations in
various types of ventures, including township and private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that a number of problems and difficulties must be
solved in order to further improve the social status of women.
</P>
<P>
The problems include the rising number of laid-off women,
difficulties in finding new jobs, the considerable number of
poverty-stricken women in rural areas and the comparatively low
participation rate of women in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Gu stressed that a wide gap remains in education levels for
urban and rural women, and violation of that rights of women has
not as yet been eliminated.

SINGAPORE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Haunting fears of a global
equities meltdown pulled down Singapore Stock Market sharply lower
Monday as the newly-introduced benchmark Straits Times Index (STI)
replaced the 30-year old Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) as
the dominant barometer of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The 55-stock STI, that picked up from where the phased-out
30-counter STII left off to ensure continuity, plunged by 28.83
points to close at 856.43 points. The STI was expected to better
reflect the market trend.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 195.72 million units worth 311.71
million Singapore dollars (about 175.18 million U.S. dollars).
Decliners outnumbered advancers by 213 to 55 with 321 counters

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Newly listed large state
businesses have become the earnings stars on the Chinese stock
market for the first six months of this year, reporting
substantially better yields than the average market level.
</P>
<P>
For the 14 such state-owned companies that each have listed a
minimum of 100 million shares this year, they reported an average
per share yield of 0.17 yuan, about 1.62 times the average for the
810 companies that have reported earnings so far.
</P>
<P>
Their average rate of return was 6.7 percent for the first six
months, 1.6 times the average level for the whole market.
</P>
<P>
The market reported sliding company efficiency during the
January-June period this year, with an average per share yield of
0.105 yuan and a rate of return of 4.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Handan Steel, with a net profit growth of 120 percent over the
same period last year, led the group of large state firms,
reporting a per share yield of 0.318 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said that at least two factors laid solid
foundations for the improvement of these companies: they are all
involved in backbone industries, and they have undergone
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"The government policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand
and the two rounds of rate cuts also helped a lot," according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
In a large scenario, the market also saw fewer blue chip stocks
this year and many more loss-making companies, which have risen to
71 from the 38 in January-June 1997.

Turkish communities in Cyprus to end the 24-year-old division of
the island.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Turkish Cypriot regime reaching here
termed the proposal as "a final effort" to achieve a mutually
acceptable lasting solution in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the proposal for the confederation of "two
peoples and two states" at a press conference in Nicosia with the
presense of visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
The condition Denktash set to the negotiations for the
confederation is the acknowledgement of the Turkish Cypriot side
as a "sovereign and equal" state as the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also proposed a special "symmetrical ties" between
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots and between Greece and the Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third after a failed coup by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara, against
the internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by
the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cem said his presence at the press conference is an expression
of "the Turkish Government's support and trust for President
Denktash."
</P>
<P>
Denktash said the 1960 guarantee system adopted at the founding
of the Republic of Cyprus should continue should the Cyprus
Confederation be established.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey are the three guarantors of Cyprus'
independence from an 82-year-old British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Confederation may, if both parties jointly agree,
pursue a policy of accession to the European Union (EU), said
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Until Turkey's full membership to the EU, a special arrangement
will provide Turkey with the full rights and obligations of an EU
member with regard to the Cyprus Confederation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is maintaining more than 35,000 troops with a claimed
aim to protect Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
communities broke down last summer after Denktash walked out to
protest EU's decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government, rather than the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader pointed out that "if the Greek
Cypriots agree to this final basis, we are ready to begin
negotiations to establish the Cyprus Confederation."

<HEADLINE> Non-Aligned Members Urged to Close Gap Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN (South Africa), August 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa,
chairman state of the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Monday
called on member countries to spare no efforts to narrow the gap
between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the NAM foreign ministers meeting, South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said NAM countries should strive to
attain sustainable rates of economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"All of us have to work to eliminate poverty in our countries,
to improve the quality of life of the millions of our people, to
close the gap between the rich and the poor both internationally
and universally."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki pointed out that the developed countries could not
maintain and expand their prosperity while billions of others are
victims to dire misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
He said sustained prosperity in the West might help bring
stability and renewed growth to Asia and elsewhere, but the
spreading crisis was also likely to export instability to the
West.
</P>
<P>
The deputy president appealed that the world economy should be
managed in a way that ensures the transfer of resources from those
who have them to those that have not.
</P>
<P>
"We must make the fairly obvious point that the untapped markets
in the world economy are those of the developing world, represented
by us who are members of the Non-Aligned Movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the eradication of poverty and backwardness, Mbeki
stressed that NAM countries should rely on themselves rather than the
developed.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 44 NAM member states and seven observer countries
participated in the meeting, which is to focus on various issues of
international concern, including sustainable development of regional
and world economy and peace settlement of regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, topics of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons and the United Nations' reform, will also be on top of
agenda.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Agriculture Law Enforcement Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) will inspect the implementation
of the Agriculture Law in September in Jiangsu, Guangdong and
Yunnan provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the
NPC Standing Committee announced today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the NPC Standing Committee's fifth inspection
since the Agriculture Law was promulgated in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee held a plenary meeting of the four
inspection teams today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said China's
agriculture and rural economy are sound overall. However, some
obstacles that have long hindered agricultural development,
especially this year's enormous floods, have put agricultural
production into severe difficulty, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that agricultural production is directly related
to fulfilling the 8 percent national economic growth rate goal,
because agriculture is the basis of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, this year's Agriculture Law enforcement inspection
is specially important, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the fundamental status of agriculture in the national
economy has been further enhanced since the promulgation of the
Agriculture Law, while China has made increasing investment in
agriculture and intensified its invigoration through science and
education.
</P>
<P>
He requires that the inspectors increase their awareness of
this inspection and attach more importance to such issues as
prolonging the land contract period, easing the burdens on
farmers, agricultural input, and the popularization of
agricultural technology and circulation of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors should go deep into the grass-root units and
solicit opinions of grass-root officials and farmers to discover
both their achievements and their problems, he said.

The sources said the two rebels have told the police that they
were taken by force by the LTTE in July last year at Kokkadicholai

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Constitutional Council Rejects Poll Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Constitutional
Council rejected opposition parties' poll complaints Monday,
saying the complaints were "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The rejection by the nation's highest legislative body paved
the way for the National Election Committee (NEC) to announce the
official election results.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition parties -- the royalist FUNCINPEC party
led by Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) of former
finance minister Sam Rainsy -- lodged 110 complaints to the
Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
Among the 17 complaints accepted by the council, two were put
to hearing Monday while the 15 others were ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Bin Chhin, spokesman of the Constitutional Council said that
all the complaints were considered "baseless."
</P>
<P>
He said the council was also looking into the opposition's
complaints that the NEC halted recounting for disputed communes
after only eight were completed. None of the recounts turned out
to be any hard evidence of rigging.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have called on the council to consider
recounting in roughly 800 communes, or about half of all counting
centers, where provisional results are disputed.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC and SRP have been boycotting the results of the
election since the announcement of preliminary results early in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Since August 24, the main opposition parties have organized
massive sit-in protests in front of the National Assembly,
demanding proper response to their complaints.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday denied rumors that he has tendered
his letter of resignation.
</P>
<P>
There was no truth in the rumors that he was resigning on
Friday, Anwar told reporters at Bukit Mertajam in the northern
state of Pulau Pinang, when asked to comment on the rumors and
speculation over his resignation, according to a report by
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was assigned to be the successor of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, said that he would not step down but would
continue to discharge his duties as deputy prime minister and
deputy president of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)
of which Mahathir is the president.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said he would not entertain such talk as they were spread
by irresponsible people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bernama said, Pulau Pinang UMNO Youth head Abdul
Rahim Ghouse called on the government and the party to take stern
action against those responsible for spreading such rumors.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the youth leader believed that there might be "a
high-level conspiracy network" out to ruin Anwar's political
career.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim said that the people should not be distracted from
their focus in overcoming the current economic situation and at
this time undivided support should be given to the prime minister
and his deputy.

Mahathir Mohamad, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Cabinet
Ministers were among the large number of dignitaries present at

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Banks Tighten Foreign Exchange Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's central bank has imposed
a ban on forward transactions conducted at spot rates, a move
bankers said aimed at tightening rules governing foreign exchange
trading at banks, a newspaper report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks must quote foreign exchange rates within the
limit permitted by the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, the
Saigon Times quoted the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
Banking institutions must not take advantage of the difference
between forward and spot rates to make profits under any form,
including non-deliverable forward contracts, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Banks are now banned from selling foreign currency at spot
rates to customers who have no immediate need.
</P>
<P>
Banks are only allowed to sell foreign currency to cover
customers' payments which have become due, such as for imports and
services provided by foreign companies, and for local and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
If banks sell foreign currency to corporate clients to pay
foreign debts, they must check documents and ensure the money
matches the tempo and schedule of payments, which have already
been registered at the state bank.
</P>
<P>
The ban is considered by bankers as a positive measure to stem
speculative deals.
</P>
<P>
The central bank made on Thursday a decision reducing forward
transactions with periods ranging from one to two weeks, and
setting fresh margin rates for such deals.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar started
the local trading week on a fresh and more optimistic note Monday,
maintaining the gains seen offshore during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended Monday in Sydney at 56.73 U.S. cents, up from
55.99 U.S. cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency recorded a post-float low of 55.30 U.S.
cents last week.
</P>
<P>
Arab Bank's Scott Young said the Australian dollar had been
sidelined somewhat Monday by movements in the U.S. dollar against
the German mark and Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they haven't got their eye on it (the Australian
dollar) too much," he said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said speculation of a hike in official interest rates
continued to circulate in the market but most players rated any
move unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The recent fall in the Australian dollar had prompted fears of
imported inflation and spurred talk of a rate rise by the Reserve
Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed trading in Sydney at 80.35
Japanese yen from 80.27 yen and 0.9998 German marks from 1.0058
marks.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Continued uncertainty in global
markets and heavy falls in several blue-chip stocks sent the
Australian share market tumbling 1.44 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index was down 36.2 points to
close at 2480.7, off an intra-day low of 2467.5.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of uncertainty in world markets and that is
putting pressure on our market," said Dicksons client adviser
Robert Holle.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse traded in negative territory from the start,
with the tone set by a 114.31-point drop on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average in New York which closed at 8051.68 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ord Minnett dealer Chris Shaw said sharp falls by News Corp,
diversified miner BHP and National Australia Bank stock were
together responsible for a large slice of the Australian market's
fall.
</P>
<P>
News Corp plunged 78.1 Australian cents, or 6.81 percent, to
10.69 Australian dollars while its preferred scrip dived 52.3

</P>
<P>
On the resources board, BHP shares tumbled 34 cents to the
five-year-low level of 12.06 Australian dollars, with resources
stocks generally succumbing to global market concerns and low
commodity prices.

4409.0.

National Australia Bank ditched 32.7 cents to 21.62 Australian
dollars, contributing to a 99.4 point slide on the bank index to
5485.2.
</P>
<P>
Shaw said bank stocks were generally weaker on speculation of a
possible interest rate rise to prop up the weak Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia shed 24.8 cents to 18.66
Australian dollars, ANZ bank slid 21.8 cents to 8.83 Australian

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Turkmen Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- During talks with Turkmen
President S. A. Niyazov here this morning, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said the Chinese government values very much its friendship and
cooperation with Turkmenistan, which accords with the fundamental
interests of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral ties in various fields have witnessed
smooth development with increased mutual trust since the two
forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for the position of the Turkmen
government in supporting China on issues of Taiwan and of opposing
national splittism.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the Turkmen government's
efforts to maintain domestic stability and develop its economy, as
well as its pursuit of an independent foreign policy of neutrality
and the expansion of international exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China respects the road of development chosen by the Turkmen
people and will, as always, support the country's efforts to
safeguard its independence and sovereignty while maintaining
domestic stability and advancing its economy, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sino-Turkmen economic and trade cooperation, Jiang
noted that the scale of cooperation remains relatively small and
there is potential to be tapped in this area.
</P>
<P>
However, China and Turkmenistan enjoy a good political
relationship, and bilateral economic and trade ties will reach a
new level if the two sides make concerted efforts to encourage
business people in the two countries to collaborate on the basis
of equality and mutual benefit, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Likely to Lose in Duma Voting: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin will probably not survive the voting to be held
Monday in the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) for the
confirmation of his premiership, a senior Russian official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The State Duma will most probably turn down Viktor
Chernomyrdin's candidacy today," Alexander Kotenkov, presidential
representative to the Duma, was quoted by the Itar-Tass news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Russia, which dominates the Duma, and
two other opposition parties expressed their determination to vote
against Chernomyrdin's candidacy during a parliamentary session
scheduled for 3:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Monday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the report from the Interfax news
agency, Kotenkov also said that President Boris Yeltsin maintained
that Chernomyrdin was the candidate he proposed for the post of
prime minister ahead of the Duma's session.
</P>
<P>
Last week, opposition parties and the government drafted an
agreement that would give parliament more power over the make-up
of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin needs 226 votes to get the confirmation from the
450-member Duma, according to Russia's constitution.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Revises Tariffs to Ward off Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
is revising tariff rates and operational procedures to meet the
demands of a liberalized market and compete with the Tanzanian
Harbors Authority.
</P>
<P>
KPA Commercial Manager Francis Kinyeki was quoted by Monday's
East African newspaper as saying that the tariff schedules which
have been in effect since 1995 will terminate as soon as the
revision is complete.
</P>
<P>
Shipping sources said the changes are timely, in view of
rising competition from Tanzania's Dar es Salaam port, which has
been attracting more cargo from Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The KPA should not be insensitive to change as it no longer
has a monopoly in the region," said an official of a leading
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
"The team charged with the revision of tariffs and operations
should make bold changes which will enable the port to compete
with others," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The KPA has in the past come in for criticism, particularly
from Uganda importers, over poor security at the port, vandalism
of goods and claims that the port had been taken over by
unscrupulous "briefcase" agents who charge exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan importers have also complained that demurrage costs at
the Kenyan port are inflated, citing a case in which an importer
was asked to pay up to 22,000 U.S. Dollars when the actual cost
was 4,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan ministers in charge of transport, communications
and trade have discussed the complaints in a series of meetings
with their Kenyan counterparts and KPA bosses since last year.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan exporters and importers are the biggest users of
Mombasa port but have in recent years begun to explore the
northern route to the sea offered by Dar es Salaam, accessible
via the Inland Container Depot in western Kenya's Kisumu and Lake
Victoria ferry services.
</P>
<P>
Already, the KPA has liberalized some provisions in the tariff
structure to allow users to switch from road to rail at no cost,
also as an incentive to encourage use of rail transport.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Embankments To Be Fortified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China plans to allocate 1.56
billion yuan (about 188 million U.S. dollars) over the next two
years to strengthen the embankments along the lower Yellow River
in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to improve Shandong's flood control
ability, will focus on reinforcing and heightening the dikes,
dredging waterways, and enhancing the water-storage and
flood-diversion capacity of major lakes and reservoirs,
according to the Yellow River Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
As required by flood-control standards set for 2000, of the
629-kilometer Yellow River embankments in Shandong, 98.2
kilometers need to be raised, and 57 kilometers must be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is the second longest in China next to the
Yangtze, and because of serious silting the river bed continues to
rise, making it vulnerable to flooding.
</P>
<P>
This summer's devastating floods on the Yangtze has once again
put authorities related on the alert to fortify the Yellow
River embankments.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-president Christon
Tembo has urged his countrymen to cherish cultural values.
</P>
<P>
When officiating Sunday at the Kulamba ceremony of the Chewa
people in Katete, Eastern Province, Tembo told thousands of
people who attended the occasion that abandoning cultural values
would increase social problems.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the nation was headed for a serious social
catastrophe unless people take pride in their culture and its
values.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted the vice-president as saying
that such ills as street kids and prostitution would escalate if
culture was under-played.
</P>
<P>
Tembo observed that due to the collapse of extended family
system in Zambia, orphans and deserted children were pouring the
streets without any hope of growing up into useful adults.
</P>
<P>
He said such children were exposed to dangers such as
prostitution and crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
The five-member family tilled 1.6 hectares of low-yield, hilly
land which bore no crops during droughts.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement-oriented poverty-relief program was introduced
in 1995, with the central and autonomous regional government
pledging 3 billion yuan (about 361 million U.S. dollars) of
financial support. Building large power pumping stations to create
irrigated areas is considered a key to the program.
</P>
<P>
Ma Guangping, head of Baying Village, said each of his
villagers has received 0.133 hectare of irrigated land plus seeds,
fertilizer, technical assistance and 300 yuan of housing subsidy.
</P>
<P>
"We'll expect a good harvest in autumn," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xibao said he plans to buy tractors and grow fruit trees
next year, while neighbor Yang Shengcai wants to open a grain
processing mill.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Shengxian, vice chairman of the regional
people's congress, the resettlement program also can help
alleviate soil erosion of the loess plateau, as the displacement
will enable tilled hilly land to be replanted with trees.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, the autonomous region plans to build 16
more resettlers' townships designed for 478,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The program could be completed early next century, local
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Ginseng-based Drug for Curing Blood Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claim they
have developed a ginseng-made pharmaceutical that proved to be
effective in the treatment of difficult blood diseases.
</P>
<P>
With more than 2 million yuan (about 240,000 U.S. dollars) in
funds from the Chinese and Australian governments, scientists from
Zhejiang Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital have
successfully extracted and purified the necessary elements for the
medicine from ginseng, a traditional herbal tonic in China.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fengshun, a professor at the blood disease research center
at the hospital, said the clinic's use of the new pharmaceutical
in 23 cases of aplastic anemia and 33 cases of idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) demonstrated an effective rate of
82.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the pharmaceutical, after seven years of development,
has passed the appraisal of experts and won provincial awards for
scientific and technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
Gao Ruilan, another scientist at the center, said the natural
drug proved to be effective in helping generate white and red
blood cells and blood platelets.
</P>
<P>
It also helps curb leukemia cells when the patients are taking
anti-cancer drugs and reduce white blood cells caused by the
radiotherapy and chemical therapy, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ginseng-made pharmaceutical is safe and
patients did not have any toxic reactions after taking the
pharmaceutical for two years.

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Petrol Pumps to Market Unleaded Petrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- With an unenviable distinction
of being the fourth most polluted city in the world, New Delhi is
set to make a transition to unleaded petrol from Tuesday as part
of measures to contain air pollution.
</P>
<P>
All petrol pumps have been ordered by the Supreme Court to
market only unleaded petrol from September 1 and most of the
petrol stations have reportedly been phased out the leaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
Though unleaded petrol was introduced in the India's capital in
April 1995, the total phasing out of leaded petrol would be a
milestone in efforts to reduce air pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
Dilip Biswas, Chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board,
told reporters on Sunday that the environment friendly petrol
would have a maximum lead content of only 0.013 grams per liter.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that more than 85 percent of air-borne lead is
attributed to emissions from petrol-driven vehicles, Biswas said
pollution could not be immediately banished but one major lethal
substance would be out of air with a ban on leaded fuel.

Province, said Shanhaiguan was many times destroyed by wars and
earthquakes through history and and many times restored.

years ago, but much of it has rotted and some parts are in
danger. Experts say it is now imperative to renovate the

<HEADLINE> India's Overall Export Growth Remains Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- India's overall export growth
figures for the first four months (April to July) of the 1998-99
fiscal year would remain in the negative though July is expected
to show a seven percent growth compared to the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Times daily reported Monday that the export
figures for the first quarter of the 1998-99 fiscal year stood at
a negative eight percent growth.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that negative growth was registered
since the 1991-92 fiscal year when exports suffered a negative 1.5
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The dismal negative export performance was reversed in July
with export figures expected to show a seven percent growth
compared with the same month of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The change in export performance in the month comes a breather
to the Commerce Ministry which has refused to officially scale
down the export target of 20 percent growth set for the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Trade analysts are of the opinion that exports for the fiscal
year 1998-99 may at best reach a five percent growth, saying that
"a 20 percent growth target is being too optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that while the exact areas where
exports have gone up have not been fully analyzed all sectors
seemed to be slowly picking up.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the preliminary data for the first quarter of by
the Commerce Ministry showed that nearly two-thirds of India's
export items had reported positive growth but about 30 major items
constituting around 25 to 30 percent of the export basket showed a
substantial decline.
</P>
<P>
Among the major items which dipped were cotton yarn and fabrics
which declined by 20 percent, RMG man-made fabrics by 35 percent,
transport equipment by 20 percent, hardware electronics by a
whooping 60 percent, and oil meals by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors which had grown were software, gems and jewelry,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
One of the brightest sectors is the plastic industry which has
recorded a laudable 17.5 percent growth in dollar terms in the
first quarter of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Against the exports of 83.02 million U.S. dollars during the
same period last year, the industry has recorded a figure of 97.55
million U.S. dollars for the first quarter of the 1998-99 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that India's exports have been affected in
certain degrees by the financial turmoil in Southeast Asian
countries and economic sanctions by some countries and
international organizations following the country's nuclear tests
last May.

<HEADLINE> Fear Rises After Bombing in E. Africa: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Personal security emerges as
the biggest single issue to worry people in Kenya and Tanzania in
the wake of the August 7 bombings at the two U.S. embassies, a
new opinion poll reveals.
</P>
<P>
The blasts killed 253 people including 12 Americans in Nairobi
and another 11 in Dar es Salaam, leaving more than 5,000 others
injured. The costs run into billions of Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the two east African states believe that the
targeting of their nations by anti-American extremists -- and the
U.S. reprisal missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan -- make
further attacks more, rather than less likely, showed the poll by
the Nation Media Group Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, 73 percent of those interviewed said they feel less
safe than before, compared with 16 percent who believed the
bombings have not changed their security.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the difference was slightly less marked, with 69
percent feeling less safe and 21 percent saying they felt
security was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
They want to see security increased particularly at the ports,
airports and border crossings in the two countries, the poll
showed.
</P>
<P>
The retaliatory U.S. raids will lead to even more terrorism in
the world, according to 48 percent of Kenyans interviewed and 34
percent of Tanzanians, while 11 percent of Kenyans and 24 percent
of Tanzanians felt the raids would lead to more terrorism in
their own countries.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen percent of Kenyans but a tiny four percent of
Tanzanians believed the raids would result in less terrorism.
</P>
<P>
People in both countries believe they were targeted because of
lax security. Forty-five percent of Kenyans blamed lax security,
while 26 percent said it was because of the U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three percent of Kenyans and 97 percent of Tanzanians
thought the United States should compensate them for the August
blasts, saying the money should be paid by the U.S. as assistance
to the victims, as aid for reconstruction, economic rebuilding
and military support.
</P>
<P>
Two thousand people in Kenya and 1,000 in Tanzania have been
polled.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Undertakes Agricultural Credit Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
undertaken a 32.7 billion taka (695.7 million U.S. dollars)
agricultural credit program to strengthen the post-flood
agricultural rehabilitation activities, The New Nation daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Sunday at a meeting chaired by Finance
Minister A.M.S. Kabria.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, 15 billion taka (319.15 million dollars)
will be disbursed by banks and other financial institutions as
crop loan, while the rest will be disbursed for fisheries,
livestock, poultry and procurement of other agricultural inputs
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also decided to provide fresh
loans to the flood-affected farmers in the current fiscal year
holding off the repayment of their outstanding loan of the fiscal
1997-98 for one year, the paper quoted sources close to the
meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
The farmers, who had taken agricultural loan up to 15,000 taka
(319 dollars) in 1997-98 but now are unable to repay due to flood,
will be eligible for the fresh loan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the farmers who had taken agricultural loan during
July-August of the 1998-99 fiscal year and fell victim to flood
will also be eligible for fresh loan. The loan facilities will
also be applicable to the cooperative farmers.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister stressed the role of rural economic
activities in the national economy and directed the authorities
concerned to gear up the monitoring activities to ensure smooth
disbursement of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which started in early July, have hit 45 out of the
country's 64 districts, with over 400 people dead and more than
40.2 million people affected in the country.
</P>
<P>
Crops on over 214,000 hectares have been washed away or damaged
by floods, with an estimated crop loss amounting to 14.22 billion
taka (302.6 million dollars), the Ministry of Agriculture said.

been convicted of murder were executed Sunday in Gaza on the
orders of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser

expressing skepticism that Israel will fully implement a 13
percent second further redeployment in the West Bank and
questioning the U.S. commitment to a third redeployment, which
was supposed to take place on August 31 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<HEADLINE> 5 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Five Israeli soldiers were
wounded early Monday in an attack by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon, Lebanon's Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The five were wounded in the explosion of a remote-controlled
bomb planted at the Dabshi village in the central sector of the
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon when an Israeli patrol was
passing by.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli radio said four Israeli soldiers were wounded by a
helicopter accident.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an Israeli army spokesman as saying that the
U.S.-made Bell 206 overturned on landing near the Dabshi village.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio said following the blast,
Israeli helicopters landed at the site and evacuated the victims,
some of whom were reported to be seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has claimed responsibility in a statement for the
attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties came a week after two Israelis were
killed by a Hezbollah roadside bomb in south Lebanon and followed
a Hezbollah Katyusha attack on Israel's north which wounded at
least 14 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses the Israeli forces suffered in south Lebanon have
sparked heated debate in Israel on the wisdom of maintaining
troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas, while Lebanon's
resistance led by Hezbollah started to surge.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Israeli cabinet endorsed the
20-year-old United Nations Resolution 425 but conditioned the
implementation on Beirut's guarantees for its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer and asked Israel to leave the
country without any preconditions as stipulated in the
resolution.

incumbent Bosnian Serb leaders in Bosnia's September general
election and will approve 100 million U.S. dollars in assistance
to the Serb entity by the end of the year, according to reports
reaching here Sunday.
</P>

The U.S. commitment is based on condition that Bosnian Serbs

</P>
<P>
Albright said she reminded the Bosnian Serb leaders that the
Dayton agreement could bring jobs and income to the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
What's more, she added, if Bosnian Serbs implemented the
accord, especially the parts stipulating the return of refugees
and arrest of war criminals, they would get as much as one third
of the U.S. aid package for the entire Republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Bosnia consists of the Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters that the Bosnian Serb leaders promised
they would implement all the clauses in the Dayton accord, as they
had done before.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, Albright said that the violence must stop
and the issue could only be resolved through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the United States nor the European Allies can tolerate
much longer" what is going on in Kosovo, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns over the refugee exodus from Kosovo,
Albright announced that the U.S. would add 20 million dollars to
its assistance to the refugees.

evening for talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and

Agassi has resurrected his career this year after a miserable
1997 which saw him fail to win a title and finish the year ranked
122nd. He has vaulted to the top 10 in the ATP rankings with four
titles and his 50 match wins -- including 44 on hardcourts --
lead the ATP Tour.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Stresses Strict Implementation of Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 30 (Xinhua) --Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
Sunday reiterated the strict implementation of the Dayton Accord
to resolve the Bosnian crisis, which he warned is not yet
completely over.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference here with visiting U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright after their hour-long meeting, Tudjman
described as "unacceptable" any attempt to revise the Dayton
agreement that ended the 1992-95 Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country had vital interests in a peaceful
resolution to the Bosnian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Croatia "is obliged by its constitution to take care of Croats
outside the Republic of Croatia," Tudjman noted.
</P>
<P>
Croats now account for 12 percent of Bosnia's population.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to help establish a special
relationship between Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said Croatia would continue all-round cooperation with
the United States and expressed the hope that Albright's visit
would help further improve Croatia's relations with the United
States, Europe and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her part, said the United States would continue to
support Zagreb's efforts to build democracy and develop economy.
</P>
<P>
She praised Croatia for making "some good progress" in letting
Croatian Serb refugees return to their homes as well as in
cooperating with the international tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"Modern Croatia should welcome home all people that lived here
before the war," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She also urged Croatia to do more in its political reforms and
respect for a free media.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Albright met with Croatia's opposition
leaders, Archbishop Josip Bozanic and independent journalists
before going to Bosnia to give support for September's general
election there.

GENEVA -- Following some easing of market tensions in Asia in
the earlier part fo the year, a new round of turbulence erupted in
Asia in the second quarter of 1998, said the Basle-based Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) in a report to be published Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Nervousness about economic and financial conditions in Japan
accentuated the coolness towards yen-denominated assets," said the
BIS in its report of International Banking and Financial Market
Development.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, problems of policy credibility in several
Asian countries put downward pressures on currencies in the
region, with markets paying increasing attention to the risk of a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan," it said.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said that these events, together with the weakness of
commodity prices and, in some countries, political uncertainty,
initiated a new wave of contagion to other emerging market
economies, triggering a flight towards the perceived safe-haven
markets of the United States and Europe. (Asia Financial Crisis)

<HEADLINE> Communist Leader Opposes Chernomyrdin's Nomination as PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia's three major party
leaders expressed their opposition Sunday to the appointment of
Viktor Chernomyrdin as Russian prime minister, casting a shadow
again over the solution to the Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Communist Party, said
Sunday at Russia's Independence TV program that he would persuade
all Communist parliamentary members to vote against Chernomyrdin's
nomination at the Duma (lower house) meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Communist parliamentary fraction will not sign the
political agreement drafted by Russia's interim government and
parliamentary leaders Saturday in a bid to end the country's
crisis, said Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give legislators more powers over Cabinet
appointments and government policy in exchange for quick
confirmation of the nomination. But Zyuganov said the agreement
could not guarantee anything to anybody.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who respectively
lead the Yabloko bloc and the Liberal Democratic Party, also
voiced opposition to the nomination on the TV program.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, President Boris Yeltsin brought back Chernomyrdin
as prime minister to replace the young Sergei Kiriyenko, who
stayed in office for only two months, in the hope that the
familiar figure would help curb the worsening trend of the
country's economy.

2,854 million U.S. dollars during the 1997-98 fiscal year, up 5.63
percent from the preceding 1996-97 fiscal, a press report here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, which accounted for 9 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), was the result of trade
imbalance between the country's imports of 8,015 million dollars
and exports of 5,160.2 million dollars during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1998, The New Nation daily quoted the central
bank, Bangladesh Bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports and exports in the past fiscal year
registered a growth of 8.60 percent and 16.82 percent respectively
over the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Imports from India alone accounted for over 15 percent of the
country's total imports, while exports to India took up only
around 1.3 percent of its total exports.
</P>
<P>
In the total export earnings, the contribution of garment
sector was 55.1 percent, followed by hosiery and knitwear 18.2
percent, jute and jute goods 8.3 percent, and frozen food 5.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Remittances of Bangladeshi nationals working abroad amounted to
1,433 million dollars in fiscal 1997-98, short of the
government-targeted 1,700 million dollars and a slight decrease
from 1,475 million dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year.

DALIAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the negative impact
of the Asian financial crisis, the exports of this seaport city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province registered continuous growth
in the first seven months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the exports of the city reached
1.32 billion U.S. dollars during the period, up nearly 30 percent
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the achievement to the marketing strategy of
local foreign-funded enterprises which resulted in timely changes
of focus from Southeast Asian countries to Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The growth also is the result of optimizing the export products
structure, insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic products and clothing used to be Dalian's major
exports, but these have been replaced by electronic products and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
The city currently has 6,500 foreign-funded firms, with a total
investment of 22 billion U.S. dollars.

BELGRADE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's mass media
reported Sunday that 22 kidnapped Serb civilians were killed by
Kosovo ethnic Albanian rebels in the village of Klecka.

Yugoslav authorities accused the ethnic Albanian rebels of
killing the Serbs and burning their bodies in a crematory in the
village Serb forces recaptured this week, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The victims include women, children and the old, said the
reports. The alleged crematory was found based on testimony from
two captured rebels who told police that at least 22 Serbs were
killed in July.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry issued a statement, appealing to
other countries for support of its fight against terrorism,
Various parties of Yugoslavia condemned the massacre.

the past seven months, including 125 ethnic Serbians and
Montenegrins as well as 37 ethnic Albanians loyal to the Serbian
authorities, the official Tanjug news agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian voters, in a
national referendum Sunday, rejected a proposed constitutional
reform intended to allow the incumbent president to seek
reelection.
</P>
<P>
With 82.6 percent of ballots counted, the anti-reform side won
63.7 percent of the votes in the referendum against 34.5 percent
for reform supporters, or 595,960 votes to 322,935.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
The reform would eliminate the constitutional restriction that
does not allow President Ernesto Perez Balladares to be reelected
to another five-year term unless he sits out two terms.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the reform said the permission of immediate
presidential reelection will assure smooth handover of the Panama
Canal and U.S. military land scheduled for December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the critics against the reform hold that such reform
would bring back dictatorship to the country.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the initial results of the referendum were
announced, the president praised the referendum as proof of
Panama's growing strength as a democracy and said he would proudly
hand power to his successor next year.
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that Perez Balladares was trying to hold power
to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary Party in the best
position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999, handover of the Panama
Canal.
</P>
<P>
Panama's next president will be elected in May and take office
in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand
is eyeing Europe and Japan as possible alternatives for the
government's global bonds since market conditions in the United
States became unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. financial market is virtually closed to all Asian
countries and Thailand will have to look for new trading places to
sell the bonds, the Bangkok Post said Monday, quoting government
spokesman Akrapol Sorasuchart.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry plans to issue 200 billion baht (5 billion
U.S. dollar) worth of the bonds internationally to generate income
to restructure the debts of the Financial Institution Development
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Chatumongol Sonakul has said the
government would have to offer interest rates of up to five
percentage points above those paid on U.S. treasury bills, of
about 12 percent, if the bonds were issued in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bonds carrying such high rates would become risky when they
were traded in the secondary market, and the initial subscribers
might face huge losses.

<HEADLINE> Asia Wealth Bank Leads in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Wealth Bank (AWB), a
local private bank in Myanmar, has become a leading financial
institution among the 21 of its kind with 16 branches operating
across the country, The New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The other two leading banks are the Yoma and the May Flower.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, people's savings at the
private banks constituted 38 percent of the total which reached
101.35 billion kyats (337 million U.S. dollars) at the end of
1997, increasing by 13 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the ties among the private banks, six of
them reached an accord in June 1997 on internal remittances among
them.
</P>
<P>
Among the private banks, seven are allowed to carry conduct
foreign exchange transactions in the wake of the country's
expanding foreign trade activities.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial reform has now entered the second phase
after memorandums of understanding on setting up joint venture
banks were signed respectively between six Myanmar private banks
and six foreign ones, which have already opened representative
offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 49 foreign banks from 16 countries and regions,
mostly from Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore, Malaysia and the
Republic of Korea, have set up representative offices in Myanmar
since the country reformed its financial management system in line
with the market-oriented economic policy introduced in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Steel Mill Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
privatized a state-owned steel mill here by leasing it to local
private entrepreneurs for continuous running at full capacity and
boosting production.
</P>
<P>
According to a lease contract signed on Sunday between the No.3
State Mining Enterprise and the National Industrial Holding Ltd.,
a local private enterprise, the latter is to invest in
manufacturing steel and other construction materials after taking
over the Ywama Steel Mill in Yangon, the New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The steel mill is the first largest industry leased out since
Myanmar began its privatization plan in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase privatization plan of the country covers 51
state-owned economic enterprises including processing and
manufacturing factories, cinemas and livestock breeding farms.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process has been under way in various forms
including auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or
establishing joint ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs
or operating either under buy-back or counter-trade system.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, about 140 state-run
cinemas, some 42 factories and two livestock breeding farms were
designated to be sold through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills have been
reportedly privatized.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's gross domestic
product in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in March, grew by
4.6 percent over the previous year, in which the private sector
contributed 75.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Discover New Ozone-destroying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists said
Monday they had discovered a new ozone-destroying chemical in the
atmosphere, as positive signs emerge that damage to the ozone
layer should decline in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Halon-1202, which has an ozone depletion potential
approximately half that of the common chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
has increased five-fold in the atmosphere since the late 1970s,
the Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), the leading national research group in Australia, said in
a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figures were obtained by collecting the measurements of
pristine air at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Cape Grim
baseline air pollution station in northwestern Tasmanian state.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years the atmospheric concentration of
halon-1202 has been growing at 17 percent per year, the
organization said.
</P>
<P>
"The source of the new halon is a mystery, adding to
scientists' concern over its potential impact on the ozone layer,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer, located about 24 km above the earth, is a
shield against the sun's deadly ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
Paul Fraser, an expert from CSIRO Atmospheric Research, said,
"The rapid growth of halon-1202 comes as a surprise to us."
</P>
<P>
Fraser speculates that gas may be by-product of inefficient
production of other halons in developing countries, and some
countries might be manufacturing halon-1202 for military
applications.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to consider imposing a
ban on production of halon-1202 in order to protect the ozone
layer.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with Correction) Romania: Budget Revision Triggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government has
begun debates over the draft Ordinance on the 1998 state budget's
revision, by reducing sums allocated to ministries by 8,000
billion lei (about 900 million U.S. dollars), about 10 percent of
the current budget and 2 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Since the spending cuts is the only way to cover a part of the
budgetary deficit, all the ministers have formally accepted it.
But the agreement of principle over this measure was not
automatically accepted by the Government members. It is known so
far that the National Education, Health, Culture and Transport
ministries are of the most hit, the reactions of the holders of
these portfolios are prompt.
</P>
<P>
The minister of the National Education Andrei Marga said that
his ministry's cuts by 1,000 billion lei (112 million U.S.
dollars) "are absolutely unacceptable and will have serious
consequences on education." He said that his ministry needs
another 800 billion lei (90 million dollars) this year and cannot
accept any reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Health Minister Hajdu Gabor in his turn says the
diminishing by circa 100 billion lei (11 million U.S. dollars)
will be extremely painful for his ministry, and specifies that
ways to face the situation would be giving up investments, cut
hospitals' spending and blocking vacancies in the field.
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Ion Caramitru shows no enthusiasm face to his
ministry's budget revision. The spending will drop 74 billion lei
(8.3 million U.S. dollars), which will affect firstly the already
started investments works.
</P>
<P>
The National Defence Minister Victor Babiuc is another unhappy
one. The ministry he runs will lose at least 4 percent of the
given budget.
</P>
<P>
The Prime minister said he supported the budget revision
proposed by Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu since "there is no
other better solution and an increase in the budget deficit can
not be accepted."
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Finance saw the revision as justified since
otherwise there could be a risk for the budget deficit to jump to
over 5.5-6 percent, from the initial target of 3.6 percent GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the government, no decision was made
till now over the issue and the draft Ordinance will be discussed
during an extraordinary government session on Monday.

The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> Rafter Beats Mantilla to Win Hamlet Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Patrick Rafter
won his final match before beginning defense of his U.S. Open
title, downing eighth seed Felix Mantilla of Spain 7-6 (7-3), 6-2
Sunday in the 315,000 U.S. dollars Hamlet Cup tennis event in New
York, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Rafter improved to 18-2 during the summer
hardcourt season with his fifth title of the year, the most by an
Australian since John Mewcombe won nine and Rod Laver claimed
five in 1974. Last year, he went 0-for-4 in finals before his
triumph at Flushing.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to lose going into the U.S. Open," said
Rafter,who played with a wrap on his injured Achilles tendon as a
precaution, "I started to hit the ball well, regardless of the
result. This is the best I've played over such a long period of
time. I'm confident now."
</P>
<P>
Rafter earned 45,000 U.S. dollars with his third victory over
Mantilla in as many meetings. The 25-year-old Australian is
seeded third at the U.S. Open, which begins Monday in New York.
The last player to parlay a win at the Hamlet into a victory at
the final Grand Slam event of the year was Ivan Lendl. Rafter
plays Hicham Arazi of Morocco in the first round.

<HEADLINE> Owen Detroy Newcastle's Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool's teenage star Michael
Owen destroyed Newcastle's dreams of a successful start under new
boss Ruud Gullit with a hat-trick in the first half at the
English Premier league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gullit had received the adulation of the St James' Park crowd
before the game but must have wished that he had Owen on his
roster as he watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool started the game with Steve McManaman in a roving
role, finding plenty of space and penetration.
</P>
<P>
After 17 minutes the Liverpool captain Paul Ince powered a
shot from 20 yards which Shay Given in the Newcastle goal could
only parry.
</P>
<P>
Owen nipped in from the right and finished on the near post as
Given struggled to get to his feet.
</P>
<P>
One minute later Owen was given a chance to run at the
Newcastle defence and he did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
The youngster's pace told as he left Phillip Albert for dead
and drilled his shot through Given's legs.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later Newcastle new-boy Stephane Guivarc'h sealed
his debut with a goal which was against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
But Owen completed his hat-trick on 32 minutes after running
past two Newcastle defenders and curling a shot with the outside
of his right foot past the despairing Given
</P>
<P>
Newcastle were looking for the half-time whistle to be blown
but a minute before the break Patrik Berger made a run down the
left before cutting inside and finishing clinically.
</P>
<P>
Half-time substitute Warren Barton, on for Serrant, allowed
the Magpies to play a more solid back four instead of three in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
Guivarc'h continued to win the odd ball in dangerous positions
but his partnership with Alan Shearer needs much more
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman's 62nd minute header looped over the bar as
Newcastle continued to have all the play.
</P>
<P>
Shearer then hit a powerful left foot effort but it struck
Babb as it headed for the bottom corner.
</P>
<P>
The game dribbled to its inevitable conclusion with Liverpool
having nothing more to prove and Newcastle struggling to find any
form.
</P>
<P>
Some of the usually ultra-loyal Newcastle fans left the ground
before the end of the game and Gullit will have to win the
confidence of the Magpies supporters after this crushing defeat.

<HEADLINE> Asia Suffers from Renewed Financial Turbulence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Following some easing of market
tensions in Asia in the earlier part fo the year, a new round of
turbulence erupted in Asia in the second quarter of 1998, said the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in a report
to be published Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Nervousness about economic and financial conditions in Japan
accentuated the coolness towards yen-denominated assets," said the
BIS in its report of International Banking and Financial Market
Development.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, problems of policy credibility in several
Asian countries put downward pressures on currencies in the
region, with markets paying increasing attention to the risk of a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan," it said.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said that these events, together with the weakness of
commodity prices and, in some countries, political uncertainty,
initiated a new wave of contagion to other emerging market
economies, triggering a flight towards the perceived safe-haven
markets of the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the repercussions outside Asia were more profound
than in the first episode of contagion, amplified by concerns
about the situation in Russia and in other countries suffering
form macroeconomic imbalances and/or the weakness of commodity
prices, oil in particular, said the BIS.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, in May, a number of non-Asian emerging market economies
were forced to further tighten fiscal and monetary policies," the
BIS said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a better differentiation of country risk by
international investors, the BIS said, Latin American debt was, at
the end of the quarter, still trading at a significant discount
compared with prices prevailing in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
"The resurgence of financial turbulence in the second quarter
of 1998 lent a new sense of urgency to addressing the issues of
crisis prevention and resolution," the BIS pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that national and international authorities should
continue to face difficult trade-offs, such as the need to
reconcile domestic and external constraints and to provide
liquidity while limiting the risk of moral hazard through an
appropriate sharing of the financial costs of crises.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Budget Revision Triggers Powerful Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government has
begun debates over the draft Ordinance on the 1998 state budget's
revision, by reducing sums allocated to ministries by 8,000
billion lei (about 900 million U.S. dollars), about 10 percent of
the current budget and 2 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Since the spending cuts is the only way to cover a part of the
budgetary deficit, all the ministers have formally accepted it.
But the agreement of principle over this measure was not
automatically accepted by the Government members. It is known so
far that the National Education, Health, Culture and Transport
ministries are of the most hit, the reactions of the holders of
these portfolios are prompt.
</P>
<P>
The minister of the National Education Andrei Marga said that
his ministry's cuts by 1,000 billion lei (112 million U.S.
dollars) "are absolutely unacceptable and will have serious
consequences on education." He said that his ministry needs
another 800 billion lei (90 million dollars) this year and cannot
accept any reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Health Minister Hajdu Gabor in his turn says the
diminishing by circa 100 billion lei (11 million U.S. dollars)
will be extremely painful for his ministry, and specifies that
ways to face the situation would be giving up investments, cut
hospitals' spending and blocking vacancies in the field.
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Ion Caramitru shows no enthusiasm face to his
ministry's budget revision. The spending will drop 74 billion lei
(8.3 million U.S. dollars), which will affect firstly the already
started investments works.
</P>
<P>
The National Defence Minister Victor Babiuc is another unhappy
one. The ministry he runs will lose at least 4 percent of the
given budget.
</P>
<P>
The Prime minister said he supported the budget revision
proposed by Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu since "there is no
other better solution and an increase in the budget deficit can
not be accepted."
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Finance saw the revision as justified since
otherwise there could be a risk for the budget deficit to jump to
over 5.5-6 percent, from the initial target of 3.6 percent GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the government, no decision was made
till now over the issue and the draft Ordinance will be discussed
during an extraordinary government session on Monday.
