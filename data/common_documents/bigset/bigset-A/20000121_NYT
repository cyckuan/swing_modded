ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS TO COMPENSATE MISSOURIANS RIPPED OFF IN
PHONE SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon on Thursday announced an effort to compensate at
least 10,000 state residents who were ripped off in a telephone
sweepstakes scam aimed at the elderly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nixon said at a Kansas City news conference that his office was
writing to 10,000 residents to let them know they share in $1.2
million recovered from Direct American Marketers, a bankrupt
Southern California company that Nixon won a judgment against in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's former owners were ``a crafty group of
people who wrote creative letters to fool people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's office originally won a $10 million judgment against
Direct American Marketers. But the company, unable to pay that
amount, filed for bankruptcy. Twenty-nine states sought
compensation. Nixon said Missouri recovered the most money.
</P>
<P>
   He said some victims of the phone scam lost as much as $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's office is sending letters to victims who lost at least
$100. Victims also can file a claim by calling a toll-free number,
(877) 325-3587. Or they can download a claim form from the attorney
general's Web site at www.ago.state.mo.us.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the sweepstakes fraud occurred in 1995 and 1998, when
the marketing company flooded the state with misleading mail
solicitations, many of which included copies of fictitious checks
for $7,500 and instructions to call a 900 number to claim a prize.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who called the 900 number were kept on the line for up
to 10 minutes and were charged nearly $4 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   After maneuvering through a thicket of voice mail messages,
consumers finally learned the most they had won was $1. By then,
they had racked up phone charges of more than $30. Many consumers
called the 900 number repeatedly. Some tried in vain to cash the
phony checks at banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said as many as 90,000 Missouri consumers might have been
ripped off by the defunct California company.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said he supported the General Assembly's
efforts to limit aggressive telemarketing. He also said his office
was compiling a list of consumers who don't want to be called by
telemarketers. Consumers can pay $5 to be on the list, which is
then given to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's office also has gone after direct-mail sweepstakes
companies, including Publishers Clearing House and American Family
Publishing. He said consumers should especially be wary of
sweepstakes claims in ads that appear on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to see through all the glitz and glamour of the
TV ads,'' Nixon said.

U.S. AID PREDICTED TO TURN COLOMBIAN DRUG TIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Despite a surge in Colombia's cocaine
production, a top Pentagon official Thursday predicted that a
proposed $1.6 billion U.S. aid package would help turn the tide in
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug production has increased dramatically and will continue
to increase if we do not take immediate steps, and that's what this
plan is about,'' said Louis Caldera, the secretary of the U.S. Army
who is on the final leg of a trip to Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence that this program will show
dramatic results in 18 months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money in the two-year emergency aid plan announced
by the Clinton administration last week would help Colombia's army
and police fight Marxist guerrillas, who are heavily involved in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   It would also expand a controversial policy of forcibly
eradicating vast plantations of coca leaves, the raw material for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package marks a sharp increase in Washington's
commitment to Colombia, which received about $300 million in U.S.
assistance last year. Colombia is the third leading recipient of
U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts say that the flow of Colombian drugs to the
United States is larger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Colombia
is expected to produce 330 to 440 tons of cocaine this year, up
from an estimated 220 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia supplies about 80 percent of the cocaine and the
majority of the heroin consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Soon-to-be released CIA estimates of Colombian land being used
to grow coca will indicate an increase of up to 50 percent in the
past year, according to Thomas Umberg, deputy director of White
House Drug Control Policy, who is traveling with Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   But Umberg said that more U.S. aid could reverse this trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's proposal, which requires
congressional approval but appears to have bipartisan support,
includes 38 helicopters for the underequipped Colombian army and
resources and training for three elite counterdrug battalions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to pave the way for a Colombian military
push into southern Putumayo and Caqueta states.
</P>
<P>
   Because this region is largely controlled by guerrillas who
attack police crop-dusting planes, pilots have been unable to spray
coca plantations in the two states, and coca production has
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy involves sending in counterdrug battalions to
secure drug-producing areas for fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S.-trained counterdrug battalion is already operating in
southern Colombia, and two more battalions will be activated later
this year, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   About 170 U.S. troops are training the counterdrug battalions.
But Caldera said that American soldiers will not take part in field
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to go down and control the area,'' Umberg
said. ``This is an (aid) package designed to really address the
problems in a comprehensive way in a relatively short period of
time.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; U.S. efforts to wipe out coca and promote legal crops have had
success in Bolivia and Peru, where drug production has dropped
dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Drug cartels responded by shifting much of their coca production
to Colombia, where the government is unable to control much of the
countryside due to a 36-year-old guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that even if coca plantations in Putumayo and
Caqueta are destroyed, the crop is so lucrative that peasants may
simply push deeper into the jungle to plant more.
</P>
<P>
   Umberg pointed out, however, that the U.S. aid proposal includes
millions of dollars for programs to encourage coca farmers to grow
legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Washington has refused to support alternative
development in Colombia due to fears that the money would wind up
in rebel hands.

BRADLEY DISCLOSES MORE BOUTS OF AILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley disclosed on
Thursday night that he had suffered four bouts of irregular
heartbeat, a recurring condition known as atrial fibrillation,
since Dec. 10, when he first said he suffered from the aliment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who takes daily medication for the condition, said that
in all four incidents his heartbeat returned to normal without
treatment. Several times he campaigned despite his fluttering
heart, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just the nature of the particular situation that, time
to time, its spins out,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation occurs when the heart's upper chambers
contract irregularly and faster than the lower ones.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley said one incident occurred just after Christmas
when he was on vacation. The others were on Jan. 6, 9 and 16. Two
of the incidents came the day after debates with Vice President Al
Gore in New Hampshire on Jan. 5 and in Iowa on Jan. 8. The third
incident was the day before the last debate between the two on
Monday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said he had been late in taking his medication before
one incident, but not the others. They also said the incidents had
lasted as long as 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, disclosed the incidents after his campaign
spokesman was asked on Thursday about his heart condition by an ABC
reporter. Asked why he had not been more forthcoming, Bradley said,
``You don't want me to go around disclosing every time I flip out
for an hour or two.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would tell reporters if he needed medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, Bradley canceled an afternoon of campaigning and
went to a hospital after a bout of irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the frequency of the recent incidents, which he
acknowledged were unusual, was not caused by campaign stress. After
the December episode, Bradley's doctor, Robert H. Heissenbutel,
released a letter about his condition that said that since Bradley
began taking medication for the condition in May 1998 he had had
``two brief episodes of atrial fibrillation.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides said on Thursday that after the most recent episodes
Bradley's doctors had said he did not need to cut back his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has absolutely no impact on the race or my capacity to have
a schedule or my intensity of campaigning,'' Bradley said.

KPERS APPROVES $40 MILLION SETTLEMENT WITH LAW FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas state
pension fund has approved a $40 million settlement with five local
law firms and agreed to dismiss malpractice claims over investments
that went sour more than a decade ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The so-called global settlement was approved last week by
trustees of the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System. The
agreement quietly ends most of the major pending claims brought by
the pension fund, which has been seeking to recoup about $265
million in risky investments it lost in the mid- and late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a settlement of all pending cases in which lawyers
have been named or all ventures in which they may have been
involved. As with all settlements, this was a compromise,'' said
KPERS' lead lawyer, Robert Coleman of Robert F. Coleman &AMP;
Associates in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement caps years of sometimes tumultuous litigation,
triggered by disclosures in 1991 that high-risk real estate and
other investments made by KPERS had cost the pension fund tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Kansas City-based Home Savings Association in
1991, which wiped out KPERS' $65 million investment in the thrift,
prompted an investigation by the Kansas Legislature and an overhaul
of the pension fund's investment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also authorized KPERS to sue those it deemed
responsible for the losses, triggering lawsuits against several
deep-pocket defendants, including law firms, accounting firms and
investment managers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brings to approximately $70 million the total
amount KPERS has recovered from more than a dozen defendants in
separate settlement agreements. None of the KPERS lawsuits, some of
them dating back nearly nine years, has gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The law firms involved in the settlement include some of Kansas
City's biggest: Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon; Blackwell Sanders Peper
Martin; Stinson, Mag &AMP; Fizzell; and Lewis, Rice &AMP; Fingersh. Also
involved in the settlement is the now-defunct law firm of Watson &AMP;
Marshall, which dissolved in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The firms represented KPERS in connection with the fund's
investments in a variety of business ventures, including Ward
Parkway Center; Emblem Graphics Systems Inc.; Home Savings
Association; the Kansas City Merchandise Mart (now the Overland
Park International Trade Center, Overland Park, Kan.); and Hydrogen
Energy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how the $40 million will be apportioned among the
law firms. Coleman said a final determination had not been made.
</P>
<P>
   All of the law firms were represented by the same insurer,
Attorneys Liability Assurance Society, which insures large law
firms outside of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys with the law firms were reluctant to comment on the
settlement, saying final documents had not been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all I can say is that an agreement in principle has been
reached,'' said John Noonan, a partner with Stinson Mag &AMP; Fizzell.
</P>
<P>
   William Carr, managing member of Lewis, Rice's Kansas City
office, said the firm agreed to settle in order to avoid further
disruption and expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in no way responsible for any losses suffered by
KPERS,'' Carr said. ``Had the cases been tried, we are confident
that we would have prevailed and been fully vindicated. However, at
this time we have taken the opportunity to move forward and put
this matter behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Voigts, a partner with Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon, said Shook's
portion of the settlement was ``substantially less than the cost of
our defense if these cases were to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement isn't allocated equally among the various
firms,'' Voigts said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the settlement will go to KPERS. After deducting
expenses advanced by KPERS, the pension fund's lawyers _ Coleman's
firm and the Chicago firm of Pavalon &AMP; Gifford _ will get 25
percent, or somewhat over $9 million. The two firms formed a
consortium, the KPERS Litigation Group, to represent the pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Williams, executive secretary of KPERS, said he was
``delighted'' with the agreement, calling it ``a huge settlement
involving major players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'd like to get a lot more than that when you
consider the losses involved,'' Williams said. ``But it's important
to recognize that some is just a flat loss that we're not going to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that, including the latest settlement, KPERS' net
recovery to date, after attorneys' fees and expenses are deducted,
comes to about $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeking more than $40 million, obviously, and had
(these cases) gone to trial, that potential existed. But when they
put that kind of an offer on the table, you have to look at the
risks you face in going to trial and beyond, on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our attorneys' recommendation and our board's decision
that $40 million sure did balance out those risks nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement leaves only a few unresolved KPERS claims. Among
them are claims against the pension fund's former investment
adviser, Reimer &AMP; Koger; Reimer &AMP; Koger principal Ken Koger; and
former KPERS chairman Michael K. Russell. All have denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest _ and earliest _ lawsuit filed by KPERS also remains
outstanding. That case, in which the pension fund sought to recover
its investment in Home Savings Association, was dismissed on the
grounds it was filed too late. KPERS, however, has petitioned the
U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, claiming the dismissal was
based on an erroneous application of Kansas law.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 million agreement represents the largest single
settlement of KPERS litiga date. The previous record was $10
million, which the insurer of the Gage &AMP; Tucker law firm agreed to
pay in 1995. Gage &AMP; Tucker later merged with another firm to become
Lathrop &AMP; Gage.
</P>
<P>
   Other large KPERS settlements over the last four years have
netted $6 million from former KPERS investment adviser J.W.
O'Connor &AMP; Co. Inc. of New York; $2.8 million from Boatmen's Bank
of Kansas City; $2.2 million from Bank IV of Wichita; $2 million
from KPERS investment adviser Callen Associates Inc. of San
Francisco; $1.5 million from a Wichita law firm; $600,000 from
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., a Kansas City investment banking firm; and
$125,000 from Spencer Fane Britt &AMP; Browne, a Kansas City law firm.
</P>
<P>
   KPERS, which now has $10.4 billion in assets, is one of the
largest 100 pension funds in the country. The pension fund manages
retirement savings for about 250,000 current and retired state
workers employed in more than 1,500 local government units.

LEADERS FROM TWO INDIAN GROUPS SEEK PELTIER'S RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Calling their meeting
a historic occasion, the heads of two groups representing most
Indian tribes in the United States and Canada met Thursday with
Indian activist Leonard Peltier at the U.S. Penitentiary in
Leavenworth, Kan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the four-hour meeting, members of the Assembly of First
Nations in Canada and the National Congress of American Indians
beseeched President Clinton to grant clemency to Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to consecutive life
terms for the 1975 slayings of two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Two other suspects were
acquitted, and a third was freed for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conviction, Peltier and his supporters have said that
evidence against him had been falsified. His supporters consider
him a political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked pretty strong today, but there are some serious
health concerns,'' said Ernie Stevens, a top official with the
National Congress of American Indians. Stevens said that while in
the penitentiary, Peltier had suffered a stroke and lockjaw, might
have developed diabetes and had lost most of the sight in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   In below-freezing temperatures with the limestone walls of the
prison in the background, Stevens and Phil Fontaine, the national
chief of the Assembly of First Nations, met with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Last July the two groups held a conference in Vancouver, British
Columbia, and agreed to work together to free Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard Peltier is innocent,'' Fontaine said. ``Because he is
innocent, he should be free.''

TRIAL CONTINUES AFTER DEFENDANT ESCAPES DURING BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- KC-DUH-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOE LAMBE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Douglas Holmes'
robbery trial was going against him Thursday, even before he
grabbed stolen cash out of an evidence bag and fled during a break,
prosecutors said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial went on without Holmes, who had been free on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Judge John R. O'Malley, who heard the
case without a jury, found the absent Holmes guilty of three counts
of robbery and three counts of armed criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   The repeat offender could be sentenced to six life terms.
O'Malley revoked Holmes' $50,000 bond and ordered him arrested. He
remained at large Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, ends a strange case of twice-stolen money.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Oct. 24, 1998, when an assailant robbed three
persons downtown in two incidents just minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the second robbery, a man in a stocking mask pointed a gun at
Sandy Behr in the parking lot of the Savoy Grill, 219 W. Ninth St.
As he took Behr's purse and drove off in her rental van, Behr's
friend ran and called police. Behr was in Kansas City on business.
</P>
<P>
   Police chased the van, and the man got out, threw a gun and
escaped on foot. A police helicopter's heat-seeking technology soon
spotted Holmes hiding in a giant trash container.
</P>
<P>
   Just months before his arrest, he had been released from prison
for convictions in 1987 for robbery and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Behr's wallet and jewelry and a stocking mask in
Holmes' pockets. His fingerprint was on the gun, according to court
records. He was charged in both robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such evidence at trial, Holmes, 30, of Kansas City
asked for time to talk in the courtroom alone with a relative about
whether to testify in his own defense. He instead left after taking
about $140 he had stolen before, mostly from Behr, said Amy
McGowan, an assistant county prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The second theft stunned Behr, who had flown in to testify
against Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I lost my money twice,'' Behr said, as she
prepared to catch a flight back.
</P>
<P>
   As for Holmes, she said: ``I just hope he's not on my plane.''

ESCAPE FROM POLICE CAR IS MAN'S FOURTH ESCAPE FROM CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tom Van Burk has done
some bad things: bank robbery, burglary and other felonies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But when it comes to escaping from custody, the Grandview, Mo.,
man is very good. And that has Missouri authorities scratching
their heads. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Van Burk escaped for the fourth time in recent
years. Authorities spent Thursday scouring Missouri for this
modern-day Houdini.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Randy Vick of the sheriff's department in Johnson County,
Mo., describes Van Burk this way: ``bound and determined.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Van Burk's legs were shackled in steel restraints,
his wrists handcuffed to his side. He was caged in the backseat of
a cruiser on the way to a state prison in Moberly.
</P>
<P>
   As an added precaution, they didn't tell Van Burk, 30, when they
would take him. He found out only hours before the 130-mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   But he was determined to escape, especially with a life sentence
plus 15 years awaiting him in Moberly for the Warrensburg bank
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile from the prison in Moberly, Van Burk rolled
down the back window a quarter of the way, as far as it goes.
Because the back door doesn't open from the inside, he needed to
open the door from the outside. To do that, he had to free one hand
from the cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   To pull his hand from the cuffs ``must have taken off a whole
lot of skin,'' Vick said. He has no idea how Van Burk escaped the
leg irons.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk reached out the window. When the deputy driving the car
realized what he was doing, he sped up on the state highway.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk rolled from the speeding car. Authorities aren't sure
of the cruiser's speed, but the car left marks of about 15 feet
when the driver slammed on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chased Van Burk for 100 yards before stopping to
radio for help. Dozens of officers searched homes near Renick, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy just has a knack for this,'' Vick said. ``He's
demonstrated that he's willing to suffer all kinds of pain in order
to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   He was still on the loose late Thursday..
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk is no first-time fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the 5 foot, 5 inch man somehow scaled a 12-foot
concrete wall at the Johnson County jail. Razor wires were waiting
for him at the top. He was badly cut and was recaptured quickly
outside the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Vick still shakes his head at the story of one of Van Burk's two
escapes from the Cass County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk took his clothes off, greased himself with cooking oil
and slithered through an air-conditioning duct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't have thought that a human being could get
through that small of a space,'' Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk's tenacity is what makes him dangerous. He has nothing
to lose, authorities warn. They think he stole a car early
Thursday. The vehicle is a burgundy 1980 Plymouth minivan with
Missouri license 807-JYX.
</P>
<P>
   Van Burk is 125 pounds, with brown eyes, black hair and a dragon
tattoo on his right arm. He has self-inflicted slash marks on his
left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Van Burk has relatives in the Kansas City area
and might be headed to Kansas City or southeast Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Grandview police have been alerted about Van Burk. He has been
in trouble with the law since he was a juvenile, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used a weapon in that (Warrensburg) armed robbery, so that
means he might use one again,'' Grandview Police Sgt. Kent Bruce
said. ``And he obviously doesn't want to be incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should be careful with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information should call the Johnson County TIPS hot
line at 660-747-TIPS (660-747-8477).
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Johnson County sheriff has had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is personal with me now,'' Sheriff Charles Heiss told The
Associated Press on Thursday. ``This is something I am not going to
let rest. This guy is a menace to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Missouri has any facility capable of holding
him.''

CUBAN BOY'S GRANDMOTHERS ARE SET TO FLY TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for new material, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration issued visas on Thursday
to the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, allowing the two
women to travel to the United States from Cuba and setting up a
custody showdown on American soil between two sets of the Cuban
boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomatic mission in Havana granted the visas as a
delegation from the National Council of Churches landed in Havana
on Thursday night with plans to escort the two women to New York on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments in the international custody case
virtually guarantee that a dramatic tug-of-war over the boy will
occur in the United States between Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
who is seeking permanent custody of the boy, and Elian's
grandmothers, who have said repeatedly that the boy should be
reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue from an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 other people drowned fleeing Cuba, he has
been living with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal
grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, applied for the visas late on
Thursday afternoon, and the visas were granted in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found to be eligible and the visas were quickly
granted,'' said James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State
Department. ``We understand they will travel tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintana has told the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that
she wanted to travel to Miami ``for just five minutes'' to pick up
her grandson. Ms. Rodriguez, whose daughter died trying to reach
the United States, has been equally emphatic that the youngster
should return to Cuba to live with his father. The boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has said repeatedly that he wants Elian to
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the National Council of Churches had made the decision to fly
the two women to New York instead of Miami to avoid a confrontation
with Cuban-American demonstrators in Florida who have demanded that
the boy remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the council, which in the past has said that the
boy should be reunited with his father on the island, did not
return calls on Thursday night for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Cuba had suggested that the chartered jet that took
the church delegation to Havana on Thursday night might be used to
fly the boy's grandmothers to the United States. But the plane left
Cuba shortly after it arrived, without the two women. It was
unclear if the jet would return to Havana on Friday, or if the
church group would find another way to fly them to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, leaders of the group, which is based in New York,
traveled to Havana and met with the boy's father and relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Thursday night that they
welcomed the visit by the grandmothers because they assumed that it
would create sympathy for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's position.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said on Thursday night
that Rangel planned to meet with the two women in New York City on
Friday. Rangel will offer to help the women make their case that
the boy belongs in Cuba, said Emile Milne, a press secretary for
Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   Milne also said it was his understanding that the women intended
to take Elian back to Cuba. ``Their mission is to bring him back,''
he said. ``I don't think anyone can be certain that it will happen,
but that's their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Miami on Wednesday that challenged the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling on Jan. 4 that the
youngster belongs with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had considered going to court to ask
a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in an effort to
resolve quickly what has evolved into a highly emotional, extremely
difficult political and diplomatic quandary.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official denied that the grandmothers' visit
was intended to circumvent the legal process. ``Presumably,'' the
official said, ``the two grandmothers can speak better for the
father's interests than the boy's great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that the father did
not travel to the United States because he did not want to be drawn
into the court battle over custody.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that Justice
Department officials would move as quickly and as vigorously as
possible to resolve the matter in federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything that can be done to have the matter
heard appropriately and promptly, with the recognition that it does
the child no good to be in limbo,'' Reno said at her weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said repeatedly that the government's
decision that the boy should return to Cuba was not affected by
politics and had been made by midlevel officials who applied the
facts and the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials have acknowledged, however, that
Elian's custody has meaningful ramifications for U.S.-Cuba
relations and for relations between the administration and leaders
of the politically powerful Cuban-American community in Florida.
The case, they admit, has been discussed at the highest levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 14 people who tried to sail to the Florida coast
from Cuba in a 17-foot aluminum boat, which capsized. The boy's
mother and stepfather and nine others drowned. Elian, and two
others, were rescued after clinging to inner tubes in Florida
waters for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his fate has become the subject of an intense fight
between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Elian's great-uncle
argued that the immigration service had violated Elian's right of
due process. They asked a federal judge to prevent the agency from
returning the boy before it granted him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the great-uncle, Spencer Eig, told the Cable News
Network on Thursday night that the grandmothers would be welcome to
visit Elian in Miami but that they would not be permitted to take
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers whose expertise is family and immigration law
support the position of the Clinton administration, saying the
reunification of a parent and child is a cornerstone of immigration
law and INS practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is rather clear on this,'' said Eliot Lichtman, a
veteran immigration lawyer here. ``This is a federal issue for the
immigration service. They have interviewed the father and decided
the father has a loving relationship with the son.''

GOP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL JOHN MCCAIN USES A STAY-AWAY STRATEGY IN
IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
 CAUCUS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When John McCain came
here last week for the final Republican debate before Monday's
caucuses, he followed his usual Iowa routine:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fly in. Take part. Leave.
</P>
<P>
   That meant no town meetings, no speeches, no meetings with
supporters in the state that launches the presidential selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   The man seen by many as the chief challenger to Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has no organization here and, strange as it may
seem, he wants it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assiduously said, `No stickers, no fliers, nothing,' ''
said Joan Fitzpatrick Bolin, a McCain supporter who comes as close
as anyone to being a campaign figurehead in Iowa for McCain. ``I
have been directed specifically not to campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusual, yes. But McCain's approach is in keeping with his
overall strategy for wrestling the GOP nomination away from Bush,
whom many regard as the presumptive nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Even by doing nothing, McCain still hopes to finish in the top
three, a development that could give him a boost heading into the
New Hampshire primary eight days later on Feb. 1. For reporters, it
would provide an appealing story line that even with no campaign,
McCain managed to scratch out a top-tier finish.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-risk approach. Even if McCain places out of the
running, he has invested nothing here, so how could the media blame
him for a poor showing?
</P>
<P>
   ``They hope he can exceed expectations and perhaps come in
third,'' Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa GOP, said of
McCain's campaign. ``That would get him one of the three tickets
out of Iowa. But the jury is still out in terms of whether the
strategy will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever went on to win their party's nomination without
finishing in the top three in Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some McCain supporters admit that his stay-away
strategy is risky. Voters in Iowa pride themselves on meeting the
candidates and asking them questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of feeling of being spurned,'' Bolin admitted of
her fellow Iowans. It's like not inviting someone to a party, then
asking that person to do you a big favor by backing you in the
caucuses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's nowhere to be seen here, he is omnipresent in
other early primary states, particularly New Hampshire, where he
leads Bush in many polls, and South Carolina, where he also hopes
to overtake the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iowa, ``I had to make a decision as to how we could spend
the limited assets and time that we have,'' McCain told reporters
Saturday. ``I don't have unlimited amounts of money as the other
candidates do to spend millions of dollars on television here in
Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what percentage of support he expected from Iowa, McCain
quipped, ``Half a percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are not high.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll taken by The Des Moines Register indicates
McCain is low-balling. He stood fourth in the GOP lineup with 8
percent backing. He trailed Bush who had 45 percent, publisher
Steve Forbes with 18 percent and former Ambassador Alan Keyes who
had 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an abortion opponent, calls himself a ``classic
insurgent'' candidate in the mold of Ronald Reagan. The party
bosses are backing Bush, but McCain battles on to give the federal
government back to the people, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A champion for campaign reform, McCain says he wants to ``break
this iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislative
action.''
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his tell-it-like-it-is approach, a claim he
accentuates by traveling New Hampshire in a bus dubbed the
``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first Republican debate in Iowa in December, McCain aimed
a shot straight at the state's farming underbelly when he said he
opposed subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based fuel additive that
helps boost crop prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you the things that you don't want to hear as
well as the things that you want to hear, and one of those is
ethanol,'' McCain said that night. ``Ethanol is not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment infuriated farmers, but it could help him in New
Hampshire and with some of Iowa's urban dwellers who long for a
straight shooter, said Dennis Goldford, who teaches political
science at Drake University in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, McCain also has said that he would shut down
the government, if necessary, to curb pork barrel spending by
Congress. And he'd name names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd make them famous,'' McCain said of his fellow members of
Congress. ``I'd go on the radio the next Saturday and say, `My
fellow Americans, I think you should know Senator X has $2 million
in this bill for manure handling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's no-nonsense image, as well as his compelling story of
heroism as a Vietnam prisoner of war, propelled him in the race's
early going. But lately, he has hit some snags.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized earlier this month following revelations that
he had written letters to U.S. regulatory agencies on behalf of
large campaign donors. Most of the letters McCain wrote, however,
were on behalf of constituents who made no contributions at all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stories suggested that McCain the campaign-reform
crusader was hardly pure.
</P>
<P>
   He also has taken hits for waffling on the controversy
surrounding the Confederate flag flying over the Capitol in South
Carolina, a state many pundits say McCain must win to have a chance
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, questions arose about McCain's temper
and whether he was emotionally fit to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain appears to be moving past the problems. A University
of Massachusetts poll released Tuesday showed McCain maintaining
his lead in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In debates, he and Bush have jousted over tax plans, with McCain
supporting a smaller $238 billion cut over five years, about half
the size of Bush's and aimed squarely at the middle class. McCain
insists that his plan does more to pay down the national debt and
bolster Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   And he chides Bush for aiming his tax breaks at the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that Republicans were mostly concerned
about the working men and women of America,'' he said on the
campaign trail. ``I didn't know our concern was the wealthiest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain often proclaims that he's not afraid of losing. Bush, he
says, ``has got all the generals and admirals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the privates and corporals.''
</P>

UNTIMELY `T' COSTS TCU AGAINST FRESNO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A microcosm of TCU's problems this season
could be found in Myron Anthony's ill-timed technical foul late in
the second half of last night's 101-96 Western Athletic Conference
loss to Fresno State at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a Horned Frogs comeback, Anthony took a
celebration after a Bulldogs timeout a little too far. The 6-foot-6
junior power forward wandered to the Fresno bench, trash-talking
and gesturing while the rest of the Frogs had gathered at their
bench. Referee Dick Paparo slapped a ``T'' on Anthony, which led to
Terrance Roberson's free throws and an 86-81 FSU lead with 4:31
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (10-10, 1-3) would tie the score at 86 shortly thereafter on
Ryan Carroll's 3-pointer, so the technical didn't doom the Frogs.
Nevertheless, in a season where the Frogs seem to find new ways to
lose, Anthony's mistake was the season in a nutshell for TCU coach
Billy Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fought a lot of battles and not given up,'' Tubbs said,
``but the thing that disappoints me is in our learning process. We
don't learn from our past mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony and forward Derrick Davenport have received several
technicals this season, and most have come at inopportune times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \Rthe technical\S doesn't happen, I don't know if we win
the game,'' Tubbs added, ``but it puts us in a better position ...
That's typical of what's happened, and that's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs was careful not to criticize the call, but added: ``I've
yet to coach a game with that ref that he hasn't called a
technical. It's miraculous I made it through the game without a
technical.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night was the first Frogs game Paparo refereed this season.
</P>
<P>
   Paparo released a statement on the play: ``\RAnthony\S went into
the \RFresno State\S huddle and started screaming at the players. I
pulled him out. He went back in again and started screaming again.
That's when I hit him with a technical.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding TCU's problems is its propensity to dig itself into
a hole early in second halves. The habit might be an abyss the
Horned Frogs can't get out of for the remainder of the WAC season.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State's Courtney Alexander and Terrence Roberson tried to
bury the Frogs with a scoring barrage to open the second half.
Alexander scored seven points before TCU could call timeout 50
seconds into the stanza. Roberson added eight points, including two
3's, and Alexander tacked on a couple foul shots to complete a 17-3
run that opened up a 64-45 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, the Frogs were nearly run out
of the gym shortly after the break and needed the rest of the game
to try to mount a comeback. They couldn't make up a 21-point
deficit in last week's 90-86 loss at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs made a game of it against Fresno (12-6, 2-0), but poor
defense and poor decisions proved too much to overcome. After
pulling even after Carroll's 3-point shot, the Frogs allowed an
easy layup and three wide-open 3-pointers that pushed FSU's lead to
an insurmountable 10 (97-87) with 1:15 remaining. TCU could only
make it look close from there.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' 1-3 WAC record includes two losses at home and the
program's first loss ever to Hawaii. TCU has lost five home games
for the first time in Tubbs' six-year tenure at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two losses really got us down,'' said Carroll, who
had a team-high 27 points. ``I, for one, haven't given up. We still
have 10 games left until the conference tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs hasn't given up either, though he has said he has grown
frustrated with the Frogs' continual struggles. TCU's 10-10 record
marks the latest in a season the Frogs have been at .500 since the
end of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were competitive, but I'm tired of being
competitive,'' Tubbs said. ``I want to win.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Rudy Tomjanovich wanted to scream so many times. But before he
could get out a sound, shots that had too much frosting fell. One
too many passes turned out to be just right. Impossible dunks
became highlights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this, the rebuilt Rockets discovered Thursday night against
the Denver Nuggets, is what it's like to be on a roll. The
shot-clock buzzer sounds just after the shot goes up. Loose balls
find open teammates. Struggling shooters come off the bench and
can't miss. Every night somebody does something better or more
often than they had ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets strutted their way to their season-best fifth
consecutive win Thursday, outpacing the Nuggets 122-115 and
matching their most prolific scoring game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The win was their 11th consecutive against the Nuggets, their
longest current roll against any team and the Nuggets' longest
losing streak against any opponent. After three more home games,
the Rockets face the Nuggets again Jan. 28 in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But after all their struggles, the Rockets were more concerned
with their own progress overall than mastery of any one opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with anybody, if you're winning you get a lot of
confidence,'' Rockets forward Kenny Thomas said. ``It feels great.
We're happy. We're relaxed. We're playing together. We're helping
each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   They were so much more cohesive offensively, it didn't even
matter that they barely played defense for the first three
quarters. They played as if they knew they had more firepower than
the Nuggets could match, even with Sugar Land neighbors Antonio
McDyess, who had a season-high 40 points, and Nick Van Exel (31).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were playing family reunion basketball there for
a while, where you give cousin Billy his turn and uncle Joe his
turn and he's going to give you your turn,'' Tomjanovich said.
``But we did get some stops and we scored a lot of points. We made
big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   They started so quickly offensively, whatever the Nuggets did on
the other end seemed unlikely to matter. With guard Shandon
Anderson providing the team's fourth consecutive night with at
least one player getting a career-high something, the Rockets let
their scoring carry them until regaining Tuesday's intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to have a letdown after our big win against
Portland,'' Anderson said. ``We came out a little bit flat. We had
to put points on the board until we started playing some defense
and making some stops. Now we understand how to play down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson played so well, he never stopped playing. In his 48
minutes, Anderson had a career-best 13 rebounds and fell a point
shy of his career high with 26 points, 17 in the first quarter.
Along the way he made a career-best four 3-pointers on five
attempts and had five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shandon played an iron man's game, every second of the game,
and was just tremendous,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He shot the heck out
of it from the 3-point line, and I was going to go with him. He
didn't look like he eased up at all. He had energy, and he's a
great athlete, so he got his time and a little overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis had at least 20 points for the fourth consecutive
game, finishing with 22, along with seven assists and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had his third consecutive double double with 13 points
and 10 rebounds. And Cuttino Mobley, who had been 27-of-64 in his
previous five games, made seven of 11 shots for 17 points,
including two on one of those ``Oh, no way to go'' dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started having fun,'' Mobley said of his turnaround and
his team's swagger Thursday. ``I was pressing too much. I just
wanted to go out and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have confidence, when you're winning, that's the best
thing. Everybody is getting together, passing the ball. All of us
made big shots in the fourth quarter that in the beginning of the
season we weren't making. When you miss open shots in the fourth
quarter, you start thinking. We're having fun. We're just going to
go out, have fun, try to keep the streak going and try to protect
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hakeem Olajuwon, working his way back to form, can be
considered a master of timing. He had six points for the second
consecutive game, playing 18 minutes. But in his three games since
his return from hernia surgery, the Rockets are unbeaten,
sustaining their strong play as well as they have since last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I love it,'' Olajuwon said. ``The nice thing, the team
confidence level, the team effort is so high. The extra pass, the
effort coming down, playing to win, this is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Most telling of the Rockets' improvement might be turning around
the two areas of the game that had been their worst _
fourth-quarter execution and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets went from a point behind to a 10-point lead in the
fourth quarter. And for the first time this season, the Rockets,
the league's second-most turnover-prone team, had fewer than 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a celebration,'' Tomjanovich said, his
players starting in the locker room without him. ``It was the first
single-digit (nine) turnovers we had in, hey, in the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been competitive all year. We just haven't been able to
close them out. I said after those games, if we learn from those
things, and it does something to our nervous system like a boot
camp and we get something out of it, it's worth it. Now is the
payoff.''

CUBAN BOY'S GRANDMOTHERS ARE SET TO FLY TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for new 11th and 12th grafs concerning meeting Thursday night
between grandmothers and church council officials.) 
 (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration issued visas on Thursday
to the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, allowing the two
women to travel to the United States from Cuba and setting up a
custody showdown on American soil between two sets of the Cuban
boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomatic mission in Havana granted the visas as a
delegation from the National Council of Churches landed in Havana
on Thursday night with plans to escort the two women to New York on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments in the international custody case
virtually guarantee that a dramatic tug-of-war over the boy will
occur in the United States between Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
who is seeking permanent custody of the boy, and Elian's
grandmothers, who have said repeatedly that the boy should be
reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue from an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 other people drowned fleeing Cuba, he has
been living with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal
grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, applied for the visas late on
Thursday afternoon, and the visas were granted in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found to be eligible and the visas were quickly
granted,'' said James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State
Department. ``We understand they will travel tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintana has told the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that
she wanted to travel to Miami ``for just five minutes'' to pick up
her grandson. Ms. Rodriguez, whose daughter died trying to reach
the United States, has been equally emphatic that the youngster
should return to Cuba to live with his father. The boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has said repeatedly that he wants Elian to
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the National Council of Churches had made the decision to fly
the two women to New York instead of Miami to avoid a confrontation
with Cuban-American demonstrators in Florida who have demanded that
the boy remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the council, which in the past has said that the
boy should be reunited with his father on the island, did not
return calls on Thursday night for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Cuba had suggested that the chartered jet that took
the church delegation to Havana on Thursday night might be used to
fly the boy's grandmothers to the United States. But the plane left
Cuba shortly after it arrived, without the two women. It was
unclear if the jet would return to Havana on Friday, or if the
church group would find another way to fly them to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers met for about an hour on Thursday night at
the Cuban Council of Churches with officials of the National
Council of Churches, then left, silent and somber faced.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the American council officials left,
reminding reporters gathered outside that the discussions were very
sensitive and would be resumed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, leaders of the group, which is based in New York,
traveled to Havana and met with the boy's father and relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Thursday night that they
welcomed the visit by the grandmothers because they assumed that it
would create sympathy for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's position.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said on Thursday night
that Rangel planned to meet with the two women in New York City on
Friday. Rangel will offer to help the women make their case that
the boy belongs in Cuba, said Emile Milne, a press secretary for
Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   Milne also said it was his understanding that the women intended
to take Elian back to Cuba. ``Their mission is to bring him back,''
he said. ``I don't think anyone can be certain that it will happen,
but that's their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Miami on Wednesday that challenged the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling on Jan. 4 that the
youngster belongs with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had considered going to court to ask
a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in an effort to
resolve quickly what has evolved into a highly emotional, extremely
difficult political and diplomatic quandary.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official denied that the grandmothers' visit
was intended to circumvent the legal process. ``Presumably,'' the
official said, ``the two grandmothers can speak better for the
father's interests than the boy's great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that the father did
not travel to the United States because he did not want to be drawn
into the court battle over custody.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that Justice
Department officials would move as quickly and as vigorously as
possible to resolve the matter in federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything that can be done to have the matter
heard appropriately and promptly, with the recognition that it does
the child no good to be in limbo,'' Reno said at her weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said repeatedly that the government's
decision that the boy should return to Cuba was not affected by
politics and had been made by midlevel officials who applied the
facts and the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials have acknowledged, however, that
Elian's custody has meaningful ramifications for U.S.-Cuba
relations and for relations between the administration and leaders
of the politically powerful Cuban-American community in Florida.
The case, they admit, has been discussed at the highest levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 14 people who tried to sail to the Florida coast
from Cuba in a 17-foot aluminum boat, which capsized. The boy's
mother and stepfather and nine others drowned. Elian, and two
others, were rescued after clinging to inner tubes in Florida
waters for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his fate has become the subject of an intense fight
between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Elian's great-uncle
argued that the immigration service had violated Elian's right of
due process. They asked a federal judge to prevent the agency from
returning the boy before it granted him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the great-uncle, Spencer Eig, told the Cable News
Network on Thursday night that the grandmothers would be welcome to
visit Elian in Miami but that they would not be permitted to take
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers whose expertise is family and immigration law
support the position of the Clinton administration, saying the
reunification of a parent and child is a cornerstone of immigration
law and INS practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is rather clear on this,'' said Eliot Lichtman, a
veteran immigration lawyer here. ``This is a federal issue for the
immigration service. They have interviewed the father and decided
the father has a loving relationship with the son.''

BRUINS WIN SECOND IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ It's a juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not a juggernaut or the beginning of a huge turnaround
or anything else. Perhaps a modest winning streak is a more
realistic way to describe what is happening to Boston. Call it what
you want, but the Bruins have earned back-to-back victories the
past two nights and are unbeaten in five games (2-0-3).
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's 4-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Ice
Palace wasn't a work of art by any stretch of the imagination, but
when you're 48 games into the season and fighting to make the
postseason, aesthetics don't matter. It also doesn't matter that
the combined records of Boston's last two opponents is 22-56-11.
</P>
<P>
   After a monumental struggle for the past month and a half, the
Bruins are just happy to be pointed in the right direction. Well,
for the most part. Once again, with a comfortable lead at the end,
mistakes made it a little too interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said his position is like the Navy _ it's not
just a job, it's an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most adventurous team I've ever had in my entire
career,'' said Burns, shaking his head. ``We make every game an
adventure. Be all you can be. But they worked hard, I've got to
give them that. Everything just seems to be an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took a 2-1 lead into the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:11, Marty McSorley picked up his first goal as a Bruin.
McSorley, positioned at the right point, fired the puck through
traffic. It pinballed its way through and past goalie Kevin Hodson,
who has been in Lightning coach Steve Ludzik's doghouse and who is
in danger of losing his spot. Hodson faced 15 shots in the period.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Hodson's teammates were doing their best to
give the netminder some help. At 12:08, the Lightning came close to
tying the game when center Robert Petrovicky, one of the club's
most noticeable players, tried to beat Byron Dafoe (26 saves) near
the left post but the puck skidded through the crease along the
goal line and kept going out the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning pulled even at 12:59 when left wing Jaroslav
Svejkovsky potted his second goal of the year and first of two in
the game. Svejkovsky got the rebound of a teammate's shot, skated
it behind the net, and then skated it out in front. With Dafoe down
on his knees, Svejkovsky fired a shot that beat Dafoe to the short
side.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went on top for good at 17:17 when Joe Thornton
tallied his 12th of the year. Thornton, who played just over seven
minutes in the first period (nine shifts), was one of the Bruins'
best players and scored on a heads-up play.
</P>
<P>
   He was positioned behind the Lightning net and was looking to
center a pass to Steve Heinze. He sent the puck toward Heinze, but
Lightning defenseman Chris McAlpine blocked it and Thornton got it
back. He skated into the low edge of the right circle and wristed
it past Hodson for the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second period, which was scoreless, was one of the most
forgettable in recent memory. Both clubs were sloppy, there were
more icings than scoring chances, and neither team advanced its
cause. One of the only legitimate scoring opportunities came midway
through the period when Tampa Bay forward Darcy Tucker fired a shot
from the right point. Dafoe made the stop, but center Chris Gratton
got to the rebound. He tried to beat Dafoe at the left post, but
couldn't make the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' third goal came with a whole lot of help from the
Lightning at 8:32 of the third. Andre Savage was in the right
faceoff circle in the Tampa Bay zone, taking the draw against
Gratton. Gratton pulled the puck back but won it with so much zeal
that it went flying backward, caromed off the skate of defenseman
Paul Mara and right past Hodson and into the net. Savage was
credited with his second goal of the season. Ludzik, who watched in
disbelief, was so frustrated that he took the gum out of his mouth
and tossed it down the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so quick,'' said Savage. ``But I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that goal provided some needed breathing room for
Boston because Svejkovsky pulled Tampa to within 3-2 at 18:30, but
right wing Rob DiMaio sealed it with an empty-netter at 18:54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an evenly matched performance,'' said Burns.
``We got some timely goals, Byron made some timely saves. I thought
both teams were evenly balanced.''

BELL TOLLS FOR BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Belmont Learning Center is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after a rogue group of Los Angeles Unified
administrators and consultants dreamed up a plan to build the
nation's costliest high school atop an oil field, the district's
top two leaders are recommending that the $175 million project be
abandoned as a school.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the school board pledged to back the
recommendation and to fast-track efforts to relieve overcrowding
and reduce busing of students in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether the board would go along with the
proposal that interim Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines and Chief
Operating Officer Howard Miller made Thursday to use Belmont as a
new LAUSD administrative headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a potential high school the Belmont Learning Complex,
conceived in ignorance and nurtured by negligence, is a vortex of
contamination that would continue to draw energy, resources,
controversy and disaster,'' Miller wrote in his report to the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to decide, finally, that the site and buildings
will not be used for a school, and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Cortines found that much-needed classroom space for
the neighborhood in the Belmont attendance area could be provided
within a shorter period of time if the district focused on finding
alternative sites for a downtown campus.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Los Angeles school board members told the
Daily News that they would formally vote to scrap Belmont as a
school at the board's Feb. 8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After months of deliberations over the complex's fate, board
members Genethia Hayes, Julie Korenstein, David Tokofsky and
Caprice Young pledged to kill the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been against Belmont on safety issues,'' said
Hayes, the board president. ``There is nothing in this
recommendation that tells me I was off the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority, however, did not embrace a portion of the
recommendation that calls for the land to be used for
administrative offices and warehouse space. They also were not
pleased that the report failed to include details for an
alternative campus.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Castro, who represents the overcrowded Belmont
attendance area and has long been the project's leading champion,
rejected the entire report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough. If it's not going to be Belmont, what's it
going to be?'' Castro questioned. ``Give me the costs, give me the
time lines, give me the specifics. This once again falls short on
all of those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino community around Belmont has been promised a school
for more than 20 years. Castro said she will encourage community
groups to work with the American Civil Liberties Union to seek
ways, including litigation, to prevent Belmont from being
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives no long-term solutions to this area,'' she said.
``This community has voiced to me that they are fed up with ideas.
They want specific answers.''
</P>
<P>
   A brown stone-and-steel monolith, Belmont sits padlocked on a
sloping downtown lot sandwiched between freeways and surrounded by
low-income housing. The campus was never intended to be merely a
high school, but a ``learning center'' for more than 5,000 students
that would include a shopping mall and acres of parkland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated warnings, the school district and a development
team led by Kajima Urban Development started building the complex
without adequate safety systems to protect against explosive
methane gas and deadly hydrogen sulfide rising from the oil field.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive tests revealed last summer that the 35-acre parcel
cannot be cleaned up and the school may not be safe even with
costly mitigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, Miller and Cortines concluded that it remains
unknown ``whether the site can ever be made sufficiently safe for
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor and minorities, as well as the wealthy and
comfortable, are equally entitled to the safest schools. Any other
basis of decision amounts to environmental apartheid, a path on
which our society cannot go.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Belmont would take at least five years to complete,
while temporary, if not permanent, classroom space likely could be
ready within two years, said Cortines, who assumed control of the
district Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I just could no longer hold to the idea of
finishing Belmont,'' said Cortines, who previously supported the
complex's completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have seats in some temporary way for these students
by September of next year,'' he said. ``It's got to be about
finding seats.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the state has refused to provide any money to complete
Belmont and retrofit the complex with a mitigation system at a
combined cost of more than $100million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other school construction projects, money for Belmont has
come largely from the district's general fund, the same pool of
cash used to pay for books and supplies. ``That cannot continue,''
Cortines said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines suggested several potential sites for schools in the
Belmont area, including the vacant Terminal Annex post office, the
district's administrative headquarters and high-rise buildings
along Wilshire Boulevard. State and local bond money would likely
be available for these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the recommendations by Miller and Cortines was
sharply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive sign,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale, who spearheaded state efforts to block funding for the
project. ``The kids are the winners in this. We will build them new
and safe schools quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, said the
union feels vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of crap for opposing Belmont. The entire Latino
legislative delegation came down on us like a sack of bricks,''
Higuchi said. ``We're just glad the money that would have been
poured into Belmont now can be poured into badly needed school
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont's backers reacted with anger and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very irresponsible, outrageous and upsetting,''
said Angela Sanbrano, executive director of the Central American
Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sanbrano's group is part of a civil rights coalition that is
preparing a lawsuit to stop the board from abandoning Belmont, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Sen. Charles Calderon criticized the report's
conclusion that Belmont should be used to house the district's
administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's safe to work there, it's safe to go to school there,''
said Calderon, a member of a special citizens commission that
narrowly advised the district last October to complete the school.
</P>
<P>
   State toxic officials partially halted construction of Belmont
last February and the school board voted to padlock the site in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Two audits of Belmont last year by Los Angeles Unified's top
inspector revealed a cancer of incompetence in the district that
allowed the ill-fated project to be built and exposed widespread
financial abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic tests at the property were scheduled to be completed in
June, but will likely take longer because of delays by the
district, state Department of Toxic Substances Control officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tests still need to be completed,'' said Hamid Saebfar,
director of Southern California Clean-up Operations for the DTSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a different standard for safety when you are looking
at commercial uses of the land. The standards are easier to meet
than those for schools or residential housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see how they want to finish this.''

EX-RUSSIAN SPY TO DETAIL SOUTHLAND ESPIONAGE
</HEADLINE>
 TO TESTIFY-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Bill Hillburg  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A former Russian spy will come out of the cold on
Monday in Los Angeles to testify to Congress about ongoing
espionage operations in Southern California and weapons stockpiles
allegedly hidden away in the Southland and other U.S. sites.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislav Lunev, a former colonel in Russia's GRU intelligence
agency who defected in 1992, will testify before the House
Committee on Government Reform, which includes Reps. Henry Waxman,
D-Los Angeles, and Stephen Horn, R-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lunev, who is enrolled in the Federal Witness Protection
Program, will have his head covered by a hood during his testimony,
and his voice will be electronically altered.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will be open to the public and will get under way at
10 a.m. in the boardroom of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, 1 Gateway Plaza, adjacent to Union Station in downtown
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Committee spokesman Mark Corallo said Thursday that Lunev is
expected to give details on Russian espionage targeting Southern
California's defense and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be widespread espionage activity in the Los
Angeles area, and there may be quite a few of these arms stockpiles
in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lunev and other Russian defectors first revealed the existence
of the weapons caches in 1992. Since then, stockpiles of weapons
and explosives have been uncovered in Belgium and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. stockpiles have been discovered. Congressional sources
reported in November that the FBI had searched an alleged arms
cache site in Brainerd, Minn., but turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the alleged Russian weapons stockpiles rose in
November, when Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., raised the possibility the
spy caches might include suitcase-sized nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have confirmed their arsenal includes the
devices, which can produce a 10-kiloton blast. But there is no
evidence the nukes have been hidden in the United States by Russian
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lunev is right and there are in fact secret Russian arms
caches throughout this country, we must not sit idly by and let
this become a larger threat to U.S. security,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., who chairs the Committee on Government Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks ago, it was discovered Russian agents bugged the
State Department,'' he said. ``That alerted America to the fact
that espionage and secret operatives are not a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing Russian espionage in the United States was the
subject of Lunev's 1998 book ``Through the Eyes of the Enemy.'' In

see the United States as an enemy.

   CENSUS-KICKOFF (Unalakleet, Alaska) _ Stanton Katchatag, an
82-year-old Inuit, answered a knock on his door here on Thursday at
10:50 a.m. and found Kenneth Prewitt, the director of the Census
Bureau. Pulling out the census short form he asked Katchatag his

   CT-GREENWICH-SLAYING (Hartford, Conn.) _ On Wednesday, state
prosecutors charged Michael C. Skakel with killing 15-year-old
Martha Moxley in Greenwich almost 25 years ago, tight-lipped but
confident they had finally solved a baffling case. On Thursday, the
case seemed to be moving right along. A court date was set for Feb.
8, when Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy who has long maintained
his innocence, is to appear for a closed hearing to set a second
court date in which he can enter his plea. But that is where the
case will probably begin to bog down faster than rush-hour traffic

sperm needed to compete with one another. &UR;  &LR; By Nicholas Wade.

   THEATRICAL-WRITER (New York) _ One afternoon about three years
ago, Claudia Shear got the type of call young writers dream about.
Thus began a most unlikely creative partnership, between James
Lapine, the respected Broadway director and writer, and Ms. Shear,
the manic comic actress whose autobiographical play, ``Blown
Sideways Through Life,'' became an unexpected off-Broadway hit in
1993. The result of their three-year collaboration is ``Dirty
Blonde,'' an affectionate look at the lives of Mae West and two of
her most ardent admirers. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-ART (Undated) _ The history of American art at the end of
the 20th century is at least in part the history of AIDS. Despite
all this, AIDS went all but unmentioned in the recent rash of
retrospectives. One reason is simply that, with the successful use
of expensive palliative drugs since the late 1990s, the disease has
lost its aura of emergency for middle-class whites in the United
States. This is not the case, however, for the rest of the world,
where the devastation from AIDS has assumed hurricane force. And
that fact is evident in ``Bodies of Resistance,'' an exhibition at
Real Art Ways in Hartford organized by Visual AIDS. By Holland
Cotter.

Stratton, its tonier neighbor in the Green Mountains of southern
Vermont. But Bromley, a four-hour drive north of Manhattan, offers
congenial family skiing and snowboarding with a bonus: proximity to
the outlet mecca of Manchester Center with its designer shops of
discounted Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Gianni Versace, Dansk,
Godiva and other haut-branded fashions, housewares and edibles. In
short, all the makings for a perfect ``ski 'n' shop'' excursion. By

WRONG UCLA TEAM SHOWS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three weeks away from Pauley Pavilion, the
UCLA men's basketball team reintroduced itself to Bruins fans
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dear readers, that wasn't a typo. Since defeating Purdue at home
on the penultimate day of the 1990s, the Bruins have worn as many
faces as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   There was the sagging, sullen UCLA team that was there in body
but not in spirit in unsettling losses at Washington and USC. Then
there was the lively, alert Bruins squad that shocked North
Carolina in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Which UCLA team would fans see against second-ranked Arizona?
For the Pauley Pavilion faithful, it made for a more stimulating
guessing game than that ol' modern-day sports standby, the
electronic shell game.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the crowd of 12,202 saw the Bruins in all
their fame and inglory. The best thing that can be said of UCLA's
76-61 loss is they've looked worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins never looked better than when they got their
fastbreak into fifth gear behind the dervish rebounding of Jerome
Moiso. And the Bruins never looked more mediocre than when forced
into their half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA has a set play other than Jason Kapono pulling up to
take a three-pointer, Thursday would have been a really good time
to unveil it.
</P>
<P>
   Their exalted ranking notwithstanding, this was hardly the most
fearsome Arizona squad Lute Olson has brought to battle the Bruins
on their home court. Injuries have turned Arizona into Snow White
Lute and the seven scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
   All seven played and four of the starters, led by Michael Wright
and his 22 points, reached double figures in scoring. The fifth,
Luke Walton, who was making his first appearance in the building in
which his father, Bill, starred, had four assists and harassed
Kapono into a 10-turnover performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono vs. Walton was considered one of the key matchups. Wright
vs. Dan Gadzuric and Loren Woods vs. Moiso were the others.
</P>
<P>
   But the most lopsided matchup of the night proved to be on the
bench, where Olson clearly outcoached Steve Lavin. In the first
half, the Wildcats weren't able to get much offense from anybody
save for Wright and Woods. So at the start of the second half,
Olson brought Wright and Woods into the high post to break the
Bruins 3-2 zone.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso and Gadzuric, smoked out of the low post, found themselves
in no-man's land.
</P>
<P>
   The result? The inside opened up like a carpool lane for
Arizona's speedy backcourt of Jason Gardner and Gilbert Arenas. The
two combined for 30 second-half points as the Wildcats outscored
the Bruins 46-33.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for the Bruins: They showed more focus than they had
last week against USC. They just couldn't help flashing their wild,
undisciplined side. For some vain reason, they spent much of the
first half trying futilely to force an alley-oop basket down the
Wildcats' gut. It was as though they wanted to get the splashy play
that would lead the evening's sports highlights shows out of the
way early.
</P>
<P>
   Those shots were about the only ones that weren't falling early
for Moiso, who had 12 of his 22 points in the opening 20 minutes.
He was patrolling the paint as conscientiously as a night watchman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats made him virtually disappear in the second
half. If the Bruins aren't careful, their NCAA Tournament hopes may
go the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for UCLA: They are very good at rebounding. And we're
not simply talking about the battle of the boards, which they won
38-31.
</P>
<P>
   Our guess is they'll come out and execute much more crisply
against ASU on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new there with this team. The next game always seems to
be the most important one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Tennessee Titans are within one victory
of playing in their first Super Bowl, but the players who began
their careers as Houston Oilers have not forgotten their football
roots.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans, who have a six-game winning streak, defeat
Jacksonville in Sunday's AFC Championship Game, they will advance
to Super Bowl XXXIV at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The players and coaches are the toast of Tennessee, where they
are being treated like royalty because of their 15-3 record and
playoff victories over Buffalo and Indianapolis. But eight players
and three coaches remember, too, when they were kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been talking about how loud our new stadium is and
how unbelievable our fans are _ and they are _ but, man, I remember
playing in front of 60,000 fans in the Astrodome, and the noise was
so loud it would rattle your spine,'' guard Bruce Matthews says.
``I wanted us to have this kind of success in Houston, but it was
out of our (players') control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel for the people of Houston. I really do.
There are so many great fans there, and I know many of them are
pulling for us. I hope they're getting some enjoyment out of what
we've been able to accomplish as they get ready for their new team
to start playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, kicker Al Del Greco, cornerback Steve Jackson, safety
Marcus Robertson, safety Blaine Bishop, offensive tackle Brad
Hopkins, linebacker Joe Bowden and linebacker Eddie Robinson played
on the 1993 AFC Central champions who lost in the second round to
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Mike Munchak played in that 28-20 loss,
which became known as Joe Montana's last miracle. Defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams and strength and rehab coach Steve
Watterson were assistants when the Chiefs ended the Oilers' streak
of seven consecutive playoff appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we beat Indianapolis, I thought back to my playing days
in Houston and how we were unable to take this next step to the AFC
Championship Game,'' says Munchak, who is a finalist for the Pro
Football Hall of Fame Class of 2000. ``I thought about guys like
(Dean) Steinkuhler and (Jay) Pennison and Bruce Davis and how much
I wish they could be here with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about the fans in Houston, too. Football's
a business, and I felt sorry for them. The support they gave us was
phenomenal. Now that we're here, I'd like to see us win for them,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Munchak and Matthews played on seven consecutive playoff teams
that failed to advance beyond the second round. Jackson, who is
playing in his ninth season, is in the playoffs for the fourth time
after a five-year drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost in 1991 (at Denver), 1992 (at Buffalo) and 1993,
I always thought we'd have another shot next year, but then the
shots ran out,'' Jackson said. ``Now we've got another shot, and
we'd better take advantage of it because you never know when it's
your last shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we lost so many tough games through the years, when
games are close, I always have it in the back of my mind that we
can lose. Fortunately, there aren't that many of us who experienced
those losses. These young guys think they can't lose. Ignorance is
bliss, right?''
</P>
<P>
   As the Titans have prepared for the Jaguars, Jackson has been in
a nostalgic mood thinking about such former teammates as Cris
Dishman, Bubba McDowell, Sean Jones, Darryll Lewis, Lamar Lathon
and Warren Moon, all of whom reside in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure our success is bittersweet for those guys,'' Jackson
says. ``They're happy for us, but it hurts them, too, because
they're not a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they sowed the seeds for what we're experiencing now.
They established the tradition that we're trying to build on. I
wish we could have them all with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson grew up in Houston and played at Klein Forest before
going to Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and friends in Houston are fired up about the
Titans,'' he says. ``They tell me there are a lot of people in
Houston that are pulling for us. They deserve to experience this
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are still hard feelings in Houston, the players
understand. But they had no say in leaving after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we went through could have killed us,'' Jackson said.
``But it didn't kill us; it just made us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' last successful season in Houston was in 1993, when
they finished 12-4. They dropped to 2-14 in 1994, the biggest
one-season plunge in NFL history. Because of negotiations with
Tennessee, and the final agreement to move, the 1995 and 1996
seasons were a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The first two seasons in Tennessee weren't much better. They
played at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis in 1997 and Vanderbilt
Stadium in 1998. They finished 8-8 three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say if we'd be in this situation if we hadn't
gone through what we did,'' says coach Jeff Fisher, who came to
Houston as Jack Pardee's defensive coordinator in 1994 and replaced
him as head coach 10 games into the season. ``Looking back at the
last few years, I realize that we had to convince ourselves not to
use the circumstances as an excuse for our inability to get over
the hump. Now, though, I can see that I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to win when everything's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   When owner Bud Adams changed their name from Oilers to Titans
and the team moved into its Baptist Sports Park practice facility
and Adelphia Coliseum, the team became successful, posting a
franchise-best 13-3 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the fans in Houston lost something important to
them,'' Fisher says. ``They were the victims. I'm sure the pain has
been eased somewhat because of the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few weeks, we've gotten so many cards, letters,
e-mails, faxes and telephone calls from people in Houston offering
their congratulations and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco, who was signed after a tryout in 1991 when the team
blew a game at Washington, is so excited at the possibility of
going to the Super Bowl that he can hardly contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate what we have even more because of where we've
been. I feel so fortunate, and I'm enjoying the heck out of every
moment,'' Del Greco said. ``This team has the best chance of making
the Super Bowl of any team I've played on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1993 team had more talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more talent then, but it was individual talent,'' Del
Greco said. ``We weren't a team. Remember everything that happened
between Buddy (Ryan, the defensive coordinator) and Kevin
(Gilbride, the offensive coordinator). We're a team now. The
adversity we've gone through has brought us closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who joined the Oilers in 1990 as a quality control
coach under Pardee, has become one of the top coordinators in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how ironic it is that
after going through so many tough times in Houston that we're on a
roll now, and all those people who lived and died with us aren't
here to share it with us,'' Williams says. ``I've been thinking
about the early '90s and (John) Elway's drive in Denver and the
last-second field goal to beat us (26-24).
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the Kansas City game _ Montana throwing that
miracle pass, and Willie Davis making a miraculous catch even
though Dish (Dishman) had him covered. The Buffalo game? I tried to
put that Buffalo game out of my mind years ago. Until we beat them
in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that this Titans team has chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to evaluate players is when they're under stress,
because they can't fake who they really are,'' Williams says.
``These guys have proved over and over again they want to be here.
It's brought them closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overrate confidence, and we're a very confident team
right now. If you're not confident and doubt begins to creep in, it
can avalanche on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in a new stadium and practicing in a new facility make
quite a difference. I still have to pinch myself sometimes to make
sure they're real.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE last time Michael Jordan made a major midlife correction, he
retired from basketball to pursue his boyhood dream of becoming a
weak-hitting minor-league outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Which tells us that the most artful player of his day, and most
other days, isn't afraid to fail. This may turn out to be a very
valuable quality if Jordan finds only frustration in Washington,
where he was recently elected to the presidency of the Wizards.
Sources say that Elizabeth Dole has been ruled out as a potential
vice president, but Bill Bradley might be a fit. Meanwhile, a
fellow member in the NBA's 50 Greatest fraternity believes Michael
is doomed to a life of heartache in the nation's capital, as so
many are.
</P>
<P>
   Elvin Hayes, who spent the best years of his career there, and
helped give the city its only championship, wishes Michael nothing
but net. The problem, as Big E sees it, is simple. The Wizards have
three stars who soak up most of their money and haven't figured out
how to win. As he tries to rebuild the club, Jordan will find he
has no options. He doesn't need another star. He needs St. Jude,
the patron of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for basketball that Michael is back and has
a piece of the team,'' Hayes says. ``Abe Pollin is a fine man, the
kind you hope to work for, and the Wizards are a fine, family
organization. But what he accomplished as a player, Michael can't
accomplish in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-profile players they have under contract, they can't
move them. Nobody is going to rush out and take Juwan Howard, or
Mitch Richmond or Rod Strickland. That's going to be the thing that
ties his hands. Michael will be able to pack the arena. He can do
that just by being there and signing a few autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no room to move. You still have Juwan Howard with a
$100 million contract. Mitch is getting older. Young players
idolize Michael, and they would love to play for him. But they will
want to get paid. If you cut the guys you have, you still have to
pay them. How can he make any moves? I don't see him turning it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Hayes for a second opinion, and you can count on getting
one. ``I think Michael will play again,'' he says. People around
the league should not be surprised if he makes another comeback.
Once you have a financial interest in something, it's amazing what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy is having a press conference, you look at what he
says and what he's not saying. Will he practice with the team? Yes.
What are his plans? Whatever it takes to make this work. I think
that opens the door. And the fastest way he can improve this team
is to get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been retired since the end of the 1998 season, when
he stuck a jump shot as Utah's Jeff Hornacek flew toward him a step
too late, eyes shouting, ``Oh, no!'' Elevated, toes down, arm up,
he held the pose as Chicago claimed its sixth championship of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   How many times did we see him make that shot, or sail down the
lane, switch the ball from his right hand to his left in midair and
with a final twist of the body jam it into the basket? He doesn't
let himself get out of shape, and, at 37, you doubt that his
competitive instincts have shriveled. You can look around the
league and find dozens of players pushing 40. Of course, they never
had to live up to Jordan's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at heart and will and a player rising to the
occasion,'' says Hayes, ``there was no one better than Michael
Jordan. He may have been the greatest ever. He was for sure in the
top three.''
</P>
<P>
   His Airness may be able to inspire the Wizards by working out
with them, just by dripping his sweat on them. But the temptation
to play again, after he watches them lose for a while, may be
overwhelming. Magic Johnson came back, and made it to the Olympics,
and is still out there somewhere, touring with his own all-star
team.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's pride is off the meter, and you suspect that he
really wants to make executive decisions this time, winning with
his brain, not his vertical leap and hang time. Of course, he won a
few games with his brain, too. But you suspect that he would think
very long and hard about the risk of coming back and being a lesser
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   It was maddening the way his game fluctuated; 35 points one
night, 38 the next. Some games he came out smoking in the first
quarter, and others he waited to the fourth quarter to kick it into
high gear. There was no gear higher than Michael's.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he does, the NBA is a richer, happier league today
because Jordan is back. And if he doesn't decide to play again, if
he sticks to wearing a suit, he will continue to honor the game. In
this election year, with his wit and charm and popular appeal, he
ought to make a superb president.

DIRT TRACK AT TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY A `MONSTER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Gossage stood in the middle of the
latest addition to Texas Motor Speedway and realized the enormity
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge, huge place,'' Gossage said of the new 13,007-seat
Texas Motor Speedway dirt track. ``It is a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, the executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, is confident the track, which covers four-tenths of a mile,
will be filled with fans for the inaugural appearance of the
Pennzoil World of Outlaws Sprint Car Series here on March 30-31.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the track was a work in progress. But Gossage said it
will be ready in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Everything has ``gone better than we thought ... without a
hitch,'' Gossage said. ``That is the way it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Around and under the dirt-track surface will be features that
many such facilities in America don't have, including luxury
suites, a paved pit area, paved parking and a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The track will have 14 suites with the capacity to seat 308, but
the newest innovation will be its tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an opening in the concrete wall, which will
surround the rest of the track, in Turn 2, where the cars will
enter. The cars will exit the track through the tunnel, which will
start in the infield and go under turns 1 and 2 and lead into the
pit area behind the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still dirt-track racing, but it's nice to be able to
bring in your hauler on pavement and have a nice, clean place to
work on the cars,'' said Steve Kinser, the 15-time World of Outlaws
champion. ``These are the type of facilities we need now ...
facilities to hold the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fans have responded in large numbers. So many have shown
interest, Gossage said, that management might have to add temporary
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting with the Outlaw people last week, and they
are concerned that Sprint Car fans are used to walking up to the
gate and buying a ticket,'' Gossage said. ``There is a good
possibility you won't be able to buy a ticket the day of the race
at the current pace we are selling them. We are considering
possible temporary seats and some overflow ability.''
</P>
<P>
   A base for the racing surface has been built, but the dirt that
will top off the base has yet to be laid.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said that Devil's Bowl Speedway owner and promoter Lanny
Edwards will work with TMS officials on the surface, with the dirt
likely to come from a spot on the 1,500 surrounding acres.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the dirt common to most Texas tracks, Kinser will be
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, this black gumbo dirt around here ...
all the places I have been through Texas, they have some of the
stickiest race tracks,'' Kinser said. ``It can be one of the
slickest also when it dries out, but that is one of pluses there is
about this _ not having to go very far to find dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Outlaws races _ the second dates are scheduled for Oct.
12 and 14 _ are the only events on the dirt track's schedule for
2000. But Gossage said there could be additions. A race for the
Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Late Model Series has been discussed but not
completed, Gossage said. An end-of-season event for local racers
could be part of the schedule, along with future motorcycle races.
</P>
<P>
   But Gossage reiterated that the track will not run on a weekly
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take away dates from the local guys,''
Gossage said, ``because every Saturday night we run hurts them.''

TEXAS TRACK STILL WAITING ON FOR SECOND NASCAR DATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway developer Bruton Smith
said a second NASCAR Winston Cup race date is ``long overdue'' at
his $250 million facility in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have had it this year,'' said Smith, referring to
the 34-race 2000 Cup schedule that includes the DirecTV 500 in Fort
Worth on April 2. ``We've been waiting, waiting and we should have
had that date this year. I think it's long overdue. Not just the
speedway, but racing per se, and NASCAR needs that other date here
because this is a tremendous market for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and
general manager, addressed the thorny subject during the track's
``Texas Tour 2000'' preview yesterday. Smith and Gossage said the
speedway, which opened with a sold-out Winston Cup race in April
1997, already is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be profitable for another 30 years,'' said Smith, the
chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Speedway
Motorsports Inc. ``Here again, we'd like more profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Gossage called upon NASCAR to make good on the
promise of a second Cup date at the 1.5-mile quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that your word has to mean something,''
Gossage said. ``And we went out and spent $250 million of his
\RSmith's\S dollars based on a promise. Boy, that's a pretty big
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith secured TMS' current Cup date after buying half of North
Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway and receiving permission from NASCAR
president Bill France Jr. to move one of its two dates to Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill France asked me four or five years ago to help build
NASCAR _ well, I've done that,'' Smith said. ``I've done my part.
That's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage reiterated that ``several high-ranking NASCAR
officials'' have promised him and Smith that TMS eventually would
receive a second Cup date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough thing is if I stand here and tell you these things,
I'm going to hear back from Daytona Beach about it,'' said Gossage,
referring to NASCAR headquarters. ``I don't want to stir up
anything. I want to do whatever it takes to get that second race.
If that means biting my tongue or setting something on fire or
whatever it is _ I want the second race. Our fans deserve it.''
Road-course panned The proposed design of a 2.44-mile road course
in the track's infield met with lukewarm response yesterday. The
road-course, which will measure 1.05 miles of the total 2.44-mile
distance, will be built after the Cup race this spring to
accommodate the initial visits of the American Le Mans Series and
BF Goodrich Trans-Am Series on Sept. 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Bobby Archer, the reigning Speedvision World
Challenge GT champion, was critical of an ALMS-mandated chicane
designed to slow the cars through Turn 1, the lack of elevation
changes and the overall tight confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty lame,'' Archer said. ``But I think it's do-able.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the design has not been finalized, and he is
studying two alternate proposals submitted by three-time
Indianapolis 500 champion Johnny Rutherford of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a Mickey Mouse course, and that's not `it'
yet,'' Gossage said. ``I don't think you're going to please any
racer with any oval/road course, anywhere in the country.'' Seating
increased Installation of 16,000 temporary seats will raise the
speedway's capacity to 173,161 for the NASCAR Busch Grand
National/Cup weekend this spring.
</P>
<P>
   TMS' permanent seating capacity is 154,861. Another 2,300 fans
occupy condominium seats on race-day, Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary seats are being installed in turns 2, 3 and 4, Gossage
said. Combined with an estimated infield capacity of 53,000, more
than 220,000 fans are expected to be on-site for the Cup race.

KINGS LOSE AGAIN TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe this is not the (ital)year(end ital) the
Kings end their winless string against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   There is something eerily similar to all three losses to the
Stars this season, including Thursday's 5-2 defeat that put the
usually loyal Staples Center crowd of 14,369 in a lousy mood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind, came back to get the place excited, then
went quietly as Mike Modano and Brenden Morrow scored late to run
the Stars unbeaten streak to 21 games against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line tonight was we just played the worst 40
minutes we've played all year in the first two period,'' said Marko
Tuomainen, who cut the Stars lead to 3-2 early in the third period.
``We were losing every battle. Against a team like Dallas, if you
do that. It doesn't matter how hard you play in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters, but this has not as one-sided a slump as it
looks. Five of the six games last year were decided by one goal and
the first this season was decided in overtime. But there is a
reason the Ki ngs have not beaten the Stars since April 6, 1995.
Dallas never lets up.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ingredient that led the Stars to the Stanley Cup champ
ionship last season and has them climbing the Pacific Division
despite s erious injuries to several top players, including Modano.
</P>
<P>
   They were coming off a 3-1 loss to the Mighty Ducks on Wednesday
, but they were still the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is a real smart hockey team,'' Kings coach Andy Murray.
``They didn't have a lot of energy tonight but they played smart.
It is no wonder they have so many Stanley Cup rings in that room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who ended a three-game losing streak Tuesday by
beating Buffalo 5-3, remain seventh in the Western Conference
playoff race with 48 points, one ahead of idle Calgary. And things
don't get much easier. They play the streaking Colorado Avalanche
in a Sunday matinee.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the Kings get the Stars again next Wednesday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sound so bad when Marko Tuomainen cut the Stars lead
to 3-2 wtih a short-handed goal. Len Barrie was off for holding
when Tuomainen beat Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour, who stopped 28 of
31 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had built a 3-0 lead on power play goals by former King
Darryl Sydor and Brett Hull in the second period and a score by
Blake Sloan early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Overall the Stars first line of Modano, Morrow and Sloan
combined for three goals and five assists.The Kings first line of
Ziggy Palffy, Bryan Smolinski and Luc Robitaille had no points.
Smolinski did not even get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we allowed ourselves to get down 3-0,'' Murray
said, ``that was the big story of the game. But when Garry Galley
followed Sloan's goal with one of his own just 23 seconds later to
make it 3-1, the Kings finally were on the boar d.
</P>
<P>
   A scoreless first period might have been considered a victory in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind 2-0 after one period in each of the
season's earlier games to Dallas a 3-2 overtime loss on Nov. 24 and
a 4-1 stin ker Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they do better than any team in the league,''
captain Rob Blake said. ``They know how to play with a lead and
keep you playing their game. Most times there isn't much you can
do. This time, the play was physical and the Stars, who lost
Wednesd ay night to the Mighty Ducks, appeared sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   But just over three minutes into the second period, the Kings
second problem with the Stars returned. The power play.
</P>
<P>
   Sean O'Donnell was in the midst of serving a penalty for a fight
with Grant Marshall that including whistles for instigating, a
fighting major and a 10-minute misconduct. Sydor, who was razzed by
the crowd all night, got the Star firs t goal when he tipped in a
blast from Morrow past Kings goaltender Jamie Storr.

CUBAN BOY'S GRANDMOTHERS HOPE TO FLY TO U.S. TO BRING HIM HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs byline and dateline; story subs completely for changes in
emphasis and updating) 
 (sw) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The Clinton administration issued visas on Thursday to
the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, a move that would
allow the two women to travel to the United States from Cuba and
that could set up a custody showdown on American soil between two
sets of the Cuban boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomatic mission in Havana granted the visas as a
delegation from the National Council of Churches, which has sought
the return of the boy to his father in Cuba, landed in Havana
Thursday night and met with the women.
</P>
<P>
   But the plans for the trip to the United States were uncertain
as the meeting ended early on Friday with both the Americans and
Cubans leaving with somber faces and saying the discussions would
resume later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue from an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 other people drowned fleeing Cuba, he has
been living with relatives in Miami. The boy's great-uncle in Miami
is seeking permanent custody.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal
grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, applied for the visas late Thursday
afternoon, and the visas were granted in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found to be eligible and the visas were quickly
granted,'' said James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State
Department. ``We understand they will travel tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintana has told the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that
she wanted to travel to Miami ``for just five minutes'' to pick up
her grandson. Ms. Rodriguez, whose daughter died trying to reach
the United States, has been equally emphatic that the youngster
should return to Cuba to live with his father. The boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has said repeatedly that he wants Elian to
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the National Council of Churches wanted to fly the two women
to New York instead of Miami to avoid a confrontation with
Cuban-American demonstrators in Florida who have demanded that the
boy remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the council did not return calls tonight for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reports here had suggested that the chartered jet that took the
church delegation to Havana Thursday night might be used to fly the
boy's grandmothers to the United States. But the plane left Cuba
shortly after it arrived, without the two women. It was unclear if
the jet would return to Havana today or if the church group would
find another way to fly them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers met for about an hour Thursday at the Cuban
Council of Churches with Bob Edgar, general secretary of the
National Council of Churches; Joan Brown Campbell, the former
general secretary; and Oscar Bolioli, the council's Latin American
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The women left the meeting just after midnight, silent and
somber faced. A few minutes later, the American council officials
left, reminding reporters gathered outside that the discussions
were very sensitive and would be resumed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, leaders of the group, which is based in New York,
traveled to Havana and met with the boy's father and relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Thursday night that they would
welcome a visit by the grandmothers because they assumed that it
would create sympathy for the position of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy be reunited
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Thursday night that
Rangel planned to meet with the two women in New York City on
Friday. Rangel will offer to help the women make their case that
the boy belongs in Cuba, said Emile Milne, a press secretary for
Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   Milne also said it was his understanding that the women intended
to take Elian back to Cuba. ``Their mission is to bring him back,''
he said. ``I don't think anyone can be certain that it will happen,
but that's their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Miami on Wednesday that challenged the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling on Jan. 4 that the
youngster belongs with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had considered going to court to ask
a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in an effort to
resolve quickly what has evolved into a highly emotional, extremely
difficult political and diplomatic quandary.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official denied that the grandmothers' visit
was intended to circumvent the legal process. ``Presumably,'' the
official said, ``the two grandmothers can speak better for the
father's interests than the boy's great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that the father did
not travel to the United States because he did not want to be drawn
into the court battle over custody.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that Justice
Department officials would move as quickly and as vigorously as
possible to resolve the matter in federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything that can be done to have the matter
heard appropriately and promptly, with the recognition that it does
the child no good to be in limbo,'' Reno said at her weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said repeatedly that the government's
decision that the boy should return to Cuba was not affected by
politics and had been made by midlevel officials who applied the
facts and the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials have acknowledged, however, that
Elian's custody has meaningful ramifications for United States-Cuba
relations and for relations between the administration and leaders
of the politically powerful Cuban-American community in Florida.
The case, they admit, has been discussed at the highest levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 14 people who tried to sail to the Florida coast
from Cuba in a 17-foot aluminum boat, which capsized. The boy's
mother and stepfather and nine others drowned. Elian, and two
others, were rescued after clinging to inner tubes in Florida
waters for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his fate has become the subject of an intense fight
between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Elian's great-uncle
argued that the immigration service had violated Elian's right of
due process. They asked a federal judge to prevent the agency from
returning the boy before it granted him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the great-uncle, Spencer Eig, told The Associated
Press that the lawsuit was filed to protect ``Elian's civil and
constitutional rights, the same as if he was any other child.''
</P>
<P>
   Eig told the Cable News Network Thursday night that the
grandmothers would be welcome to visit Elian in Miami but that they
would not be permitted to take the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers whose expertise is family and immigration law
support the position of the Clinton administration, saying the
reunification of a parent and child is a cornerstone of immigration
law and INS practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is rather clear on this,'' said Eliot Lichtman, a
veteran immigration lawyer. ``This is a federal issue for the
immigration service. They have interviewed the father and decided
the father has a loving relationship with the son.''
</P>
<P>
   At Juan Gonzalez's house in Cardenas, Cuba, early Thursday
evening, Gustavo Basulto, who described himself as a close friend
of the Gonzalez family, said he had not heard about the granting of
visas to the boy's grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grandmothers would like to go directly to the United
States to pick up Elian, but we don't know anything about any U.S.
visas,'' Basulto said in a brief telephone interview.

HACKER SET TO BE FREED AFTER 5 YEARS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Kevin Mitnick, a Los Angeles area
computer hacker set to be freed after five years in prison, insists
he was ``like James Bond behind the computer,'' not a digital
Dillinger trying to steal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself as an electronic joy rider,'' Mitnick said during
an interview with the ``60 Minutes'' television news show, his
first public comments since his arrest. ``I was like James Bond
behind the computer. I was just having a blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quite easy to become a millionaire. I could have
simply accessed the computers of law firms that do acquisitions and
mergers and traded on the information,'' the 36-year-old Monroe
High School graduate said during the interview, which will air
Sunday. ``I could have transferred funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities see Mitnick in a darker light. He was the first
computer hacker ever to make it onto the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
He was arrested in 1995 and pleaded guilty in March 1999 to five
counts of computer and wire fraud after he illegally entered some
of the world's most secure computers, at Sun Microsystems, Motorola
and San Diego-based Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a mere prankster,'' federal prosecutor Chris
Painter said. ``He caused millions in damages that caused these
companies to shut down their networks and make upgrades and
repairs. That's not a prankster.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter said Mitnick's copying of secret files and password
theft cost firms at least $10 million, and hundreds of millions
more in repairs, upgrades and corporate delays.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick will be freed Friday, Jan. 21. For three years, Mitnick
will be under supervised release and must stay away from computer
hardware and software, cell phones, computer networks, personal
information assistants and televisions that could be used for
online access.
</P>
<P>
   He is prohibited from working as a consultant to computer
companies or in any firms with access to computers, Painter said.
If he violates those terms, he could be rearrested and possibly
sent back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sentence was appropriate for his conduct,''
Painter said. ``I hope he has learned his lesson and can get on
with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The hacker's grandmother, Reba Vartanian, said she was elated he
will finally be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been over a long time ago,'' Vartanian said,
breaking into tears. ``I wanted to go to California to see him, but
I felt he and his mother needed that time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Vartanian has been asked not to speak about the case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's computer hacking exploits fueled Web sites, books and
an upcoming movie. He became a hero in the underground world of
computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly has maintained a ``Free
Kevin'' Web site since his capture. A posting on the site from the
Webmaster on Thursday said the hacking community will work to help
the freed icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is going to be extremely difficult for him,'' the posting
reads ``The terms of his supervised release ... make it virtually
impossible for Kevin to use his abilities in a constructive
manner.''

USC GETS A MAGICAL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If USC wants to believe its season is beginning to
get a magical feel, it can offer Thursday night's overtime victory
over Arizona State as first-hand proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans nearly ran out of bodies, with two of their top six
players injured and two starters saddled with four fouls. But
despite trailing near the end of regulation and in overtime, USC
made several spirited comebacks to defeat Arizona State 95-92
before 5,343 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hung in there. This is a great win for us,'' forward
David Bluthenthal said. ``We knew we had to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an understatement. USC (11-5, 4-0) plays Arizona (16-2,
5-0) at the Sports Arena on Saturday in a showdown for first place
in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 4-0 in conference for the first time since
1978-79.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a team that did not want to lose,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``Guys hung in there and guys came off the bench and
did well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was bigger than Bluthenthal, who tied a school record
with 28 rebounds, which was originally set by Cliff Robinson in
1978. It's the most rebounds by a player in the nation this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I could do that,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I never
even imagined it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bibby: ``I've been in the game a long time and I haven't
seen many guys control the game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans needed a huge game from Bluthenthal, because they
were hit hard by injuries. Forward Sam Clancy left the game with
12:48 left after landing hard on his right foot while scoring a
basket. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were already shorthanded because forward Jarvis
Turner was out after injuring his left ankle in the first half.
Turner was on crutches after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were scheduled to take X-rays late Thursday night.
Clancy said he thought he could return by Saturday, but Turner's
injury appeared far more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Without those players, the Trojans got some inspirational play
from guard Jeff Trepagnier and forward Brian Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   USC trailed in regulation 82-77 with 1:24 left. That's when
Trepagnier, who played his final 23 minutes with four fouls, made
three plays that turned the game around. He hit a 3-pointer with 57
seconds left to cut the lead to 82-80. He then blocked a wide-open
layup attempt by ASU's Justin Allen and tied the game on a tip-in
with 9.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (11-5, 3-2) had a chance to win the game, but Eddie House
missed a jump shot and forward Shawn Redhage missed a tip-in at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were faced with playing shorthanded in overtime, but
Scalabrine responded by scoring seven of USC's first eight points
in the extra period to give the Trojans a 91-89 lead with a minute
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fear we might lose and that's what triggered
that,'' Scalabrine said of his offensive burst. He tied a career
high with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   USC led 95-92 with 9.7 seconds left, giving the Sun Devils one
final chance to tie the game. House, who leads the Pac-10 in
scoring (24.4 points) drove downcourt and launched a 3-pointer that
bounced off the rim with two seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Bluthenthal grabbed the game's final rebound.
</P>
<P>
   House was held to 13 points and made just 5 of 21 shots. He did
not start because he missed a team flight from Phoenix to Los
Angeles on Wednesday and was held out the opening three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC has been informed by Kickoff Classic officials that
its chances of playing in the Aug. 27 football game at the
Meadowlands have improved significantly after Michigan favored the
Trojans over Virginia Tech as an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement could come as soon as today or by early
next week. Michigan is locked into the game and has influence over
who will be its opponent. It would be USC's second trip to the
Kickoff Classic in four years. The Trojans played Penn State in
1996.

LARRY RALLIES NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somebody needed to step forward for the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball team. Anybody.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be someone who was benched and then went out
and moped through a half. Then Andre Larry snapped out of his funk,
just in time to help end a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, a senior forward who didn't start for the first time in
seven games, scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half and CSUN
beat Montana State 73-63 on Thursday night in front of 1,029 at
Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal, he was phenomenal in the second half,'' said CSUN
coach Bobby Braswell of Larry's performance. ``I challenged him at
halftime. A lot of times, you can beat yourself, and that's what he
did in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry's surge included nine points in a 12-2 run that turned a
46-46 tie into a 58-46 Northridge lead. He had a pair of slam dunks
in the run; those are the 6-foot-9 forward's forte.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry also stepped out and hit a 3-pointer, the Matadors'
only 3 of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake over the weekend . . . I was late for a
practice,'' said Larry, who moved into the starting lineup on Dec.
28 against St. Francis. ``I learned my lesson.... In the first
half, I just wasn't aggressive. I was standing around, looking
around.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which improved to 3-2 in the Big Sky Conference and 11-5
overall,needed Larry. The Bobcats (10-7, 2-2) weren't buckling, and
they were gaining confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the hammer. Larry scored 11 of CSUN's 13 points in one
stretch, and he also led a charge on the glass. Northridge,
outrebounded 23-13 in the first half, reversed that stat in the
second half and edged the shorter, slower Bobcats by one (37-36)
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little vocal at halftime,'' Braswell said. ``There's
no way you're going to win in the conference when you're getting
outrebounded like that (in the first half). We did a much better
job in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most crucial rebound came from 6-foot-1 guard Carl
Holmes, who grabbed the ball after a missed free throw by CSUN to
keep alive a possession with fewer than two minutes left. Montana
State had crept to within 68-61 before Holmes' hustling play and
never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the toughest team to play (in the Big Sky) on
its homecourt,'' said MSU forward Justin Brown, who had a team-high
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   What made it tougher for the Bobcats was CSUN's sense of
revenge. Montana State eliminated Northridge from the Big Sky
Tournament last year, coming from 21 points down to take a
thrilling 91-90 win. Guard Jeff Riggs hit the winning shot for MSU
last year, and he was back Thursday, scoring 14 and adding four
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come into my mind that much,'' Riggs said.
</P>
<P>
   It did with the Matadors, Larry especially. He missed an
off-balance 30-footer at the buzzer after Riggs' shot last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on a mission,'' Larry said. ``We had to get back
at Montana State. They've knocked us out of the tournament a few
times. (Revenge) is the only thing I was looking forward to.''

DOMAIN NAMES COULD BE WORTH 7 FIGURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- What's in a name? More than a million
bucks, if you've got the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Internet address auctioneer GreatDomains.com has four it
believes are worth seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   They include Year2000.com, which was put up for sale on the
auction site eBay for $10 million but the winning bid turned out to
be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining three -- Loans.com, Cinema.com and Taxes.com --
are being sold in a joint auction that will close Jan. 28, said
Jeff Tinsley, chief executive officer of GreatDomains.com.
</P>
<P>
   The auction is being billed as the highest aggregate value sale
to date of domain names, the electronic addresses to Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be big. We have a verified offer for loans of
$1.3 million and offers of over $1 million for taxes and cinema,''
Tinsley said. ``We've actually received offers in excess of $3
million for loans.com that are in the process of verification.''
</P>
<P>
   The verified bids for taxes and cinema stand at $250,000 each as
of Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley values the loans.com domain name at or near the price
for which his company sold business.com: $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the larger bidders are holding back until
the end of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always happens that way,'' Tinsley said. ``We're not
surprised at all at the offers we've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying six- and seven-figure prices for the right to use a name
is increasingly common, said Clay Ryder, vice president and chief
analyst for Zona Research, a Redwood City, Calif.-based Internet
Research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price paid is either absurd or it's not -- depending on
your point of view,'' Ryder said. ``What they spend advertising
them far outstrips the amount of money they pay for the name.''
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains.com has a strict verification process to protect
sellers as well as buyers who are putting up those huge sums of
money, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's account executives receive the bids, then calls
the company or person who submitted them.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains.com also requires some sort of financial
verification as well, Tinsley said. It can be in the form of a bank
statement showing that the bidder in fact has the money or it can
be a letter of credit from the bidder's bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to show us the money. We're not going to take any
offers that aren't verified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That policy is designed to prevent exactly what happened to
Canadian computer consultant Peter DeJager and his partner Tenagra
Corp. of Houston. The partners auctioned their domain name,
year2000.com, on eBay, but the winning bid and the second-highest
bid both were fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A bid verification policy such as the one GreatDomains.com has
would prevent that problem, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay takes a much less active role in managing the transactions
on its site than does GreatDomains.com, said Kevin Pursglove, eBay
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the Internet to allow individuals to conduct their own
business,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   He said eBay offers bid verification service through outside
contractors at an extra charge, in much the same way eBay offers
escrow service.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder said sellers who are unfamiliar with the ways of the
Internet set themselves up for just such a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are uneducated in the market in which they're
playing are going to lay peril to those who victimize,'' Ryder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said the vast majority of eBay customers -- buyers and
sellers -- conduct their transactions with no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 90 percent of the transactions that take place on
eBay satisfy the buyer and the seller,'' Pursglove said. ``Here's
an example where we had a problem and we had a customer who is not
satisfied. We hope to learn from it and if necessary we will have
new policies in place to deal with it.''

UCLA NO MATCH FOR ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for that Carolina high, so much for midseason
momentum,and so much for the Pac-10 title. Three weeks into the
conference season, UCLA's chance for the ring has become a wistful
thing.
</P>
<P>
   With four days to prepare, No. 2 Arizona shut down UCLA's
offense, carved up its defense and took control of the Pac-10 race
with a dominating 76-61 victory Thursday night in front of 12,202
at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (10-5, 1-3), losers of three of their last four,
contributed to their own demise with horrendous ballhandling. They
had a season-high 26 turnovers, including 18 in the second half.
They threw bad passes on the fast break and bad passes in the
half-court offense. They dribbled the ball off their feet and
passed it off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they played like it was a pickup game in the Men's
Gym,and that won't work against teams as sound as Arizona, which,
despite starting three freshmen, took the lead two minutes into the
game and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnovers can be credited to their quickness, good
defense, a good job getting in the passing lanes and our inability
to be fundamentally sound,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``Our
problem is the same: We play inconsistently, well sometimes, poor
others. Tonight, we played poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso was superb (22 points and 14 rebounds), but
he had no help. The Bruins were 3 of 21 from 3-point range. Point
guard Earl Watson and center Dan Gadzuric were ineffective, the
bench did nothing, and UCLA's best player, freshman forward Jason
Kapono, had 10 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst game I've played in my life,'' said
Kapono,who tweaked his knee in practice Wednesday but did not
attribute his performance to the injury. ``I came out cold and it
got to my head. The turnovers, the bad plays, the breakdowns that's
what caused us to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss not only snuffed the Bruins' Pac-10 title hopes, it
slowed their progress towards 18 victories, which, based on
precedent, should get them an NCAA Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, every Pac-10 team with at least 18 wins
and a .500-or-better conference record has received an at-large bid
(14of 14). The only way the Bruins get to 18 victories without a
.500 conference record is if they win at No.6 Syracuse, and that in
itself would do wonders for their power rating.
</P>
<P>
   To reach 18, however, they'll need to take care of the ball and
vanquish the inconsistency that has plagued them since the schedule
stiffened in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the story of our season: We get a win and things look
bright, but then they get dim again,'' Kapono said. ``We get better
one game, and then it gets worse. We go hot-cold, hot-cold, instead
of staying hot.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's troubles didn't end with turnovers. It played
undisciplined defense, committed 23 fouls and watched Arizona make
19 of 29 free throws. Meanwhile, the Wildcats, who have seven
scholarship players and cannot afford foul trouble, played sound
defense and held UCLA to four free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any great secrets, and they'll see that on the
film,'' said Arizona assistant Jim Rosborough, who designed the
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play good defense on the perimeter and not give
(the guards) any good looks. We knew which shoulder Moiso likes to
go over, and when he went over his right, he killed us. We told
(point guard Jason) Gardner to be alert and not give Watson any
good looks, and we did a nice job on Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we thought they'd try the zone, since they did
such a good job of it against North Carolina. We tried to get it to
(center Loren) Woods high and have him dump it to (forward) Michael
Wright, and he hurt them (22 points). Otherwise, it was nothing
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's attack was well-balanced. Gardner had 20 points, Woods
had 14 and Gilbert Arenas, the Grant High product, overcame
first-half foul trouble to score 15 points in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always seen UCLA on TV, and I wished I could play there
one day,'' said Arenas, who was lightly recruited by the Bruins.
``I was very nervous. That's why I had foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenas found his rhythm just as UCLA committed three consecutive
turnovers early in the second half. The Wildcats snatched the
opportunity, scored seven consecutive points and took a 39-32 lead.
Their lead was 13 when UCLA made its final surge. Kapono drained
two 3-pointers, then Billy Knight's three-point play pulled the
Bruins within 63-57 with four minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   They got no closer.

 SEN. BRADLEY TAKES HIS TURN WOOING SENIOR CITIZENS IN IOWA  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The greatest hits of Frankie, Sammy and Dean,
``The Rat Pack,'' blared in the old Val Air Ballroom, as Democratic
candidate Bill Bradley took his place under the glittering mirror
ball and not far from the autographed photos of Fabian and Glenn
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   On the great wooden dance floor sat 200 attentive members of the
American Association of Retired Persons. Many of them recalled
jitter-bugging the night away to the great prewar big bands here
six decades ago. Now, they had come _ some with walkers, some with
canes, others jogging in from the bitter cold _ to hear a man who
wants to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And they wanted answers on the issue many said matters most in
the 2000 presidential election _ health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent $3,000 last year on prescriptions, and I'm a retired
pharmacist,'' said Donald Winston, a 77-year-old AARP activist,
standing before a table of coffee and plate-sized cookies to
welcome seniors into the forum.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 90 minutes Thursday, the former New Jersey senator
and Democratic presidential hopeful joked with the audience,
seriously addressed their concerns, posed for pictures, answered
their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he was asked, did he deserve their vote?
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to being willing to tackle big problems with a
big solution ... and an example of that is health care,'' he told
the crowd. Bradley argued that his sweeping $65 billion plan would
provide ``quality affordable health care for everyone,'' while Vice
President Al Gore ``proposes taking the existing system and
nibbling around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   With just four days left before the crucial Iowa caucuses,
Bradley is the latest presidential candidate to underscore one of
the most potent political realities of the race: that when the
seniors of Iowa talk, candidates listen.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being relegated to an afterthought, senior citizens in
Iowa, where the cost of living is among the lowest in the nation,
represent a crucial and highly influential vote in this contest.
Politically astute and issues-oriented, they comprise 15 percent of
the state's voters, and they have been assiduously courted by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Fosket, a retired insurance agent from Des Moines, said
she came to Bradley's event this week because of his campaign's
insistence _ ``they're organized, better than Gore'' _ but she was
far from decided, or even predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning towards Forbes, too,'' she said, munching on a
cookie. ``He's not like the rest of them. No one's got a hand in
his pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosket, one of the nonpartisan AARP's 350,000 members in Iowa,
takes her politics seriously _ and so does her organization. The
signs plastered to walls and podiums at their political forums say
it all: ``Democracy is Ageless.''
</P>
<P>
   And time and again, as they gathered in the slightly ramshackle
ballroom, the seniors who turned out to see Bradley _ Democrats,
Republicans and independents _ said they expect the next president
to take health care seriously, not just for them, but for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   While he applauded Bradley's emphasis on health care as a
cornerstone of his campaign, Winston _ one of a generation that
clearly remembers times of economic uncertainty _ was also openly
skeptical of the candidate's plan to provide health care for every
child in American.
</P>
<P>
   ``What scares me most in health care is that these candidates
are getting carried away. ... To say you'll cover everyone _ how do
you do that?'' Winston asked.
</P>
<P>
   So throughout the frozen turf of Iowa this week, Bradley _ like
the rest of the presidential pack _ is left the mighty task of
trying to win them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, but I met him and I trust him,'' said
Margaret Rees, a retired auditor from Des Moines who sat in the
second row at Bradley's talk Thursday. ``But I'm still not
decided.''

CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS FINALLY MAKE PLAN TO GET ON WEB
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ California is aggressively moving toward
establishing an interactive presence on the Web, years after
businesses jumped on the new communications medium as another way
to reach out to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Although state bureaucracies maintain Web pages, government
officials are now discussing ways to establish interactive
transactions ranging from enrolling children in school to updating
addresses on driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do I believe that we will be voting from home and
educating people on the Internet, but 10 years from now, the
Internet will rival TV and radio,'' Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday.
``It will change the way we act as a society and franchise more
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the e-government efforts say it will not only be a
way to encourage more participation by citizens but will improve
the image of government as an easy-to-access service provider.
</P>
<P>
   But hanging over these efforts is the  &LR; concern over what's being
called the so-called &LR; ``digital divide,'' the gap between people who
have computer access and knowledge and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state has had several expensive computer
project failures in the past few years that have weakened its
integrity on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, however, the state's top Democrat and
its highest-ranking Republican have both highlighted potential
e-government roles, including: online voting, public access to
campaign finance reports on the Internet and online motor vehicle
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's top Republican and a
potentialpossible &LR;  gubernatorial candidate, unveiled a
comprehensive e-government  &LR; plan at the end of the year that would
have 90 percent of California's state services online at a single
Internet location by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians should actually be able to be online and not in
line waiting for government services,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also proposed elevating the Department of Information
Technology to a Cabinet-level position and offering scholarships to
recruit trained high-tech staff.
</P>
<P>
   To help close the digital divide, Jones proposed scholarships
and tax incentives for companies to provide computers and Internet
access to low-income households.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposals have been far more moderate. A new e-mail
address was the highlight during the State of the State speech. His
proposed budget includes $2.1 million for the one-stop Internet
site envisioned by Jones, with an additional $90 million over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his education plan, Davis does propose spending $364
million to have every high school hooked up to the Net by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   During a teleconference with the Brookings Institute in
Washington, D.C., Thursday, Davis said he expects people to be
voting online in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that within the next five to seven years, you
will be able to cast a ballot on the Internet just as easily as you
can buy a stock today,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Jones' task force on Internet voting unveiled
an incremental four-step approach that will slowly test the online
systems for security.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he endorses a cautious, incremental approach like the
one proposed by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Jones unveiled the state's system for electronically
filing candidate and initiative campaign contribution reports.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, contribution reports are paper documents stored at
Jones' office, limiting public access.
</P>
<P>
   The system was created by legislation two years ago and becomes
operational Sunday when candidates who raised $100,000 or more
during 1999 must begin submitting reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic reports, however, show only how much money
candidates have raised from Jan. 1 through Jan. 21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have grumbled that Jones has been slow to approve
companies to file the electronic documents. With only 48 hours
before filing begins, Jones has approved only four companies to
process the forms &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Although the state's investment of $384 million made state
government's passage into the millennium glitch-free, California's
past computer woes have been expensive and extensive.
</P>
<P>
   After learning in 1990 that a new computer system at the
Department of Motor vehicles would take longer to process
information than the one already in use, the state waited four
years before killing the plan, which cost taxpayers $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after spending $111 million, the state canceled its
contract with Lockheedcq &LR;  Martin Information Management Systems to
build and operate a statewide child support database.
</P>
<P>
   The state is trying to create a new system but, in the meantime,
is paying $100 million in annual fines to the federal government,
which ordered the computer database.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the State Automated Welfare System, the most
expensive computer project ever undertaken by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Envisioned as a statewide way to track welfare recipients, the
system's price tag in January 1993 was estimated at $711 million
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   By December of  &LR; 1993, the price had risen to $800 million over
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise of a statewide system has now been abandoned.
Instead, the state and federal government are bankrolling four
systems, parceling out the state's 58 counties among them.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has earmarked more than $93 million in state and federal
money for maintenance of the four tracking systems.

ANCIENT ROCKS TELL OF WHEN PLANET TILTED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The chaotic churning of Earth's molten heart has produced strange
wanderings of our planet's magnetic North Pole over countless
millions of years, but now it seems that the whole globe itself may
have tilted dramatically back in the days of the dinosaurs.
<P>
   If scientists measuring magnetism in rocks long buried beneath
the Pacific Ocean are correct, then the spinning Earth was
unexpectedly rolling like a basketball some 84 million years ago,
and tilted as much as 16 to 21 degrees in only about 2 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   That's sudden on the scale of geologic time. And if it happened
today, San Francisco would find itself luxuriating in the tropical
warmth of Baja California, while Washington, D.C., would be located
far south  &LR; in the Caribbean, about where Cuba is today.
</P>
<P>
   Two scientists report today that the abrupt change in the
balance of the planet most likely was caused by vast chunks of the
Earth's crust diving deeply into the viscous mantle that lies
beneath.
</P>
<P>
   William W. Sager, a specialist in the Earth's ancient magnetic
field, and Anthony A.P. Koppers, a planetary physicist at the
Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, are reporting on
their insights into the behavior of the  &LR; ancient Earth today in the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Although their theory is controversial, it does support an idea
proposed less than three years ago by a team of geologists at the
California Institute of Technology. They found evidence that even
farther back in time _ some half a billion years ago or so _ a
dramatic shifting of the Earth's crust tilted the entire globe a
full 90 degrees within a swift span of only 15 million years.
</P>
<P>
   That team, headed by Joseph L. Kirschvink, proposed that the
shift must have carried the farthest northern latitudes all the way
to the equatorial regions and thereby touched off the great
``Cambrian explosion'' of multicellular life _ a period that saw
all the major groupings of plants and animals begin their slow
evolutionary march.
</P>
<P>
   Sager and Koppers make no such extravagant claims for their new
scenario for polar wandering, but they do say that their magnetic
evidence from 27 long-vanished undersea volcanoes in the Pacific
Ocean is persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that the Earth's magnetic north and
south poles are never fixed, and that they tend to wander from
point to point around the axis of the planet's spinning rotation.
Because tiny particles of basalt _ the solidified lava erupted from
volcanoes _ carry the imprint of the polar magnetism from the time
the lava cooled, scientists can accurately determine just where the
magnetic poles were millions upon millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was this knowledge, gained from studies less than 50 years
ago, that led to the theory that the Earth's great slabs of crust
have long been in ponderous motion. Those processes are known as
plate tectonics and continental drift. They are revealed even now
by the northward motion of the Indian subcontinent, driven by the
Australian plate which is steadily crunching the Himalayan mountain
range, including Everest, ever higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the report by Sager and Koppers, John Tarduno of
the University of Rochester in New York told Science that
``virtually every test we've done in the past five years suggests
that true polar wander has been overestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sager and Koppers are convinced by their data. ``What most
probably happened,'' Sager said in an interview Thursday, ``is that
huge cold slabs of the crust dove  &LR; dived down into the mantle
beneath, causing a major reorganization of the continents some 84
million years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That all happened within about 2 million years, Sager said, more
than 10 times faster than the time the normal process of
continental drift takes to move the crust.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``cold slabs'' would be nearly 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit
cooler than the 6,000-degree temperature that is believed to
prevail in the upper part of the viscous, semi-molten rock mantle
that underlies the Earth's crust. And the sudden downward dive of
such massive quantities of crustal rock would be more than enough
to cause the globe to tilt dramatically, Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That episode 84 million years ago was quite spectacular,''
Koppers added in an interview. ``In only 2 million years it moved
the Earth as much as normally might occur in 200 million years, or
even longer.''

BUSH SAYS MCCAIN TAX PLAN WOULD HURT ONLINE FIRMS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backed by several Silicon Valley executives, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's campaign charged Thursday that GOP
presidential rival John McCain's tax plan would cost online
companies such as Yahoo and eBay millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Internet taxes have become a flash point in the Republican
contest, with McCain challenging Bush to join him in endorsing a
permanent ban on Internet taxes. Bush has refused, saying he favors
extending the current three-year moratorium to five years, but
wants leeway after that.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Bush campaign charged that it is McCain who is
proposing a big tax hike on Internet commerce by requiring
companies to stretch out their deduction for advertising expenses
over five years, rather than writing them off immediately as
current law allows.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain proposal, which would affect all companies, would
allow 80 percent of advertising costs to be deducted in the current
year, but require the remainder to be spread out over the next
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very bad idea,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner
with the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins,
Caufield &AMP; Byers, in a press conference-call set up by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the first substantial tax increase for the
Internet,'' Kvamme said, arguing that McCain's plan would ``add
millions'' to the tax bills of Internet companies in particular
because they tend to be young companies that spend heavily on
advertising to build customer recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme estimated that McCain's provision could raise taxes on
Internet portal Yahoo! &LR;  by 13 percent, online auctioneer eBay by 19
percent, and online stock broker Ameritrade by 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign retorted that it would simply close a
``corporate loophole,'' and accused Bush of ``caving in to the
demands of special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has decided yet again to fight for the interests
of the special interests and lobbyists over the need for tax relief
for working Americans,'' the McCain campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain proposal closely resembles a 1997 suggestion by the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which estimated that it
would raise $28 billion in taxes over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign maintained that the provision ``will in no
way adversely effect (sic) the e-commerce revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision merely applies ``the same principle to advertising
costs as is applied to other business expenses that provide a
corporate benefit of more than one year,'' the campaign said.

PORN VENUE FORCED TO PLAY MOZART
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Now playing at the New Meat Campus Theater,
along with ``While the Sugar Daddy's Away'' and ``Amateur Strip
Night'' _ Mozart.
<P>
   They were having a problem at the New Meat on Jones, your
one-stop shop for gay live strip 'n' porn vid. Homeless folks were
sleeping in the theater's front alcove. And doing a lot of other
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The theater's owner, Terrance Alan, told the Police Commission
at Wednesday night's neighborhood session in the Tenderloin that
he'd found a way to chase the homeless out of the alcove.
</P>
<P>
   He installed a speaker and piped in Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's true: Music has charms to shoo a shabby pest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO FIND the money to build a new bridge?
</P>
<P>
   On the old bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back the pedestrian toll on the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   My historical consultant, Fenwick Footnote, notes that when the
GGB opened in '37, walkers paid a five-cent toll. Each way.
</P>
<P>
   The car toll was 50 cents, plus a nickel for each passenger over
the limit of four. If your car had to be towed off the bridge, they
hit you up for $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   That was so long ago that the official opening-day program was
headlined, ``There's No Delay the Gate Bridge Way; No Waits, No
Inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   So bring back the nickel walking toll. Jumpers would be
encouraged to empty their pockets at the toll both, since they
won't be needing their currency in the sea current.
</P>
<P>
   SCOOP CITY: J.P. (Just Plain) Strange checks in with a biggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the stir over the revelation of the other parent of
Melissa Etheridge's baby, Dame Edna Everage proudly confided to me
that her artistic son Kenny actually designed David Crosby's
maternity clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ROOM SERVICE? Send up some electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant Clift Hotel blacked out Tuesday night just after 11.
In the Redwood Room, piano man Michael Whiteley had just finished
his last set but sat back down in the dark to play ``Dancing in the
Dark,'' ``When Lights Are Low,'' and ``Piano in the Dark'' for the
martini-by-candlelight customers, and his tip jar ranneth over.
</P>
<P>
   Then Michael pitched in to help escort guests to and from their
rooms by flashlight. When he returned to the bar to pack up, his
tip jar was empty.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't bother to play ``I'm Busted,'' ``Money (That's
What I Want)'' or ``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime.''
</P>
<P>
   KICKING RONALD'S BUNS: In Strawberry, the little burg between
Tiburon and Marin City, John Konstin took his son for french fries
at McDonald's, then for a burger at the new In-N-Out a block away.
</P>
<P>
   At McDonald's: Three customers.
</P>
<P>
   At In-N-Out: They were calling customer order No. 20 and Konstin
was No. 72. He counted 22 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that one place is a fast-food joint, the other
is a hamburger shrine. One has customers, the other has devotees
and true believers.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost mystical. In-N-Out packs 'em in despite this: No
toys!
</P>
<P>
   SEAL ROCK ain't rockin' with seals. Nor with sea lions, which is
the animal that used to hang out there.
</P>
<P>
   It's been lonely on the rock since the sea lions left 10 years
ago for the cozier confines of the docks at Pier 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should rename it Bird S_ Rock,'' says John
Ringelmann, who hikes the S.F. headlands and misses the barking and
bickering of the lovable rock potatoes. ``That's all there is now
to look at _ rocks covered in white.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the sea lions left _ the place is a dump.
</P>
<P>
   At the Seal Rock Inn, overlooking Bird S_ Rock, the day man
confirmed that the rock is indeed sea lionless. But as far as he
knows, no guest has ever complained.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ROCKER mouths off about gays, Asian women and all
immigrants, and baseball commissioner Bud Selig sends him to a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough, says superfan Homer Fungo. ``Trade Selig to Cuba for
Fidel Castro. Baseball needs someone who respects the game and will
protect its honor.''
</P>
<P>
   My question: If Rocker gets slapped for his insensitivity to
other races and cultures, why doesn't Selig order 1 million Atlanta
Braves fans to the psychiatrist to be treated for their Native
American-bashing ``Tomahawk Chop''?
</P>
<P>
   CALTRANS dedicated the Robert Halligan Museum in Oakland
Thursday, and you're probably thinking, ``Wake me when they get the
Evolution of the Fluorescent Traffic Cone exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how interesting the museum is, but give the late
Bob Halligan a tip o' the hat for what he did for you. Halligan,
who died a year ago, was a Caltrans engineer with a bit of P.T.
Barnum in his soul.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Caltrans to paint the rainbow over the Waldo Tunnel
on 101 north of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   And in '86, Halligan strung five miles of 40-watt bulbs along
the cables of the Bay Bridge, then helped hustle up the money to
make the dramatic ``string of pearls'' a permanent nighttime
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   IF REGIS should ask you, ``What's the water polo equivalent of
the Heisman Trophy?'' here's what you tell him:
</P>
<P>
   The Peter J. Cutino Award. The Olympic Club of S.F. created the
award and will give out the first one Saturday night. Actually, the
first  &UR; two.  &LR; The honorees will be Sean Kern of UCLA and Bernice
Orwig of USC.
</P>
<P>
   The award, named for Cal's (and the Olympic Club's) 17-time
national coach of the year, will be presented by Peter Ueberroth.
Pete played polo at S.J. State, and in '84, he headed up the Los
Angeles Olympics and was credited with saving the entire Olympics
movement from financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Psst, Pete! Wanna buy and revive a local pro football team?

CLINTON PLAN TO WIRE THE HAVE-NOTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sweeping initiative to bridge the ``digital divide,'' the
Clinton administration plans to provide personal computers and
Internet access to millions of low-income families across the
nation, The Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The program _ tentatively titled ``ClickStart'' _ calls for the
federal government to provide as much as $100 million in subsidies
to help as many as 9 million households go online, according to
interviews with leading Silicon Valley executives and government
sources involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where every day people are slipping through
the cracks,'' said Nick Grouf, chief executive of PeoplePC, a San
Francisco-based provider of low-cost computer systems and one of
the original proponents of the ClickStart plan. ``That's a
frightening situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Grouf compared the ClickStart  &LR; program to the Rural
Electrification Administration, which was formed by President
Franklin Roosevelt in 1935 to extend electrical power and telephone
service to thousands of the nation's farms and remote communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is taking the root of that plan and applying
it to a very similar technology,'' Grouf said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to make the widening gap between the
technology haves and have-nots a key point of his State of the
Union speech next week, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has repeatedly emphasized that closing the
digital divide is a White House spokesman Patrick Dorton said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With just a year left in the Clinton administration, the
initiative could serve to underscore Clinton's legacy as the first
tech-savvy president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, in a widely
publicized event called Net Day, inaugurated the first government
campaign to extend the information superhighway to millions of
Americans. Both came to Concord and literally laid the wires to
promote Internet access in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 40 percent of American families have computers, but only
8 percent of households earning less than $10,000 a year have PCs,
and just 3 percent of that group have access to the Internet,
according to the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Gore campaign officials declined to comment
specifically on the ClickStart initiative _ which gets its name
from the successful HeadStart program for disadvantaged children _
but prominent Silicon Valley executives confirmed that the plan is
quickly moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has strong support within the White House,'' said Wade
Randlett, vice president of Red Gorilla, a San Francisco Internet
startup, and a longtime adviser to Gore on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   There are other programs intended to make the Net more
accessible to kids and low-income people. But these efforts have
focused mostly on wiring schools and public libraries, whereas
ClickStart would bridge the digital divide by running the
information superhighway directly into people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of the initiative will begin in Oakland, where
the Marcus A. Foster Educational Institute will place
Internet-ready PCs in about 500 homes. Computer training for
participating households is slated to begin this weekend, and
distribution of PCs will follow within days.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot program goes smoothly, the Clinton administration
is expected to push for funding to expand the program nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every household you get wired can be done for a few hundred
dollars in capital and a monthly co-pay,'' said Eric Schmidt, chief
executive of software developer Novell and another prime mover
behind the ClickStart project.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Henderson, executive director of the Marcus Foster
Institute, said families in the trial program must have an annual
income of no more than $25,000 and must have children in the
Oakland school system.
</P>
<P>
   She said parents will be required to undergo computer training
and will also have to commit to an unspecified number of ``service
hours'' working in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Participating families will pay between $5 and $10 a month for a
computer and unlimited Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to pay the money, they probably wouldn't
want to use the equipment,'' said Charles Katz, chief executive of
San Francisco's 1stUp.com, a provider of free, ad-supported
Internet access, and another proponent of ClickStart.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ClickStart was first raised in October at a
fund-raising dinner held for Clinton at Schmidt's Peninsula home.
The president was chatting with a group of Silicon Valley business
leaders about the challenge of bringing the benefits of digital
technology to a broader spectrum of people.
</P>
<P>
   As they discussed the details of such a scheme, Clinton grew
increasingly excited. ``He said, `Give me a proposal on that,' ''
Schmidt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalist Garrett Gruener of San Francisco's Alta
Partners put together a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was presented to White House officials last month.
According to sources, senior administration figures said they were
eager to push the program along as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The State of the Union speech, it was agreed, would make a
suitably high-profile occasion to highlight the digital-divide
issue and lay the groundwork for introducing ClickStart.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and other private-sector proponents of ClickStart noted
that the program should not be construed as an act of altruism on
the part of Silicon Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   While the primary motivation for the program is promoting
universal Internet access, Katz readily admitted that the company
is interested in future financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how 1stUp would enter into something that wouldn't
be profitable somewhere down the road,'' he said. ``Companies don't
give things away for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Novell's Schmidt echoed this sentiment. ``We benefit if we have
more customers,'' he said. ``You can argue that this is
self-serving, but our feeling is that while this is good for us,
it's also good for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider this a Democrat-versus-Republican issue,''
he said. ``It just happens to be coming through the president, who
happens to be a Democrat.''

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As part of the celebration of the Roman Catholic Holy Year 2000,
Pope John Paul II recently was joined by an Orthodox metropolitan
and an Anglican archbishop as he pushed open the Holy Door of St.
Paul Outside the Walls Basilica in Rome. Official representatives
from 22 Christian denominations participated in the service.
 &HT;    The Vatican described the ceremony as ``the most significant
ecumenical event'' of this Holy Year. Seemingly overjoyed with its
success, the pope spoke of the need to ``repent'' for the divisions
within Christianity. ``Unity, unity, maybe even we, leaving this
basilica, can say unity.''
 &HT;    Although Christianity enjoyed great success in the last
millennium, it can not be credited with much success in pursuing
unity. Christian unity began unraveling in 1054 -- Orthodox and
Roman Catholic Christians excommunicated one another during a
quarrel over a creed. Five hundred years later, Roman Catholic
unity dissolved under the weight of the Protestant Reformation.
 &HT;    The splits continued -- scholars estimate there are now some
22,000 separate Christian denominations.
 &HT;    The word ``ecumenical'' is derived from a Greek term meaning
``the whole inhabited earth.'' Since 1900, it has referred to a
movement to reunite Christianity. The impulse behind it comes from
Jesus' own prayer, ``That all might be one, even as Thou, Father,
and I are One.''
 &HT;    In the last century, Christians formed a host of ecumenical
organizations. And the quest to reunite Christendom continues at a
high denominational level today.
 &HT;    While a lovely idea in principle, however, few Christian
movements have been as wrong-headed as contemporary ecumenism.
 &HT;    Yes, it is moving to see the pope praying with Orthodox,
Anglican and Protestant leaders. Many of us are sincerely grateful
that Rome no longer hurls anathemas consigning non-Catholics to
eternal damnation. We are equally thankful that Protestants no
longer consider Roman Catholics dupes of Satan. The Orthodox have
joined in as well -- being willing to talk to both of us.
 &HT;    Ecumenism has given Protestants the right to take communion from
one another and allow ministers to preach in churches other than
their own. It has recognized the common Christian bond of baptism
regardless of denomination. And it has given us a host of
interdenominational Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter services.
 &HT;    Whatever the gains, however, a host of knotty theological
problems remain, including the sad fact that Protestant, Catholic
and Orthodox Christians can not partake Holy Communion together.
 &HT;    But the real problem with the ecumenical movement is that most
lay persons -- liberal or conservative -- do not want any kind of
institutional reunion of Christianity. Professional ecumenism, and
that is what it has become over the last half century, is probably
even a less popular idea with rank-and-file Christians than
homosexual ordination.
 &HT;    While learned theologians toil at unwanted reunion schemes,
those of us who occupy the pews have opted for our own kind of
street-level ecumenism. We regularly ignore official ecumenical
pronouncements. Instead, we share our lives in small groups and
prayer meetings, take care of the poor in soup kitchens and
homeless shelters, and work for justice through political causes
and volunteer organizations.
 &HT;    We attend one another's schools and colleges; we read books
written by one another's ministers. We attend retreats and
workshops together. We borrow prayers, liturgies and music from
each other. Sometimes, we even break the rules and take communion
together. But we do not want one institutional church.
 &HT;    We like diversity. What Pentecostal wants to worship from the
Anglican Book of Common Prayer? What Catholic wants to sit through
hour-long Baptist sermons? What Orthodox Christian wants to give up
weekly communion in favor of charismatic praise choruses? Maybe
occasionally, but not on a regular basis.
 &HT;    There exists among the laity a common-sense ecumenism. We do not
want to be divided by theological technicalities, but we do enjoy,
appreciate, and even treasure Christian diversity. The myriad
expressions of Christian worship -- and even theological
perspectives -- reflect God's complexity.
 &HT;    Disunity is not necessarily a sin; it witnesses to human
creativity and imagination regarding divine and spiritual
mysteries. When Jesus prayed for Christian unity, he was not
praying for a worldwide megachurch. Jesus wanted Christians to be
one in love, prayer and service.
 &HT;    That unity can best be achieved through relationships and not
institutions, and would preserve the dignity and distinctiveness of
the practices cherished by God's people.
 &HT;    So what if institutional Christianity suffers disunity? Real
faith is always messy. Perhaps even God would find unified
Christendom boring.
 &HT;    The ecumenical movement is a dinosaur, a relic of the
twentieth-century ``organization man.'' It is time to fold up the
professional ecumenical shop and go home.
 &HT;    God's spirit blows where she will. And she's not blowing in
Geneva, Rome, or New York. She's blowing through the pews.

<P>
   ``It's often hard to find something fashionable to wear when
you're disabled,'' says Kurt Rieback, co-owner of Professional Fit
Clothing in Burbank, Calif. ``We cater to people with physical
challenges. The goal is to give customers a chance to enjoy more
dignity and confidence in their dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and his partner, Tom Pirruccello, join a growing cadre of
entrepreneurs across the country tuning into the needs of 54
million Americans who have difficulty buy clothing off the rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about dignity,'' says Tom. ``Stylish clothes help build
self esteem, and pave the way for smoother social interactions.
</P>
<P>
   CHOICES BUILD SELF IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   As Christopher Flynn, a quadriplegic for 10 years explains,
``Wearing jeans instead of sweats is a personal choice, and that's
what people with disabilities really want. If I go to a nice event,
I don't want to wear sweats and Ug boots. I'd like to wear jeans
just like anyone else, or dress pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and Tom had clothes modified for Christopher, including
several pairs of jeans. A larger zipper and an elastic waistband
allow easier dressing, and a longer inseam means more comfort while
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just makes me feel better in the morning,'' says
Christopher. ``Because when I get up, I realize that I'm not going
to wear the same old clothes, you know, sweat pants again. The new
clothes give me options, and that's a huge difference in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple alterations like placing Velcro tabs on shirts while
still keeping the buttons on the outside help create a more natural
look. Small openings strategically placed in pants or shirts to
accommodate feeding tubes and drainage bags improves the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was the administrator of a home for people with
developmental disabilities,'' explains Tom, ``I didn't like seeing
clients going around in muumuus, sweats, and shapeless garments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some had a tendency to wear polyester clothes that didn't
match. Maybe the inseams of the pants would be off, maybe higher,
maybe lower. And that's really uncomfortable. Plus, how do you
think people feel in ill-fitting, boring clothes day after day?
It's demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUSING ON ABILITIES
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously being in a wheelchair makes me different,'' says
Christopher. ``But I can try to fit in with everyone else by being
able to wear similar clothes, and by going to the same places. Then
I don't focus on the fact that I have limitations. I feel like I
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   A polar fleece jacket with a Velcro closure in the back made
Christopher's life easier, for example. ``From the front, it looks
like any other jacket,'' he says. ``But it's designed with wider
armholes, and has a longer zipper. The jacket is just the right
length so I can wear it comfortably while I'm sitting in a
wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   People who spend a great deal of time in a seated position often
prefer shirts or blouses with longer backs and shorter fronts.
Pants with a higher back also tend to be more comfortable, while a
low front waist band and longer inseam keep pants from cutting into
the body.
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING CROWDS AT THE MALL
</P>
<P>
   ``Navigating a shopping mall can be hard in a wheelchair,'' says
Kurt. ``It's also difficult for blind people, and those with mental
retardation or any number of disabilities. ``That's why we make
house calls.''
</P>
<P>
   With racks of Hawaiian shirts, khaki cargo pants, denim jeans,
and designer dresses, Kurt and Tom travel around to nursing homes
and all kinds of group living facilities. Bringing their wares
directly into the privacy of the living room and even the bedroom
when necessary, the two apparel pioneers try to make shopping fun
for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers sometimes tell us their favorite colors so we can
coordinate and personalize their own individual look,'' says Tom.
``Blind people enjoy feeling and choosing their own fabrics, and
we'll help them with the colors. I really enjoy this job because
the customers appreciate us coming so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not as glamorous as the bikini business,'' says
Kurt, who once sold swimsuits. ``But every day, I get to see how
happy these clothes make people. There's much more meaning in it.''

 &HT;    Few innocent of criticism aimed at Rocker
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Pardon me for venturing a bit deeper than
my usual frustrations with low-fat cooking, blossom end rot, fire
ants, Japanese beetles and being unable to reach a live human being
on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to be the only newspaper columnist in America who
failed to dive into the John Rocker affair.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in the history of journalism has so much been said and
written about so little. Who is John Rocker? Is he the secretary of
state or something? A member of Congress? Head of some powerful
organization? A college professor? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   His name appears at the tail end of a baseball box score. Beyond
mindless entertainment, what Rocker has to say amounts in public
issue to less than a spit into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Of all that I've read in the newspapers and heard on television,
Furman Bisher and Andy Young are the two who haven't gone off the
deep end. Bisher, The Atlanta Journal's senior sports columnist,
examined precisely what Rocker said to the Sports Illustrated
reporter. What he said wasn't as inflammatory as the reaction. How
many Braves fans, for example, have not entertained a suspicion
that the laid-back, board room demeanor of the team's overpaid
superstars has not contributed to World Series failures?
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Atlanta Constitution, Andy Young, who once
created his own controversy with a reference to ``smart ass white
boys,'' suggested that ``The 100 Percent Wrong Club, Atlanta's
oldest black sports club, should honor John Rocker for bringing his
reactionary attitudes into the open where they can be addressed
Atlanta style _ with humor, truth and reconciliation.'' (Humor,
truth and reconciliation should be in bold capital letters).
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' Young continued, ``similar insecurities and fears
are just beneath the surface in many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of us also tend to run off at the mouth without trying to
be mean or hateful. Count me in. Although I certainly don't hate
teen-agers, my granddaughter being one, I'm inclined to mumble
uncomplimentary remarks about ``idiot teen-age drivers.'' In
traffic, I've been known to cuss ``old fools,'' of which I am one.
</P>
<P>
   When kids see snowy white heads behind steering wheels they
refer to them as ``Q-tips.'' The label is somewhat derogatory to
elderly drivers, but not without a touch of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta is adapting to Third World immigration,
particularly workers from south of the border. Many speak or read
little English, if any at all. They are unfamiliar with streets and
highways. They are here because they are poor, and being poor, they
chug along on expressways in dilapidated cars and pickup trucks,
trying to figure out where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that many decent citizens, in the heat of rush hour
traffic, have referred to such drivers in uncomplimentary terms
that while innocuous within the confines of a private automobile,
would not wash in a national magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a sportswriter in another life, I can guess how
Rocker was helped to present himself as the most bigoted Georgian
since the late J.B. Stoner. I know how a large ego new to the
limelight can be encouraged to make outrageous statements to fit a
supposed macho image. I also know that a reporter, within ethical
boundaries of good journalism, can ask: ``Look fellow, do you know
what you are saying? Do You really mean that?'' The answer is part
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my tenure as ambassador to the United Nations in the
1970s,'' Andy Young wrote, ``the New York press even goaded me into
a series of headlines that served only to make my work more
difficult. And there was not the pressure of 60,000 sports fans
shouting at me. I know what it's like to be taunted, and it's not
hard for me to walk a mile in John's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know John Rocker, and have no desire to meet him. One
reason I got out of sportswriting shortly after major league sports
came to town was because I didn't like dealing with smart-ass
professional jocks. Over the years my regard for the species has
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   I do know somebody who knows John Rocker very well. This person,
who is far from being a racist and a bigot, tells me that he is a
nice enough fellow. He may be. Most people are.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante journalism scares me, even when practiced in what
practitioners think is a good cause. It can do more harm than a
pop-off professional athlete who has learned to throw
100-mile-an-hour strikes but not how to keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in his right mind falls for the baseball commissioner's
ploy of shipping Rocker off to be examined by a psychologist in
Baltimore. If the Braves want to cure what ails John Rocker, the
smartest thing they can do is send him to dinner with Andy Young.
If that happened, the Braves would have a better pitcher, Mr. and
Mrs. Rocker would have a better son, and Atlanta would be a better
community. I'd bet on it.

 &HT;    Incompetent people don't realize it, and that's bad news for
politics
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>

   WACO, Texas _ ``Gov. Bush, since you have only limited foreign
policy experience as governor of Texas, and since you have already
flunked a pop quiz on foreign affairs, do you feel confident that
you can handle the foreign policy duties required of the president
of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, let me remind you that Texas is larger than any
European country. I don't see you asking any European leaders if
they think they are competent enough to handle foreign affairs.
Right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, sir. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me finish. Of course, I feel confident that I can handle
the foreign policy duties of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only foreign policy experience the current occupant of the
White House had before he became governor of Arkansas was leading
anti-war demonstrations in Europe. I defended Texas in the National
Guard. I am supremely confident in my abilities to handle foreign
policy duties as president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore, you have worked more closely with the
president than any other vice president in history. But due to the
scandals that have plagued this president, the country now is
looking for moral leadership in the White House. Do you feel
confident that you can provide moral leadership even though you
have been so closely associated with President Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me remind you that I not only invented the Internet,
global warming and rap music, I also invented moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in a penthouse in Washington, D.C., I
helped harvest tobacco. Later, I accepted money from tobacco
lobbyists. Now I want to sue the pants off tobacco companies and
regulate all tobacco. That's moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told that the money I got from those Buddhist nuns
was for campaign financing, I gave it back. That's moral
leadership. I am confident beyond words that I can be the greatest
moral leader the White House has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a study reported in last month's Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, incompetent people tend to be
extremely self-assured. Competent people, however, tend to have
doubts about their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Incompetent people, according to the study by Cornell psychology
Professor Dr. David A. Dunning, are doubly impaired.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, they are incompetent. To make matters worse, they
not only don't know that they are incompetent, they actually are
supremely confident in their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Dunning and his research partner _ Dr. Justin Kruger, now at the
University of Illinois _ believe that the skills needed to achieve
competence are the same skills needed to recognize competence.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about clueless. People who can't tell jokes believe they
are really funny. People who can tell jokes don't think they are
very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Besides testing humor with a panel of professional comedians as
judges, the study also tested logic and grammar skills.
</P>
<P>
   People who tested lowest in logic skills ranked their logic
skills higher than people who tested highest in logic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Incompetent test-takers had an over-inflated opinion of their
abilities, and competent subjects underestimated their powers.
</P>
<P>
   The professors expressed self-doubt about their study, which
means they are competent and their study is valid.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, who are singularly self-assured, weren't tested.
</P>
<P>
   They overflow with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   This must mean that politicians are incompetent and don't know
it.
</P>
<P>
   I give politicians more credit. I think they know that they
don't know but think the voters will not support someone who admits
it. They are right. Isn't that funny?

 &HT;    Learn by example not to copy from sample
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have to take issue with the oft-repeated adage that
``it takes all kinds to make a world.'' Some kinds we could do
without.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet recently, I came across an astounding
revelation. A woodworker blithely announced to the world that he
had just built a quilt rack ``as a Christmas present that I copied
based on one from a store (I bought the rack, brought it home,
measured and traced, returned rack to the store and built it).''
</P>
<P>
   This freely made statement drew predictable responses. One man
said he couldn't believe the guy would admit such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Another, more succinctly, said ``You are not a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   The rackmaker, however, remained undaunted. He drew people into
a long, irrelevant argument over copyright, claiming such things as
not being liable for violating a copyright as long as he doesn't
sell what he reproduced and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright, in my view, has nothing to do with it. Lots of folks
might see a nice picture of a quilt rack, note its more desirable
features, and make one similar to it, or even as close to it as
they could get. Nobody's coming after them for that unless they try
to market the things. If Sam Maloof sent lawyers after everybody
who has tried to rip off his chair designs he'd spend all his time
in court.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, first, the brass it takes to essentially
appropriate this item from a store and then return it as
unsatisfactory when in fact is was so satisfactory that he wanted
to copy it. Second, and worse, is the kind of witlessness required
to even resort to something like this.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world does this person need to take the object home,
measure it and trace it? A quilt rack isn't a chair. It doesn't
matter if it's 48 inches high or 50 inches high or whatever; it can
be as high and as wide as you want it to be. If it's got a lot of
curlicues or something on it, then take a pencil and a notepad and
make a rough sketch. Better yet, think up your own curlicues.
</P>
<P>
   I feel bad now for being so tough on people who feel they can't
build something without someone else's plans. At least they don't
require the original object. I hope for his sake that this person
doesn't decide he needs to copy a piece that's in the Smithsonian
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The copier even went so far as to argue that the rack wasn't all
that unique and thus probably wasn't subject to copyright to begin
with. Isn't that wonderful? Now he's admitting that even his taste,
as well as his judgment, his honesty and his skills, is
questionable.

his Soviet benefactors insisted, as a price for withdrawing their

   RELIGION-SAINTS _ Saints are terrible role models,'' the Rev.
Joseph Goetz writes engagingly in his little book, Mirrors of God

&HT;     ENTERTAINING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MARTHA STEWART AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KAREN HARAM  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For the Martha Stewarts of the world _ who think
nothing of putting countless hours, money and energy into pulling
off a party _ entertaining with style is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest, having friends over for cocktails, dinner and
the like can be a stressful affair.
</P>
<P>
   That's where design consultant Kristin Lyle comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, who now lives in San Antonio, has turned her experience as
a successful Washington, D.C., hostess and her love of entertaining
into a business, Designs for Dining.
</P>
<P>
   Though she ``helps with anything they want,'' she focuses on
teaching clients how to entertain creatively, graciously and with
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn about their lifestyle, we talk about time management,
getting food on the table, the flow of the room. I don't help them
cook, but I help them discuss with the caterer what they like to
eat and I encourage them to cook several dishes themselves so it
feels like a home meal,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle is the first to concede that years ago, having friends or
business acquaintances over wasn't that big a deal. But today's
busy lifestyles make entertaining more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal: to get clients comfortable with the idea of
entertaining others, without trying to pull off a Martha
Stewart-like party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining your own style is most important,'' she says,
explaining that the food you serve and the decorations you select
should express your personality.
</P>
<P>
   For Lyle, that means using functional handcrafts and art, rather
than formal china and silver and stiff floral arrangements (``which
can be a little boring,'' she says), as her decor.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle got started in her business in 1987 because ``I really was
a very good housewife,'' she says. ``I'm single again. What I do is
I convey to other people all the mistakes, all the successes, all
the insecurities that they can derive some information from.''
</P>
<P>
   As an avid traveler and collector, Lyle has spent time visiting
other cultures, buying artwork, antiques and the occasional ``odd
thing,'' which she then uses to set the scene for dinners and
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started my business, I went home to my family for a
vacation. I looked around and thought, `My family has been doing
this for a long time.' They were very concerned about presentation
and making things nice for their guests as well as expressing their
artistic abilities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of successful entertaining is simple, she says:
``Understand your own style and make the guests who are coming to
your table feel comfortable and welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lyle, that means using her ``found objects'' to add interest
to her dinner table. ``I don't fold napkins very well and I don't
follow directions well, so for napkin rings, I'll use anything that
has a hole in it _ old skeleton keys, lacquered baby bracelets from
Burma. My bent is to help people look at what they already have and
see how they can use it at the table,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as a centerpiece, Lyle might use an old wooden
money tiller to hold jars of jams and condiments. An old cigar mold
can hold silverware. Purses with wooden handles from India can
serve as place mats.
</P>
<P>
   She also tries ``to get people away from candle and bouquet
centerpieces. I try to get arrangements down the center of the
table so all guests can see it. I collect wooden puzzles _ often I
put those on the table. I don't think flowers should go on the
table all the time. You can use fruits and vegetables or other
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around to see what you have and incorporate it into your
table,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas are seemingly boundless. For a Middle Eastern dinner,
she suggested her client use an Oriental rug as the cloth for the
table. At a Washington engagement party honoring a newly graduated
lawyer, Lyle used an old scale with ivy to represent the ivied
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes hostesses nervous is the judgment of others. They
think they're not free to do what they're most comfortable with for
fear that others will think they're not as sophisticated as they'd
like to be,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle describes her style of entertaining as ``formal but fun.
Formal is translated into structure for the hostess so she can get
the meal on the table, so that guests know how they're supposed to
act at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be able to use our expensive things _ the
Waterford crystal, Grandma's silver. But the fun is using them in a
way to let guests enjoy the evening or dinner rather than being
intimidated by it.''

&HT;     A DECENT FILM ARISES FROM `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Williams wrote the score for ``Angela's Ashes,'' but he
needn't have bothered. The producers needn't have hired him. There
are plenty of other dirges available for free in the public domain,
including Chopin's Funeral March, that would have provided a
similar air of plodding, pallid gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Before we get any further, please note: It is possible to make a
lovely film about death. It is possible to make a lively film about
death. It is possible to make a humorous film about death. It is
even possible to make a lovely, lively, humorous film about death,
and indeed, there have been many.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alan Parker tried to make such a one from Frank
McCourt's megaselling memoir of a miserable Irish boyhood. He did
try. And there are moments of loveliness; there are moments of
life; there are moments, sparkling and fleet, of humor. Same as any
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: funerals. We need to employ the plural. Many people
die in ``Angela's Ashes.'' So many people die in the first
half-hour alone that moviegoers may wonder whether it's a film
they're attending or a re-enactment of the bubonic plague. If they
read the book (I didn't, as a matter of reviewing philosophy), they
may admire the film's faithful rendering of the events in young
Frankie's life. They may sit in awe of its atmosphere, its acting,
its period-film verisimilitude and muted light.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's gray and black. What isn't gray and black is
chalk-white _ the color of death. A dead baby is chalk-white. A
dead toddler is chalk-white. A teen-ager dying of consumption is
chalk-white. Coffins are chalk-white. The camera lingers on
corpses, on pale, barely living faces, on the oozy, diseased eyes
of a child injured from working with coal dust.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Limerick, Ireland, circa World War II. It is the
Ireland of Frank McCourt and Alan Parker _ Parker, who here trods
the Old Sod for the first time since ``The Commitments.'' It is sad
territory, eternally damp and thick with refuse. The grime of
poverty covers Limerick like a blanket. Children wear rags on their
bodies, bicycle tires on their feet. Homes flood with rain. It
always rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' is a well-made film, pretty to look at,
movingly acted by a strong cast: Robert Carlyle as Frank's charming
drunk of a dad, Emily Watson as his desperate mother, a trio of
fine juvenile actors (Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael Legge) as
Frank at different ages. The screenplay, by Parker and Laura Jones
(``Oscar and Lucinda,'' ``The Portrait of a Lady''), is episodic
but deft, weaving bemused adult narration (by Andrew Bennett, not
Frank McCourt) with child's-eye memories of a rough-trade life.
</P>
<P>
   It boasts charming bits of comic relief. Frank's trips to the
confessional booth are touching and spry; his teen-age sexual
exploits are randy fun; and his pie-eyed worship of all things
American is laced with fetching irony. ``Ohhh, America!'' lilts the
narrator. ``Where no one has bad teeth, and everyone has a
lavatory!'' There are moments, too, of revelation, flashes of
compassion, light and hope that creep through the overcast gloom.
By no means is ``Angela's Ashes'' a bad film.
</P>
<P>
   But in his quest to make a great one, Parker pushes too hard. As
he did with ``Evita,'' ``Mississippi Burning'' and ``Midnight
Express'' _ with most of his films, except ``The Commitments'' _
the director bears down so heavily on his material that the viewer
comes away feeling beaten about the head with a sandbag. The film
doesn't need a lachrymose John Williams score. It doesn't need
Michael Seresin's shades-of-gray photography.
</P>
<P>
   Had Parker made a scoreless movie in blinding primary colors,
the results would have been no less heart-breaking. They would not,
however, have been a dirge.

&HT;     BEAUTY IN ALL BUT THE END OF `AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' is not a happy film about happy
people. It is a grim, beautiful film about grim, beautiful people
cast in the grim, beautiful, blue-gray light of London in the rain.
And it rains a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the romantic-mystical novel by Graham Greene, ``The End
of the Affair'' was adapted and directed by Neil Jordan, whose last
two efforts concerned a woman who swaps dreams with a serial killer
(the gawdawful ``In Dreams'') and a violent ragamuffin who has
visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary (the prickly but splendiferous
``The Butcher Boy'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' bears no immediate resemblance to
either film _ it's closer, in aesthetic and mood, to Jordan's
best-known work, ``The Crying Game'' _ but it points yet again to
one of the director's most persistent and fascinating
preoccupations. He may work in a visual medium, but he's equally
concerned with what we don't see _ the supernatural, the miraculous
and the secreted away. Greene's tortured Catholicism is a perfect
fit in this regard, and it's a wonder Jordan waited so long to
tackle one of his novels. Grimness and beauty, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' boasts the most straightforward, least
elliptical title of any film released in the last six months
(except, maybe, ``Bats''). Set during and immediately after World
War II, the tale is a rapturous post-mortem of the romance between
novelist and Greene stand-in Maurice Bendrix (a gorgeously
suffering Ralph Fiennes) and a stifled politician's wife, Sarah
Miles (Julianne Moore, radiant in sorrow).
</P>
<P>
   Maurice and Sarah love each other terribly _ their intercourse
consists of wild, sweaty clutches set to air-raid sirens and
percussive German bombs. Falling plaster accompanies coitus. Dark
poetry drives their conversation. ``You think love ends when you
don't see me?'' asks Sarah of her obsessive, jealous lover. He
replies: ``To be is to be perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit, the Greene unseen _ how it plagues Maurice. Maurice
knows nothing beyond his desire for Sarah, which is really just
another form of misery; if, as he declares early on, ``happiness is
even harder to write than goodness,'' then he is his own best
fictional creation. Here goes an unhappy, foul fellow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's before Sarah leaves him. She ends the affair _
abruptly, without a peep _ but not the obsession, which turns
Maurice's love story into a self-described ``diary of hate.'' When
Maurice learns from Sarah's clueless husband, Henry (Stephen Rea,
earning hushed sympathy), that Sarah might be having an affair,
he's haunted by the possibility that she might love someone else
and hires a private eye to tail her. ``Perhaps I wouldn't be
writing this if I had known then who it was I hated,'' he intones
in narration, undulant and bitter. ``Was it Henry? Was it Sarah? Or
was it some other, soon to be revealed to me?'' In the identity of
the ``other'' lies the film's central mystery _ and its central
mysticism, which asks large, looming questions about love and the
invisible beloved. Much of this will be familiar to anyone who's
read anything by Greene, but fans of the novel ought to be warned _
Jordan plays fast and loose with the ending. He spiffs it up with a
jaunt to Brighton that adds nothing to the narrative and nearly
cripples the film.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, because until the final act ``The End of the
Affair'' offers a sinuous ride through the pathology of desire:
gracefully acted, seamlessly directed and seductively fraught with
passion. ``I am a jealous man,'' says Maurice to Sarah, in the
shadows of flashback eros. ``I'm jealous of this stocking, because
it does what I can't _ it kisses your whole leg. I'm jealous of
this button, because it's with you the whole day _ and I'm not.''
How lovingly speaks a man seized by hate.

ANOTHER TEEN TENNIS TRAUMA IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Not even John McEnroe in his cracked-pepper salad
days of bizarre exploits hogged the front pages for three days
running. Mac might salivate enviously, perhaps admiringly, at the
stir-fry a mere child named Jelena Dokic is creating across her
adopted homeland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Childe Jelena, a 16-year-old tennis player seven years out of
Serbia, has pushed Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams,
Lindsay Davenport, and Martina Hingis out of the way with
bulldozingly sharp, black headlines _ even though the kid didn't
last much more than an hour in the Australian Open singles last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual, but disturbing, too, because it isn't pleasant watching
a juvenile unravel under the pressure of national attention and
expectations, as well as the stress caused by the very wrong
situation of being the breadwinner for her immigrant family of
four.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall Jelena's June '99 jump into the world's
consciousness: an historic upheaval in which she beat No. 1 Hingis
in the opening round at Wimbledon. A demure blonde qualifier ranked
No. 129, she was a definite comer, ascending to No. 39 by the time
this Open began. And then she began coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected first-round defeat of Australia's top female by a
no-name Hungarian, Rita Kuti Kis, didn't appear to be
tournament-quaking until hours afterwards. Five hours late for the
mandatory press conference (and thus fined $2,500), Dokic read a
rambling prepared statement, knocking her foe as ``a player who
can't play, never could play'' and insisting she herself could
still beat just about anybody.
</P>
<P>
   That was only Act I in the Dokic daily drama that could be
entitled ``As Jelena's World Burns.''
</P>
<P>
   Act II was her Page 1 accusation in the tabloid Melbourne Sun
Herald that a conspiracy was at work against her because of her
Serbian origins. She asserted draws were being fixed so she played
the toughest opponents. It was preposterous, as the draws are made
publicly and professionally. If anything, the Aussie draw seemed
rigged in her favor, presenting her with a cupcake, No. 86 Kuti
Kis, who hadn't won a match on a hard court in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Act III the next day, when her papa, the burly,
bearded Damir Dokic, a frequent troublemaker, assaulted a TV
crewman outside their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday brought Act IV, following a doubles victory alongside
Jennifer Capriati. Cooly, with fire in her blue eyes, Jelena
stonewalled. She apologized for nothing and charged the Sun Herald
with making up everything, saying she had demanded the tapes. An
editor at the newspaper says the tapes confirm her published
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   If you squeezed into overflowing Court 3 with 3,000 others
Wednesday, while 37,029 patrons flooded Melbourne Park, you had a
very uncomfortable feeling: There, in short skirts, were a
catastrophe-in-the-making next to one that had already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Little Girl Lost, Jelena Dokic, accompanying Veteran
Little Girl Lost, Jennifer Capriati. The too-much-too-quick kids
playing a duet, and you wondered whether Dokic would have to go
through the shattering Capriati had taken, but from which she seems
to be emerging at 23.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the help and guidance Dokic so sorely needs as she
flits about the world, a girl in a cut-throat occupation? Where
were the agents and parents and the Women's Tennis Association when
Capriati needed them? Where are they now for Dokic? And for the
other teenies, who shouldn't be allowed into a professional sport
before age 18?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know I'm ultra-conservative, and that wouldn't stand up in
court. But if these kids stayed home and finished high school,
graduating legitimately before being cast out to fend for
themselves, they and their sport would be better off for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some are getting the proper care and counseling, of course (like
Venus and Serena Williams). But not Dokic. Her old man is another
member of the long-running IBDC (International Bad Dads Club) of
tennis, along with Stefano Capriati, Peter Graf, Roland Jaeger,
Marinko Lucic, and Jim Pierce _ pushing their gifted daughters,
oblivious to education, living off the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a young kid is supporting the family, it's just too much
pressure to win,'' says Chris Evert. ``My dad had a job. He didn't
let me turn pro until I was 18. But these are different times, and
the money available is overwhelmingly tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   Damir Dokic did do well by steering his family away from Croatia
when that country was at war, and then from Serbia before it
exploded. But he believes father knows best about everything,
including tennis coaching and dealing with a public for which he is
ill-prepared. If Jelena is lucky, he'll hire a responsible coach
who knows the ways of this tough and competitive business, stop
telling her the world is against Serbs, and get a job.

&HT;     WHY WE WATCH THE GOLDEN GLOBES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us ponder, for a moment, the true meaning of the Golden
Globe Awards.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the Oscars. They aren't the Emmys. They don't
reflect the consensus of Hollywood or the public. They represent
nothing beyond the (allegedly compromised _ ssshh! don't say
anything) opinions of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,
which basically amounts to 82 people who write for Lithuanian
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   True, not all 82 of them write for Lithuanian newspapers. Some
of them write for newspapers and magazines in Thailand, Malta,
Finland, Belize and Bangladesh. To name a few. This is not to say
anything against Thailand, Malta, Finland, Belize or Bangladesh (or
Lithuania), or anywhere else in the world. Nor is it meant to
insult or belittle the fine journalists in the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   But.
</P>
<P>
   As you crouch before your artificial hearth Sunday night (8 to
11 p.m. EST on NBC), ask yourself: Who are these people? What are
the Golden Globes? Why do we watch them year after year? You may
answer yourself thus: These people put on one of the most
entertainingly frivolous shows of the year. The Golden Globes are a
meaningless exercise in vanity and profligate Hollywood consumerism
that have no bearing on the plight of world peace. And we watch
them because we're sheep. Baaaa.
</P>
<P>
   Not to reduce everything to overly simplistic lists (oh, let's),
but the reasons behind the sturdy popularity of the Golden Globes
might be summarized as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ They give us a chance to ogle celebrities_ and
celebrity-ogling is what makes America great.
</P>
<P>
   You doubt this? When was the last time you had a water-cooler
conversation that didn't mention Oprah? Why do we care, and do we
ever, what boyfriend Gwyneth dumped? What Dennis Rodman's wearing?
Whether Jennifer Lopez really and truly loves Sean ``Puffy'' Combs?
Just see if you can make it through a day without reading about
and/or chatting about and/or channel surfing to catch a glimpse of
a star. G'head. Try it. Betcha can't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hope springs eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Awards ceremonies, to paraphrase a witticism about second
marriages, are a triumph of hope over experience. We hope the best
movie will win best picture. We hope the best actor will win best
actor. And we hope _ this year, at least _ that ``The Sopranos''
wins everything in every category, or at least in the four
categories (yielding five nominations) in which the show got
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   We hope, or some of us do, that ``The Insider'' gets best drama.
We hope Hilary Swank gets best actress for ``Boys Don't Cry.'' We
hope Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington and Kevin Spacey win best
actor (in a drama) in a three-way tie.
</P>
<P>
   We hope ``Being John Malkovich'' gets best comedy. We hope Reese
Witherspoon wins best actress (in a comedy) for ``Election.'' We
hope Jim Carrey gets best actor (in a comedy) for ``Man on the
Moon,'' but we hope he doesn't talk with his butt cheeks while
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   _ They're just a bunch of shameless party animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Globes is a party,'' declaims the show's executive
producer, Barry Adelman, in a freeze-dried interview disseminated
by the PR whizzes at NBC. ``It's a gathering of people from both
motion pictures and television, and for that night at least, they
throw away those barriers that so often separate them when you see
them on other award shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the main difference between the Globes and the Oscars
is: At the Globes, everyone gets drunk before the ceremony. Instead
of sitting stiff-upper-lipped in row after row of auditorium seats,
Globe nominees gather around circular dinner tables in party-ready
poses. They eat. They drink. They drink. Every now and then, one of
them gets up to grab a statuette and say thanks a bunch, this is a
collaborative business, hi, mom, then sits back down again and
drinks some more. And everyone is very, very merry.
</P>
<P>
   Finally ...
</P>
<P>
   _ You never know when Christine Lahti might run off to the
ladies' room.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great moment: In the middle of the 1998 awards
ceremony, erstwhile ``Chicago Hope'' star Christine Lahti got up
and went to the bathroom. Which was fine. Except no sooner had she
left to powder her nose than, whoopsy, she won the award for best
actress in a TV drama. The ensuing confusion _ during which Robin
Williams jumped on stage and paged Lahti in Spanish _ lent an
endearing goofiness to the whole evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Globes are like that: spontaneous and accident-prone. At the
Oscars, nominees do not get up to greet the plumbing two minutes
before their awards are announced. Nominees have no need to get up
and greet the plumbing two minutes before their awards are
announced, because nominees have not been drinking for the last
hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   This, in essence, is the deeper meaning of the Golden Globes.
It's not the pursuit of high art. It's not recognition for finely
honed craftsmanship. It's not even the opportunity to study the
whims of high-class fashion victims (necklines? hemlines?
cummerbunds? ties?), although that certainly has its charm.
</P>
<P>
   No, we watch the Golden Globes because it is our best chance to
see members of the Hollywood elite make complete and utter fools of
themselves. We watch to make us feel superior and them seem human.
We watch because the Golden Globes are a unifier, a common ground,
a time to join hands across the global village and unite, as one,
in the shared pursuit of kitsch. And we watch them because they're
on.
</P>
<P>
   Baaaa.

PUBLIC PAYS HEAVY PRICE FOR JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was appropriate that the erstwhile Washington Bullets, er,
Wizards, played the Dallas Mavericks on the first day of Michael
Jordan's reign as Urban Savior.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have undergone significant ownership changes, but the
different ways in which the media treated the transactions revealed
the inordinate amount of attention devoted to celebrity in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The once-objective Washington Post typified the media's
obsequiousness toward Jordan and the virtual news blackout of Mark
Cuban. On Jan. 17, Cuban, the founder of Broadcast.com, finalized
his deal to become the majority owner of the Mavericks. He paid
about $280 million and owns 70 percent of the team. With the
exception of a four-paragraph brief Jan. 5, the Washington Post
never told its readers anything more about the deal. (The Boston
Globe was even more cursory, only running two sentences Jan. 5.)
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Cuban is just your run-of-the-mill billionaire whose
company was recently bought by Yahoo for $6 billion. Like that
happens every day. But not even this extraordinary geek deserved
such shabby treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, on the other hand, might as well have received the Nobel
Prize, cured cancer, and turned the nation's last colony into the
51st state.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is a great basketball player and star, no question about
it. Was he the best of the century? Debatable. Can he save the
Wizards? Well, that's unclear. Although no one should bet against
him, not even Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, could
transform the Washington Senators into a championship team. But Ted
didn't have Jordan's star power.
</P>
<P>
   The Post led the national media coverage by running at least 10
stories on Jordan's minority stake, including two on the front page
and a huge photograph. ESPN and FoxSports News carried Wednesday's
news conference live and delivered reports throughout the night and
Thursday on the impact and viability of Jordan's reign. Questions
about his ability to deal with salary-cap restrictions and his
relationship with super agent David Falk were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Most news organizations offered stories saying Jordan's return
would somehow lift the NBA, still reeling from last year's lockout,
dwindling attendance, and drooping television ratings. In addition,
a few stories suggested Jordan would be able to spark the
resurgence of Washington, a city plagued by inadequate public
schools, an aging infrastructure, and a service economy largely
based on government jobs, lawyers, and politicians. Some even
hinted Jordan's presence would attract more high-tech investment.
</P>
<P>
   Three words for all the gushing: Stop the insanity.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, every economic study on sports franchises,
especially those subsidized by taxpayer money, has shown that
stadiums and teams do not trigger economic expansions and only
serve to shift consumer spending from one sector of a local economy
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is a lot of things, but an urban savior is not
one of them. Jordan is for Jordan, and although his presence is
easy to take, it always comes with a price tag. Dunk like Mike and
buy his shoes. Smell like Mike and buy his cologne. Talk like Mike
and use his phone service. Be like Mike and watch his cartoon
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is a businessman, and once his money starts getting
funny, once he tires of having a stable of one-on-one partners and
attending fancy dinners and operas, he might return to his old
self, the one that doesn't care about the public good and does
worship the dollar bill. Remember his infamous line to Senate
hopeful Harvey Gantt, the first black to challenge Jesse Helms,
when Gantt wanted and needed Jordan to attend a fund-raiser in the
early '90s? ``Republicans buy Nikes, too,'' Jordan said in turning
down Gantt.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jordan brings a championship to Washington, city
residents can't pin their future on some sort of intangible civic
pride.
</P>
<P>
   No one is asking Cuban to save Dallas. Nor should the media ask
Jordan to save the District.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, the Mavericks smoked the Wizards.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   It's official: Dick Enberg joined CBS to work with Dan Dierdorf
during the NFL season and as play-by-play announcer on college
basketball and US Open tennis. Enberg will also contribute to golf
coverage, including the Masters and the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Enberg is recognized as one of the premier broadcasters
in sports television,' said CBS Sports president Sean McManus.
``There are few who can boast his accomplishments in the past
quarter-century. His passion for sports, especially NFL football,
is reflected in everything he has done. We are extremely excited to
welcome Dick to CBS Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Enberg will team with Billy Packer Saturday to call the Ohio
State-St. John's game at 4 p.m.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A blizzard of memos outlining dramatic plans to scrap
the past and embrace the future. Packed gatherings where workers
listen to their leaders articulate bold concepts. Lapel pins
announcing devotion to a new philosophy. And information kiosks
designed to re-educate people.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't in the midst of a quintessentially capitalist
transformation, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. might evoke
Russian Revolution redux. As it is, the big insurer is enacting
radical changes to ready itself for a taskmaster no less
hard-driving than the Bolsheviks: Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   After 138 years as a company owned by millions of ordinary
policyholders, Hancock is about to put itself in the hands of
investors. The impending change has forced a massive cultural shift
at the Boston insurer, which must learn new fiscal discipline and
imbue nearly 9,000 employees with a market mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which will sell about $1.8 billion in stock on Thursday
in the insurance world's second-largest initial public offering,
has spent three years and $100 million, not including investment
bankers' fees, preparing for the change. Most of the money has gone
to actuaries and consultants, who have calculated payouts to
policyholders. Such customers, who are a mutual's nominal owners,
will receive cash, stock, or heftier policies in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, policyholders will still own as much as 70 percent
of the new Hancock. But with small blocks of shares, their power
will pale against that of big institutional investors. Scores of
policyholders are expected to cash out in coming months, giving the
professionals even more influence over the company.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Hancock is racing to banish the sleepy 9-to-5
ethic that exemplifies the stodgy insurance business, and to
embrace rigorous concepts like shareholder value, efficiency, and
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden, you will be measured,'' said John O'Brien, who
heads Allmerica Financial, the Worcester insurer that went public
in 1995. ``Being public creates a more competitive environment. You
have to think about a lot of hard things that your previous
structure didn't require you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With sales of life insurance dwindling as investors opt for
mutual funds and worry about outliving savings, insurers like
Hancock are casting off their mutual ownership to compete more
aggressively with their publicly traded brethren and with banks and
brokerages. That means having a currency _ stock _ to finance
acquisitions and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At a company whose chairman and chief executive, Stephen Brown,
deferred to company lawyers when asked to recite quarterly earnings
at a regulatory hearing last fall, going public means acquiring a
more market-oriented mindset.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance of the employee cafeteria at Hancock's signature
glass tower in the Back Bay, a giant kiosk resembling a lunar
landing module will flash Hancock's stock price, CNBC financial
news, and New York Stock Exchange quotes. Outside company
elevators, more than 60 sleek, aluminum columns with display
screens will shimmy with Hancock's live stock price. (Hancock will
trade under the ticker symbol JHF.)
</P>
<P>
   And last fall employees attended a series of ``What does Wall
Street want?'' sessions explaining concepts like price-earnings
ratios and dividend yield. Such measures are rarely used by
traditional insurers, which employ their own arcane accounting
rules to track a notoriously complex business.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their brave new world, Hancock accountants have
taken crash courses in fundamentals like return on equity.
Executives spent hours last fall listening in on analysts' calls
with publicly traded insurers. And individual business units within
Hancock are learning to meet performance objectives rather than
just expect funding.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 13th-largest life insurer, with about $130 billion
in assets, even had medallions, cuff links, and lapel pins made
with the initials JHF, for John Hancock Financial Services Inc.,
the company's new name. The accessories sport two ``15''s,
symbolizing Hancock's goal of achieving an annual 15 percent return
on equity and 15 percent earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   With no outside pressure to cut costs, even profitable mutuals
are less efficient than their publicly traded brethren.
</P>
<P>
   To give staffers a stake in the future, management is seeking
board approval to award each employee 200 shares in the new
company. And the insurer will increasingly compensate sales agents
on performance, and not according to what Hancock president and
chief executive-elect David D'Alessandro has called ``the Midas
muffler man system,'' or flat commissions, until recently the norm
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   By going public, ``you're trying to change some behaviors,'' one
senior Hancock executive said last year. ``David's theory is that
employees need to understand what we're doing, how we're doing it,
and why we're doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic change has already affected the executive suite.
D'Alessandro, a marketing whiz, is set to take over the CEO job in
mid-2000, when Brown, an actuary by training, steps aside.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and its underwriters are in a Securities and Exchange
Commmission-mandated ``quiet period'' that forbids them from
speaking to the press about the company and its forthcoming sale.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is the first in a group of competitors, including Sun
Life Assurance of Canada, Metropolitan Life, and Prudential, the
nation's largest insurer, that are scheduled to conduct initial
stock offerings in 2000. The sales, likely to total around $10
billion, will constitute a good chunk of the new equity coming onto
the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of firms, especially Internet start-ups, are taking
advantage of a booming stock market and voracious investor appetite
to issue publicly traded stock. But a mutual's conversion to a
listed company has complexities all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Mutuals, as insurers such as Hancock are known, are owned by and
operated for the benefit of their policyholders, who want to see
extra profits accumulated for a rainy day. Investors, on the other
hand, care most about shareholder, not `policyholder,' value.
Investors cringe at idle capital, and want surplus funds paid out
to shareholders or plowed into strategic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual policyholders want high dividends and low premiums and
are generally unconcerned with expanding operations. Shareholders
want the opposite. Mutuals focus on increasing statutory capital,
the money pool used to pay out claims, while investors look to
generate operating earnings and income.
</P>
<P>
   Mutuals generally ignore short-term performance, concentrate on
the long-term, and reconcile their balance sheets at the end of the
year. Stock companies are under grueling pressure to meet quarterly
earnings projections, and face intense scrutiny from analysts and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Actuaries _ the statisticians who compute insurance premiums and
risks _ and sales agents reign supreme at mutuals. At stock
insurers, the action is with the chief financial officer, who must
win the confidence of the brokerage analysts whose buy-or-sell
recommendations are important to the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders are passive compared with the banks, pension
funds, brokers, insurers, and other institutional investors who
will own much of Hancock. Shareholders can exert enormous pressure
on publicly traded companies to perform well by forcing changes in
executive ranks and shifts in strategy, including a sale of the
company to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   By going public, ``there's a shift in who you're trying to
please,'' said Kevin Gough, an analyst at Conning &AMP; Associates, a
consulting firm. ``You're going to have to be aware of what the
shareholder wants, or you'll find yourself with a new board of
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock likes to boast that it already acts like a growth-minded
stock company. The insurer's return on equity _ a key measure of
financial performance _ was 13 percent last year, in line with some
public companies and several percentage points above most insurers.
And the company is working to grow its mutual fund and variable
annuity units. The latter are funds with insurance-like features.
</P>
<P>
   To pave the way for going public, Hancock has recently hired
many of its top brass from noninsurance financial services firms.
It eased out executives not ready for the change, including its
general counsel and its fund division head, Edward Boudreau, say
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock also put itself on a diet and muscle-building routine.
The company, whose 1998 net income was $448.5 million on revenue of
$6.9 billion, cut $65 million out of expenses last year and boosted
spending on technology by $80 million, according to a ratings
agency analyst. The insurer wants to cut its expense base by 10 to
15 percent a year.

<P>
   For its big day Thursday, Hancock is trying to line up New York
Yankees baseball stars to stand next to its chairman, who will ring
the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. A proposal to use famed
slugger Mark McGwire fell through when the press got wind of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   On the road since the new year in the corporate jets of Morgan
Stanley, its lead investment banker, Hancock executives have also
had to answer sticky questions from investors about the $1 billion
in potential losses it faces from reinsurance contracts amid
turmoil in that business. Actual losses will likely be far less,
and Hancock has calmed investors by saying payouts would come out
of its $5.2 billion surplus, not earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Hancock has tried to persuade investors that it can
grow. Management panicked last fall when a furor erupted over
Hancock's inability to locate 25 percent of its 3.3 million
policyholders. While Hancock eventually traced half of them, the
company worried about the impact of the administrative snafu on its
well-known brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been preparing for going public for a while, so it's
not going to be a total shock,'' said Richard Major, an analyst at
A.M. Best, a ratings agency. But he added: ``They will definitely
be answering to a different master.''

SELIG NOW THE BEST POWER HITTER IN BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the idea of a centralized control of Major League
Baseball was merely a notion. Too many obstacles, legal and
economic. The game suffered because of its dependence on a
commissioner who had neither the power nor trust of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed Wednesday in Phoenix as Allan ``Bud''
Selig, baseball commissioner since July 2, 1998, was given powers
that make him the first true baseball czar since Kenesaw Mountain
Landis (1920-1944). Bolstered by the restructure of the American
and National leagues and the elimination of their presidents, the
concept of Central Baseball is now a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Selig now has the power to block trades and redistribute the
wealth in order to restore competitive balance. All things that the
public had been led to believe went with the job. History tells us
that in the last two decades, it wasn't that way at all.
</P>
<P>
   Selig now has the power to fine clubs up to $2 million under the
``best interest'' of baseball clause that had been ineffective as a
tool for controlling baseball ownership in recent years. The
previous limit was $250,000. He can fine club employees $500,000,
up from $25,000. In other words, if some owner with deep pockets
attempts to control the market, the commissioner will be able to
give more than lip service if he judges such actions harmful to
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The target of such scrutiny, owners admitted, are the big
spenders found mostly among the large-market clubs. Since the end
of the 1994-95 strike, just one team in the bottom half of the
payroll spending has advanced to the postseason (the 1997 Houston
Astros). Of the top 10 spenders in 1999, eight reached the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder why your favorite club has trouble staying in
contention, it boils down to this: The rich are able to refurbish
their roster each year. In 1999, the world champion Yankees had a
payroll of $92 million. Texas was next at $81 million and got to
play one playoff game in its home park. Atlanta, which lost to New
York, spent $79 million. That sort of makes the $72,330,656 spent
by the Red Sox small change. But that's what it takes to reach the
AL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   And before we forget about it, the Yankees are reportedly on the
verge of signing shortstop Derek Jeter to a seven-year contract
worth $118.5 million. Perhaps with Selig, the all-out escalation of
salaries will subside. But since much of what has happened must
also come under the scrutiny of the players association, let's not
rush to the conclusion that the new czar has supreme power. In the
mid-1980s, owners were found guilty of collusion and it cost them
$87 million.
</P>
<P>
   The union is usually ahead of ownership in these matters, so the
powers given Selig depends upon how they play out. As owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers, Selig was a strong advocate of revenue sharing
that owners subsequently voted into place. Ownership felt a luxury
tax and the threat of $60 million payrolls would keep all teams _
small-market and large-market _ in place. It didn't work out that
way.
</P>
<P>
   In hammering out the collective bargaining agreement that came
out of the 1994-95 strike, the union retained power to approve any
revenue redistribution. That includes the owners' revenue-sharing
plan. Another roadblock is that Selig can't redistribute the wealth
in a manner that would violate baseball's credit lines with banks.
</P>
<P>
   The best interest of baseball clause served commissioner Bowie
Kuhn well on June 18, 1976, when he blocked Oakland owner Charles
O. Finley from selling pitcher Rollie Fingers and outfielder Joe
Rudi to Boston for $2 million and pitcher Vida Blue to the Yankees
for $1.5 million. But it cost commissioner Fay Vincent his job when
he used it in 1990. Subsequently owners gutted the clause in
January 1994. Their message was clear: owners decide, not the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig is both _ although his daughter Wendy controls the
Brewers. As owner of a small-market club since 1970, teams trusted
he would act in their interests when he became acting commissioner
following Vincent's resignation Sept. 7, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Like Landis, Selig can do as much with the threat of his power
than someone else might do with decisions that might be ignored or
overturned. Thursday, teams gave even more power, in the form of
all their Internet rights _ including radio broadcasts and
potential video _ to the commissioner's office. Now he could take
away millions in national TV revenue from teams like the Yankees
and Braves and give it to clubs such as the Expos and Twins. He
could say all of baseball's Internet money will go to the small
markets. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have extended the power to Selig, they say, because
they have looked in a mirror and seen the enemy. The enemy is them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, baseball woke up and recognized there was an 800-pound
gorilla sitting in our living room,'' said San Diego Padres
president Larry Lucchino of the resolution that calls for Selig to
``take such action as he deems appropriate to ensure an appropriate
level of long-term competitive balance. Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has been for too long a big, old oil transport ship
that takes forever to turn. Bud should take the rudder and turn as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig declined to say what he was going to do. Actually, the
overhaul of Central Baseball has aleady started. Offices of the
American and National leagues have already been eliminated. AL
president Gene Budig has been reassigned as a special assistant to
the commissioner. NL president Len Coleman resigned, protesting
among other things that Selig had phased out the highest ranking
minority in organized baseball without a visible replacement and
that not even recent hirings could make up for the lack of
diversity at baseball's highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   The new best interests clause says Selig ``without limitation''
has the right to ensure ``there is an appropriate level of
long-term competitive balance among the clubs.'' He can use that to
override all of baseball's rules, including the one requiring
three-quarters approval for revenue sharing.

NOT A GAME FOR OUR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   How easily we pontificate about family values. How easily
children become footballs for political Punt, Pass, and Kick.
</P>
<P>
   In Pontiac, Mich., a judge last week sentenced Nathaniel Abraham
to seven years in a maximum-security juvenile facility. Abraham was
the youngest person ever convicted as an adult for a murder he
committed when he was 11. The judge, Eugene Arthur Moore, could
have fashioned a sentence that would send Abraham to adult prison
at 21.
</P>
<P>
   Moore refused, saying that society has gone too far in punishing
children. Michigan passed a law three years ago allowing a child of
any age to be tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to see incarceration as a long-term
solution,'' Moore said in his decision. ``He is a boy who has been
neglected by his home, our community, and our juvenile justice
system. He represents our collective failings. . . . I urge the
Legislature to lean toward improving the resources and programs
within the juvenile justice system rather than diverting more youth
into an already failed adult system.''
</P>
<P>
   This did not stop Governor John Engler from defending trying
small children as adults, even when it was clear that Abraham, of a
mental age much younger than his current 13, barely understood the
gravity of his act. Engler spokeswoman Susan Shafer said, ``He
thinks it's a good law.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Florida, there is the highly publicized case of Elian
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who survived the capsizing of a
boat two months ago that was attempting to escape from Cuba to the
United States. His mother died in the accident. Elian was rescued
and placed with relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has a father in Cuba who wants him back. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service ruled that the boy should go back. But
the relatives, from the politically powerful Cuban-American
community of south Florida which hates Cuban President Fidel
Castro, say they are keeping the child and have turned the battle
over Elian into capitalism vs. communism, freedom vs. the INS,
thought-control vs. ice cream, and Havana vs. Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Senator Connie Mack wants Congress to grant the child
instant US citizenship, a move that has the full support of Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay and
the probable support of House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The case is now presidential politics. No major contender _
George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore, nor Bill Bradley _ has had
the courage to flatly say the boy should be promptly sent back to
his father. They all have punted the child, passed him into limbo,
and kicked the father to the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush and McCain blasted the INS. Gore said the father
should come to the United States to plead for his boy. Bradley has
flip-flopped, saying, ``I thought Elian Gonzalez should stay in the
United States, but I'm not going to second guess the INS.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton this week said, ``We need to think long and
hard'' whether Elian should not be sent back to his father, even
``if we don't like the government of the country where the people
lived.'' But the anti-Castro lobby has made him think so long and
hard, it now appears that instead of sending Elian home soon, he
will let the case be drawn out in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   This all adds up to a political arena that cannot get it
straight about ``family values.'' In Michigan, everyone concerned
with the Abraham case laments the fact that the boy never knew his
father, who left the family before his birth. In an interview last
fall on ``60 Minutes,'' Nathaniel Abraham said his father's absence
``makes me mad sometimes, too. . . . cause it just, leaving my mama
there all by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people want to blockade the father of Elian Gonzalez
for political points, points that contradict their own claims about
the importance of fathers. Bush complains about ``children
abandoned by fathers.'' McCain said, ``We are not parenting our
children.'' Bradley said part of reducing poverty is ``fathers
realizing that having a child is a lifetime commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said, ``the father must have a central role in his
children's lives. . . . children growing up without a father are
more likely to do poorly in school, get pregnant, do drugs, and
have a hard time finding and keeping a job. On the positive side, a
father's involvement, even in a broken family, has a very positive
impact on the children.''
</P>
<P>
   If all these politicians really believe in this ``central
role,'' Elian Gonzalez would be home now. Fathers of children like
Nathaniel Abraham would be held more accountable for parenting and
child support. We would end this bizzare fantasy that ice cream
cones, trips to Disney, and US citizenship are a substitute for a
father after a mother has died.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Abraham's fatherless world has already crashed. The
reality of loss will soon come crashing down on Elian Gonzalez.
Soon, he will feel punted, passed around, and kicked in his soul.
The person who should be waiting to catch him are not some
well-meaning but barely familiar relatives. It should be the
father.

`SAINTS' A SMART, PROFANE TRIP INTO HYPERVIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Boondock Saints 
Written by: Troy Duffy 
Directed by:Troy Duffy 
Starring: Willem Dafoe, Norman Reedus, and Sean Patrick Flanery 
Running Time: 108 minutes 
Rated: NC-17 (for extreme violence and profanity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Troy Duffy witnessed one too many violent crimes. So he did what
any self-respecting 26-year-old aspiring musician struggling to
survive in LA would do: He wrote a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the result is ``Boondock Saints,'' a ``Pulp
Fiction''-style revenge fantasy that follows two vigilante Irish
Catholic brothers in Boston as they embark on a mission from God to
rid their city of evil. The question at the center of the film
isn't exactly novel: What's more important, to do good or do right?
Duffy, a Boston native, assumes (and he's right) that there are few
among us _ even the most civil and humane creatures _ who haven't
thought, upon hearing of a particularly heinous act, that the world
would be a better place _ a godlier place _ if someone just took
out out the toxic slice of human waste. Wouldn't it, on a level
vastly more profound than due process, be a service to mankind? Not
to mention divine justice?
</P>
<P>
   Connor and Murphy McManus believe it with fanatical fervor. The
story opens at morning Mass in a Boston chuch, where the McManus
brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, respectively) are
soaking in a sermon describing the most fearsome evil of all: the
indifference of good men. The priest's point is well taken, as
evidenced by the brothers' enthusiastic beating that night of
Russian thugs who are trying to close down the neighborhood bar.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe), a dashing and gifted FBI
agent who is called in to investigate the grotesque murder of the
two Russians. We haven't seen the grisly slayings yet (involving a
toilet and a slo-mo leap off of a building), and won't until after
Smecker and his bumbling team of cops analyze and theorize about
what has happened. This device is used throughout the film, as the
McManus brothers and their honorary brother-in-arms Rocco
systematically select sleazebags to knock off in ritualistic
sessions that include Latin prayers and pennies over the eyes.
Smecker unravels evidence at the crime scene, after which the film
flashes back to show the killings as they happened. As Smecker gets
closer and closer to discovering the killers (who have become
heroes in the community), the investigations and flashbacks are cut
closer, until finally the crime and investigation scenes merge _
quite beautifully _ with Smecker miming the killers' moves
alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy's a novice, albeit a talented one, and sometimes the line
between cool invention and indulgent whimsy is fuzzy. A gay
detective who listens to opera at crime scenes while he glides and
swished down alleyways interpreting clues is one example. Another
is the notion of brothers who work days at a meatpacking plant,
spend nights in barroom brawls, and yet somehow are masters of five
languages, any number of which they conveniently break into for
private conversations. Plus, there are a couple of left-field plot
twists that jettison the story even deeper into never-never land.
</P>
<P>
   But cinema verite isn't the objective here. Sheer entertainment
value triumphs over Duffy's flights of character and plot
development, which aren't always structurally sound. Duffy, who
directed the film as well, takes a smart, fast, incredibly violent
and profane look (hello, NC-17) into the dark heart of the moral
dilemma. He navigates the twisted collision of religious faith and
the thrill of the kill, altruism and brutality, with an ingenious
mix of humor, horror, mysticism, and just plain hipness. It's our
very own sick fantasy on a Hollywood platter.

PROMISING `THIRD MIRACLE' FAILS THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE THIRD MIRACLE 
Directed by: Agnieszka Holland 
Screenplay by: John Romano, Richard Vitere (novel: Vitere) 
Starring: Ed Harris, Anne Heche, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Ken James,
James Gallanders, Catrina Scorsone, Michael Rispoli, Charles Haid,
Jade Smith, Norma Dell'Agnese, Barbara Sukowa 
Running time: 119 minutes 
Rated: R (some language, sex-related and violent images, and brief
drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No American actor embodies blue-collar life as convincingly as
Ed Harris, even when he's wearing a Roman collar as a priest in
``The Third Miracle.'' The story takes place in Chicago, and
Harris's priest, undergoing a crisis of faith, is living as a lay
person at something just above the flophouse level. Put Harris in
any working man's role _ NASA supervisor in ``Apollo 13,'' undersea
engineer in ``The Abyss,'' cutthroat salesman in ``Glengarry Glen
Ross,'' cop as working stiff in ``China Moon,'' and he's instantly
convincing as a guy who makes his living working with his hands,
his nerve endings, and the connection of both to his intelligence
and experience. Walking down a gritty Chicago street in the shadow
of the el, Harris persuades us that he has the environment in his
blood and bones.
</P>
<P>
   Where he doesn't look at home is in the archbishop's mansion,
where he is summoned because he also happens to be a terrific
investigator, and the Archdiocese needs some quality detective
work. A local woman who emigrated from a Slovakian village after a
mysterious wartime occurrence in 1944, and had lived in Chicago
until her death, is credited with causing miraculous cures and
inexplicable phenomena. She's being pushed for sainthood. The
Church, cautious in such matters, asks Harris, with piquant irony,
to rally his faith while assuming the role of professional skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   Director Agnieszka Holland and her cinematographer, Jerry
Zielinski, do a good job of capturing the raw plainness of
Chicago's working-class neighborhoods. But neither their
contributions nor Harris's sterling performance can carry ``The
Third Miracle'' past a muddle-headed inability to make its focus on
faith and belief work in dramatic terms. The first half is
shapeless. Then when the film does take shape, it does so
wrongheadedly. Things begin to come together in one sense and fall
apart in another when the priest meets the embittered grown
daughter of the woman in question. The candidate was no saint in
the eyes of her daughter Roxanna, played by Anne Heche, a
resourceful actress who isn't given a character of much dimension
to portray. Roxanna doesn't so much exist in her own right as seem
an ambulatory device to illustrate the point that the priest is
very much rooted in this world, as we see when a relationship
between them is enkindled.
</P>
<P>
   Harris convinces as a man both virile and troubled, but when the
film means to escalate the drama, he and ``The Third Miracle''
implode. The title, by the way, refers to one of the requirements
for sainthood. A proposed candidate must satisfy investigators that
he or she caused three miracles (the number has been reduced to two
since the story was written). Additionally, a squad of
Vatican-based European clerics arrives in Chicago to deliberate the
prospective sainthood. When Harris's plain-spoken postulator
clashes with Armin-Mueller Stahl's naysayer, the idea is to build
drama. But only Mueller-Stahl's skill keeps the film from cracking
apart on the clumsiness of the arrogant European caricature with
which he's saddled. In short, ``The Third Miracle'' takes on
provocative and stimulating subject matter, but can't bring it into
satisfying dramatic focus, stranding three strong actors who are
superior to their material.

TITANS' GEORGE LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher was feeling nostalgic, with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Just before warmups last Sunday at Indianapolis's RCA Dome,
where the Titans were supposed to meet their demise in an AFC
divisional playoff against the Colts, the Tennessee coach
approached his muscle magazine running back, Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those days of yore, Fisher recollected fondly, back in
1996 when the Titans _ then the Houston Oilers _ played leapfrog in
the draft order, moving down and then up and trading a player in
the process, just so they could land the Heisman Trophy winner from
Ohio State with the No. 14 pick?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, George remembered. Ah, auld lang syne. ``It was a special
moment,'' he recalled. ``I almost cried _ no, just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Fisher wasn't. Tender memories quickly gave way to the
decidedly unsentimental point of this reverie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we did it,'' he told George. ``For you to win
games like this for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for warm and fuzzy. Fair enough, figured George.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fisher) was challenging me,'' he said. ``I nodded my head and
said to myself, `OK, he's right. This is why they drafted me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And this is why the high-powered Colts are extinct while the
Titans are in position to make franchise history. Realizing the
dividends of those draft day machinations four springs ago, George
sundered Indianapolis for a franchise playoff record of 162 yards
on 26 carries, including a 68-yard third-quarter touchdown burst up
the gut and down the throat of the Colts defense, springing
Tennessee to a comeback 19-16 upset.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Titans, presumed to be the beggars at this banquet,
will be in Jacksonville Sunday to face their Central neighbors, the
Jaguars, for the AFC title. If they can beat the division champions
for the third time in as many meetings this season, the Titans will
become the last members of the AFL freshman class of 1960 to gain
entry to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher wasn't just spreading inspirational fertilizer;
they'd be nowhere without George. At 6 feet 3 inches, 240 pounds,
he is the bulwark _ some would say the extent _ of the Tennessee
offense. He is one of only four runners in NFL history _ along with
Eric Dickerson, Earl Campbell, and Barry Sanders _ to gain at least
1,200 yards in each of his first four seasons. And he did so
through some less than halcyon days _ from the Oilers' final year
in Houston to their orphaned wanderings through Tennessee, first in
Memphis and then at Vanderbilt University before they acquired a
permanent Nashville address, Aedlphia Stadium, this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my rookie year coming home to Houston from a road
trip,'' said George. ``There were two people there playing the
Oiler fight song to meet us. I thought, `Oh, man, we got a long way
to go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps as a result, they retarded the recognition factor
for their lone reason to brag consistently. For the first three
years of George's career, the Titans were the very definitions of
mediocrity _ 8-8 each time _ before this season's breakout 13-3
performance, which many skeptics attributed more to a tapioca
schedule than Tennessee's might. And while George received his due
from the football literati, as evidenced by Pro Bowl selections
each of the last three years, it seemed he never was the people's
choice. While he poked and prodded and powered for yardage with
little in the way of a supporting cast, he was generally an
afterthought behind Terrell Davis or Sanders or one-year phenoms
such as Jamal Anderson or this year's rookie darling, NFL rushing
champion Edgerrin James _ whom he outgained on one carry Sunday as
the Colt ace was being throttled by Tennessee's defense, squeaking
out 56 yards on 20 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, George is as unassuming as his team's pedigree. So
he resisted the opportunity to gloat about seizing Sunday's
showcase or to lament the lack of fanfare he has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgerrin James is a great back,'' he said. ``And the situation
we've been under the last three years didn't allow me to be
recognized. We weren't in the playoffs. We were a lame-duck team.
Terrell Davis was getting 2,000 yards, Barry Sanders was _ with me
getting my 1,300, I can understand why the attention was on them.
Maybe next year will be my time to make headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have expedited the timetable. Coupled with his 29-carry,
106-yard output in a wild-card victory over Buffalo, Sunday's
splash made George the first Oiler/Titan to gain 100 yards in
consecutive postseason games. And his touchdown run, another
franchise record, left him so alone in the spotlight that he had to
double-check to make sure he wasn't hallucinating.
</P>
<P>
   As George outraced a posse of Colts while putting the Titans
ahead for the first and last time, 13-9, he looked up at the end
zone video screen, just to be certain this was really happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell myself, `OK, just look straight ahead,' '' he
recalled. ``I didn't want to get a turf monster or fall down. I've
never looked at the screen like that before. I didn't have any long
runs like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what he's done with all those short runs _ unflinchingly,
unfailingly _ that truly gets Fisher a bit misty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about our philosophy to run the football,'' said
the coach. ``To run when you're not supposed to run. To run when
everyone knows you're going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Eddie George did against the Colts. Not just for old times'
sake. For the future of a franchise.

IN NEW ZEALAND, IT'S TROUT HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAUOPO, New Zealand _ Until you see them _ actually feast your
eyes _ you remain skeptical. Even with all the literature you may
have read about the legendary trout fishing in this mountainous
island nation, nothing quite prepares you for the sight of half a
dozen brown trout, 8 pounds and up, feeding in a stream so gin
clear you can count the speckles on their sides.
</P>
<P>
   We had made our way off a heaving tract through high grass in
the morning, down through dense bush to a ledge about 20 feet over
the Taharua River. A stretch about 50 yards long lay before us, the
clear 3-foot-deep water moving swiftly out of the woods to our left
and breaking into riffles at the bend down to our right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there,'' said Simon Dickie, our guide, pointing down.
``There's one. Quite a big fellow there. And here are two more
right under us here. I count six, seven fish here now.''
</P>
<P>
   We _ my fishing companions, Angus Phillips and Daniel Forester,
Dickie, and I _ were at a piece of the Taharua called ``Guides'
Beat.'' Dickie began the morning with some instruction in the art
of seeing the fish, which was not hard. With the sun full on the
stream, looking down with polarized glasses that cut the water's
glare, the trout were dark gray torpedoes in the green water.
</P>
<P>
   Most faced upstream, holding in the fast-moving water and rising
to feed on insects floating down over them, mainly caddis. Now and
then one would chase another around in an eliptical circle, then
end up roughly back where the two had started. But generally they
held ``on station,'' as Dickie said, using the New Zealand term for
fish holding a feeding spot for hours.
</P>
<P>
   This was not trout fishing in the ordinary sense, but trout
hunting or stalking. Dickie instructed Forester and me to keep
watch on a very large brown holding just above a rock downstream.
He and Phillips would work their way down to the stream bed,
stealthily get into position to cast a nymph upstream of the
holding fish, and let it drift down to the trout.
</P>
<P>
   The trick with these trout, Dickie explained, was to get your
fly in place with a presentation so subtle that they don't sense
the line in the water. Once spooked, the fish do not necessarily
take off, but become indifferent. You could land a thousand flies
directly in front of its snout and the spooked fish wouldn't budge
toward it.
</P>
<P>
   So after a day's fishing on a stretch of river, called a
``beat,'' each with a name, that beat is ``rested'' for one or two
weeks before anglers touch the water there again.
</P>
<P>
   What now seemed a smorgasbord of huge trout lying before us was
going to be tougher to fish than it looked, Dickie noted. ``This is
actually a very difficult piece of water,'' he said. ``You frighten
one of those fish and it in turn frightens another one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is called ``one-cast fishing'' here. Rather than standing in
the stream casting for hour after hour, searching for what might be
promising holes, riffles, or undercut banks, trout fishing here is
like bone fishing. Find the target, cast, and wait to strike at the
slightest movement of the indicator _ a small ball of white
balsamic rock tied at the joint of the line and tippet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is no virtue in this kind of fishing,'' said Dickie.
``The least hesitation and the fish will spit that hook and you'll
never get it on again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Poronui Ranch, a 20,000-acre spread of remote high country
in New Zealand's fabled Lake Taupo region, lies nestled in a valley
between Kaimanawa Range National Park and Kawekas Mountains, and
backs up to half a million acres of Mauri land with no access
except by helicopter. Throughout this land, the five guides take
anglers to remote streams to which only Poronui guests have access.
The streams and rivers are never fished by more than two or three
anglers and a guide, and rarely is one beat fished more frequently
than once in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dickie, along with a few partners, owns this spread and is
pursuing a dream of making it an international sporting mecca for
an extremely restricted number of guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to establish a world-class recreational
retreat,'' says Dickie, who won Olympic gold medals in 1968 and
1972 as coxswain for New Zealand rowing teams. ``We've got the land
here surrounded by mountains. We have 40 beats on trout streams _
all private water. (By next year), we'll have a string of horses,
mountains bikes. We'll build cabins up in the mountains so people
can go out with a guide, ride for a day, stay at a cabin in the
woods, and ride back next day. But we want it to always retain its
wild character.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the ranch is year-round deer, turkey, and upland game
hunting, all guided.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart or Poranui Ranch is a central dining lodge
surrounded by sleeping cabins and suites for 10 guests. On the deck
outside the main lodge, high above the rushing Tapahura River,
where anglers swap tales of the day _ no need to exaggerate in
these parts _ Eve Riley, the manager and chef, prepares dinners of
range venison, chicken, beef, and lamb.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Dickie drove us deep into the bush to the
stretch called Guide's Beat because it is a preferred piece of
water held in reserve for wild-trout-starved sportsmen from Europe
and the United States who take refuge at Poranui Ranch land from
overfished waters back home.
</P>
<P>
   Here, moving slowly up stream ``sighting'' fish before casting,
wading stealthily so as not to set up vibrations that might spook
fish _ one angler at a time tries his luck and skill.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips gets a cast over the first fish, but it heard us coming
and ignored his offering of a (NU)14 Beadhead Caddis. We waded
upstream a bit to his second sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Now waist deep in the chasm river, with verdant mountain peaks
rising a couple of thousand feet overhead, we had grown hot. Dickie
scooped river water to drink, a health hazard in most places in the
world. ``Not here,'' he said. ``It's pure water. You can drink
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next cast produced the prize of the day. Phillips hooked up
to an 8-pound brown that fought up and down the river, winding off
the line, whose breaking point, Dickie pointed out, was far weaker
than the weight and power of the fish. ``Keep the tip up,'' he
instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the trout was netted and brought up for
inspection. To New England eyes, the proportions didn't quite
compute, though it looked in every way but size a beautifully
marked brown trout _ color on the bright golden side, speckles dark
black on its sides and across its 5-inch-wide back. Dickie weighed
the fish, lowered it lovingly, and watched it zoom off at full
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was a picnic at a culler's camp _ a vestigal bunkhouse out
in the bush once used by professional red deer hunters who took
venison by pack animal from the big herds they worked on back to
market. Today most venison is farm-raised in New Zealand, though
deer hunting is still popular.
</P>
<P>
   Riley met us at the camp with lunch, and a toast of chardonnay
from the local vineyards, chilled of course. We toasted Phillips's
terrific catch, but the day was only half over, and a bit later
news was already getting back from an even more remote stream where
another guest, Greg Kelly, helicoptered in that morning and caught
a 10-pound rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Kelly, a lifelong fly fisherman who has seen the
world's finest trout water, pronounced Poronui ``the best fly
fishing I've ever seen.'' The legendary New Zealand trout had stood
up well.

IS FLINT DRYING UP UMASS' CASH COW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speculation about Bruiser Flint's future at the University
of Massachusetts has been the subject du jour in Amherst. Most of
it centers around the topic of wins and losses, with the consensus
being that for Flint to have any kind of job security, the
Minutemen must at the very least qualify for the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another issue here. Money. Not salaries, but the
amount the program brings to the UMass athletic department. UMass
basketball is the Minutemen's cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing comes close in generating revenue. The more the
Minutemen win, the more they are on television. The more they can
get into the NCAA tournament and earn money for the school and the
Atlantic 10, the healthier the athletic department's fiscal
situation.
</P>
<P>
   How does the budget stand now? Well, consider that the UMass
football team won the Division 1AA national championship last
season and the program finished a couple of million dollars in the
red.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to basketball and Flint. The value is not
in winning, but in how well the program entertains. Crowds at the
Mullins Center have been down for a couple of years. They are down
dramatically this season. Word has it that the actual in-house
crowd for a home game (and loss) to St. Bonaventure a couple of
weeks ago was under 4,000. Season-ticket sales are down 1,200 from
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Although the Mullins Center is in the heart of the
UMass campus, the school has to pay rent each time it uses the
building for games and practices _ $11,000 per game, $600 per
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So it stings when 3,500 people, instead of 8,000, show up for a
basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of John Calipari at UMass was that he made the
program nationally known. Anywhere, anytime was his motto, and it
worked. You can argue whether it was worth the price of all the
things that evolved during Calipari's reign, specifically the
Marcus Camby case, but the bottom line was there was a sense of
excitement surrounding UMass basketball. It was something special.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't anymore, and that is what is putting Flint's coaching
career in Amherst in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those little Devils
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People had better start paying attention to Duke again. After
losing their first two games of the season, the Devils were tossed
into the discard pile of national contenders, but they haven't lost
since. Even more remarkable was that with their victory over N.C.
State Wednesday, they tied the all-time ACC consecutive game
winning streak of 27 (set by N.C. State from 1972-75). The Devils'
last conference loss was on Feb. 5, 1998, quite an accomplishment
in a conference as tough as the ACC. ``What Duke has accomplished
certainly entitles them to proclaim they are among the best
programs in the country in modern basketball history,'' said N.C.
State coach Herb Sendek. ``They have been able to maintain it over
time with a few speed bumps along the way.'' Said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski: ``I have been in this league for 209 years and I know
how precious an ACC win is. Any kind of streak, whether it be two
or what, we feel real fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things heating up
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's mid-January and you know the teams are playing conference
games. Why? Coaches are sniping at officials. It got so bad over
the past few weeks in the Big East that commissioner Mike Tranghese
had to send out a memo warning all coaches to keep their lips
sealed when it came to criticizing officials. ``I've written
basically the same letter each of the last three years,'' said
Tranghese. ``Things just get more intense when you get into
conference play.'' . . . The issue of opportunities for
African-Americans in the college administrative ranks, which came
to the forefront with a threatened boycott six years ago, is still
simmering. College basketball programs, in which 60 percent of the
players are black and 30 percent of the coaches and assistant
coaches are black, are still very light in the administrative
departments . . . St. John's, which came within a heartbeat of
making the Final Four a year ago, is back at it again with a 12-3
record. The Red Storm, who scored a stunning victory over defending
national champion UConn in Storrs Sunday, will host Ohio State (and
former BC coach Jim O'Brien and former BC player Scoonie Penn) at
Madison Square Garden Saturday afternoon. The amazing part is that
Mark Jarvis, St. John's coach, is winning games with a seven-man
rotation and not a great deal of size . . . What's going on at
North Carolina? The mighty Tar Heels look like just an average team
now, beatable on any given Sunday, Thursday, or any day . . .
Northwestern is once again the doormat of the Big Ten. Why? Lots of
reasons, but youth is the biggest one. ``We're starting four
freshmen now,'' said Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill. ``And
they're probably not the same kind of freshmen that Duke or
Carolina get, so we're struggling a little.'' . . . One of the
turnarounds of the year next to Boston College is Duquesne. The
Dukes were 5-23 a year ago but upset Xavier last week and have
already won eight games. They didn't post their fifth win last
season until Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wha'd he say?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK. Explain Bob Knight to me. His postgame remarks and attitude
about former player Steve Alford's return to Bloomington as coach
of the Iowa Hawkeyes mystifies even those who know him well. Alford
is as Indiana as you come and came back to cheers in what turned
out to to be a tough 5-point loss. He was classy and gracious in
defeat. Knight was not the same in victory. Why coaches or anyone
has to act that way defies explanation . . . Supposedly Knight had
issues with a book that Alford did and with former IU player Luke
Recker, who eventually wound up at Iowa, where he is redshirting
this season; but Knight, who has a network of former players and
assistants who have become coaches, seems to go out of his way to
break off some relationships, which is as sad as it is puzzling . .
. Most bizarre incident of the season happened Sunday night in
Lubbock, Texas, following a controversial 88-86 victory by Texas
A&AMP;M over Texas Tech, in which a last-second basket by A&AMP;M was ruled
good, not good, and then good again. The game ended and Texas A&AMP;M
left the court, while Tech stayed on the court for an additional 45
minutes debating whether time had expired. Two officials ruled the
shot should not have counted and the game should have gone into
overtime, but a third said it was good, and his ruling prevailed.
The result? A&AMP;M won the game, but the official who made the call,
Charles Range, was suspended for the rest of the season by the Big
12. ``Referee Charles Range failed to follow appropriate protocol
in the postgame situation,'' said Big 12 commissioner Kevin
Weiberg. ``Officials make judgment errors and that is not in and of
itself grounds for disciplinary action. However, the failure to
follow proper protocol and game administration is inappropriate and
compels further action on the part of the conference.'' . . .
Strange occurrence at Tuesday night's BC-Georgetown game at Conte
Forum _ genuine noise in support of the Eagles. Far too often, the
place has been quieter than a morgue, but although the place was
still one-third empty, the Eagles actually had some fan support you
could hear and feel.

TODD COLLINS: STILL RAM TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ The New England bond is still there.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the Rams' Todd Collins spot a familiar face from
New England when he blurted out, ``Ted Johnson came in Sunday
morning . . . he went to the game . . . and Ted and his wife just
left.'' First words.
</P>
<P>
   For three days, the two linebackers who were so close in New
England got even closer here in America's heartland. Johnson and
his wife stayed at the home of Collins and his wife, Jill. Johnson
told Collins ``of the circus back in New England'' and Collins told
Johnson about his Rams, of how he realized maybe three games into
the season that St. Louis was not only an improving team, but a
very good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah . . . it was good for Ted to come in and visit . . .
we're so good friends. It was so good he got to come in and see the
game (last Sunday against Minnesota),'' Collins kept on. ``And it
was so good for Ted to stay at our house the last few days. It was
such a good visit.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been more than a few mysterious moves during the Pete
Carroll-Bobby Grier regime in New England, but letting Todd Collins
slip into the free agent marketplace last February to be wooed by
Oakland, the New York Giants, and the Rams ranks with the more
questionable moves that have reduced the Patriots to a mediocre
.500 team.
</P>
<P>
   Collins finally decided on the Rams based on money, of course,
but also because Charley Armey, the Rams' vice president for
personnel, was doing the wooing. And when Collins brought Johnson
into the Rams' practice facility Monday morning, the two quickly
made a beeline upstairs to the office of Armey, the former director
of college scouting for New England.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Armey ``was the one who brought me and Ted to New
England,'' reminded Collins. Charley's such a good guy and Ted
likes him as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, for his part, regards Collins ``like a son. Not just
because he is such a good player, but because he's such a good
person. I made it a priority to get Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey had first located Collins in the 1993 draft. Collins had
enrolled at Tennessee, but many in football lost track of him when
Collins transferred from Knoxville to much-smaller Carson-Newman
College. ``A lot of people don't know that Todd has a 34-inch
vertical leap,'' said Armey. ``He's an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   So Armey was surprised and pleased during this season when he
got a call from the locker room and was asked to come on down. A
load of pizzas had arrived for Collins, and Collins wanted Armey to
share in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Ted (Johnson) and all the guys up in New England,''
said Collins. ``They called a pizza place here and had 'em
delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on a Patriot tradition. Each Friday, the Patriots eat
pizza after practice ``and the (Patriot) linebackers wanted to let
Todd know he wasn't forgotten,'' said Armey. ``So they sent pizzas
over to Todd. And Todd wanted me to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was last Monday. When Collins brought Johnson up to
meet Armey, ``Ted wanted to have a picture taken of the three of us
together,'' said Armey. ``That was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, Collins one moment talking about the Rams, the next
inquiring about the Patriots. ``What are they going to do?'' asked
the Rams linebacker. ``Get (Bill) Belichick? Is Belichick coming?''
</P>
<P>
   And it went as it always has with Todd Collins, a football
player who defines the word ``solid,'' but one who seldom, if ever,
wants any attention. The national media have descended upon the
Rams and videocams are by every locker, but Collins was as hard to
find this week as last.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' said Collins. ``I always like being overlooked. I
mean, that's me. Let somebody else have the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Collins finally was located and he excitedly talked about
the Rams and how he has made the difficult switch from an outside
linebcker who usually played on the left side in New England to one
who always plays on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   And if the casual football fan is entranced by the Rams'
offense, and how points so quickly add up, others think back to the
first quarter of last Sunday's game against the Vikings when Jeff
George threw a screen pass to Robert Smith on a third down and
Smith turned upfield with three blockers in front of him only to
have Collins plow through two of the blockers, and stop Smith short
of a first down. St. Louis also has a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awww ...,'' said Collins, ever humble in his ever-present
Eastern Tennessee drawl, ``it was nothing. I just got through some
guys. You just do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   But his new position is something.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit more mental work here than we had in New
England,'' said Collins of his switch to the right side. ``It's a
bit more complicated. In New England, I flip-flopped with
(linebacker Chris) Slade playing opposite the tight end but now I'd
had to learn how to play (opposite) the tight end. That's something
new after eight years. Now I've had to learn to do whatever. Nnow
it's more of a total outside linebacker position whereas in New
England, it's still called an outside linebacker position, but you
still play a lot of the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said this joyful seson in St. Louis ``has been
unbelievable, and while I might like to think I had a crystal ball,
I didn't. I like to think things work out in this life for a reason
and there's a reason why it was time for me to move on from New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on St. Louis, Collins explained, ``I knew that
(fellow linebacker and ex-Patriot) Ray Agnew was here, and I knew
that (defensive lineman and ex-Patriot) Mike Jones was here (in
1998), and he and I talked and Mike had made the statement that he
liked it here in St. Louis and his wife talked to my wife and said
she really enjoyed it here in St. Louis. And they had a lot of good
things to say about Coach (Dick) Vermeil and this whole
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But another factor was the location (``It's about half the
driving time from here to my home in eastern Tennessee opposed to
Boston'') and a huge factor was Armey. Collins didn't want to leave
New England, saying ``I loved Boston and I spent my whole career
there, and I'd love to go back and visit.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked why the Patriots let him slip away, Collins began
his reply by saying, ``The only thing that bothered me was the
Patriots never called me or anything. I always thought I had done
my job and done it quietly, like they like, for seven years. That's
the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Collins stepped out of his character for an instant; a
man who never criticizes anyone said he was perplexed why the
Patriots under Grier and Carroll let so many ``good people'' go.
Not only good football players, but more importantly, men of good
character, of which Collins certainly was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing . . . over the years letting guys go,
passing up good people,'' said Collins of the Sam Gashes, Curtis
Martins, and the others. ``That's the only thing suspect. That's
just proven to me, you win with good guys. It's like that here.
They have good guys here. You win with good people who are good
players, too. But it was the Patriots' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he suspected late in the 1998 season ``when I got
hurt that I might be gone,'' he went on. ``I told my wife I might
not be back. I said, `We probably won't be here next year,' because
I've been around long enough to know how this business is. You
can't take it personal. It's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins believes that neither Carroll nor his linebacker coach
``wanted me to go, and I don't think it was their decision. I guess
Bobby Grier made a decision above them. It was (the organization's)
decision because the coaches wanted me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Patriot mistake. But now Todd Collins is on a team
that will very likely go to the Super Bowl, Collins's second in
four years, and he is a happy man.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Collins leaves the field when nickel and dime
defensive packages are sent in (of which there were many occasions
this season since St. Louis's opponents so often were behind and
forced to pass), he was one of the team's leading tacklers. But in
Sunday's game he will be sure to be noticed since Tampa Bay loves
to run the ball and Collins will be meeting up with the Bucs' Mike
Alstott many a time.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation ends just as it had begun. About the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Collins mentions yet another ``good person'' on the Patriots,
his close friend Johnson, and the St. Louis linebacker talked about
the New England problems at linebacker this season after Johnson
got hurt in camp, about the domino effect that left rookie Andy
Katzenmoyer at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Then Collins said, ``I think Teddy might be gone, too, when
Teddy's contract's up. I mean, I can see it. I've been around. It
comes down to if they want to keep you, they'll keep you, and if
they don't, they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   And Todd Collins is the prime example of that.

PEROT TO THE RESCUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ross Perot may well be a crank best suited to wrestling with
other cranks like Jesse Ventura, but he could yet turn out to be a
part of the solution to putting Harvard Pilgrim Health Care back
together.
</P>
<P>
   As grim as the news is on Harvard Pilgrim, the pieces are
beginning to be assembled that could save the state's oldest and
largest health maintenance organization. I am told that Perot is
among those who want to play.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has much at stake here. Harvard Pilgrim's boss, Charlie
Baker, hired Dallas-based Perot Systems Corp. this fall to handle
the HMO's computer systems, which have been faulted for leaving the
company in the dark about its real costs and real revenues. The
Perot contract is worth $700 million over 10 years; Perot has 900
people here working on the Harvard account.
</P>
<P>
   With Harvard Pilgrim melting down, Perot flew into town Jan. 7
to reassure the troops. In a meeting with Baker that day and in
subsequent conversations, Perot and Harvard Pilgrim have discussed
a number of ways Perot could help, including a loan to help
recapitalize the big insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot deal by itself would not save Harvard Pilgrim. But a
Perot loan, and assistance from the hospitals, could provide
Harvard Pilgrim the capital it needs to revive a state bond deal to
sell Harvard's health centers. That sale, which died when Harvard
was forced into receivership, would have raised $120 million for
Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for Perot to pitch in. In 1992, when Blue
Cross and Blue Shield was in its first big mess, the insurer
brought in Electronic Data Systems, which was then owned by General
Motors but had been founded by Perot, to run its computer systems.
Like Harvard Pilgrim, Blue Cross signed a long-term contract with
its new vendor. But it also got an $80 million note from EDS, which
recognized the money Blue Cross poured into its infamous System 21
computers. Blue Cross was able to use the $80 million note to
bolster its reserves and paid for the loan through increased annual
administrative fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot discussions are preliminary; he could still choose to
do nothing. The investment bank hired by the state to look at
options, Salomon Smith Barney, is just getting started. A Harvard
Pilgrim spokesman referred questions to the state receiver; a Perot
spokesman didn't return my call. State Attorney General Thomas
Reilly also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   These are forever my favorite stories: the ones where no one
will say anything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, but nobody, raises money like Our President. Millions
for the party. Millions for the vice president. Millions for the
first lady. And then there's his own legacy to fund.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the really exclusive invitation when President
Clinton was here on Tuesday was that $25,000-a-couple party at Alan
Solomont's house in Weston? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   The real intimate get-together happened that afternoon in the
president's suite at the Boston Park Plaza when he met with five of
his deepest-pocketed friends about raising money for his planned
presidential library in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Five: Solomont, a health-care entrepreneur; Jack
Manning, president of Boston Capital (a real estate finance firm,
not the column); James Daley, former owner of the Copley Plaza
Hotel; Howard Kessler, who heads Kessler Financial Services; and
Fred Seigel, a former executive with Energy Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is trying to raise $125 million for his library. The
talk was about ``the vision''; no checks were written at Tuesday's
meeting, say those who were there. But Terry McAullife, the
president's ``first pal'' and chief fund-raiser, was also there,
and I expect the five will be hearing back from him shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's library is to include a first in presidential
libraries: an apartment for the president. I wonder if there will
be a spare bedroom for big donors?

ECONOMISTS SEE MORE FED RATE HIKES ON THE HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about everyone on Wall Street is prepared for the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates in early February to slow the
economy down. Most investors also expect at least one more rate
hike by spring.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of economists think the Fed may wind up
dispensing more doses of bitter medicine than the market is
expecting. These economists already have three rate hikes in their
forecasts for 2000 and they won't rule out the possibility of more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a rather substantial increase in rates to dent the
euphoria that is out there,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of
RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   If Zandi is right, investors who have thus far shrugged off the
Fed's actions may have reason to be worried. The stock market may
be able to handle the weight of a few rate hikes, but given enough
of them, stock prices could buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi's fear is based on some simple logic: The Federal Reserve
wants to see the economy slow down and so far, there is not the
slightest evidence that any slowdown is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the latest numbers suggest an economy that is barreling
ahead with a full head of steam. In its regular survey of economic
conditions, the Fed reported Wednesday that growth was strong
throughout the country and that labor shortages were commonplace.
The same day the government reported a big jump in housing
construction in December, despite the fact that mortgage rates have
climbed to an average 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the government said the trade deficit hit a record in
November, a reflection of this country's insatiable appetite for
foreign cars and consumer goods. Goldman Sachs now estimates the
economy grew at a 5.3 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter;
Goldman expects the economy to grow 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed, those numbers are the equivalent of cars traveling
80 miles per hour on a road where the speed limit is 55: Eventually
there is going to be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent speech, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan sounded a
mostly upbeat note about the economy. He praised the technological
changes that have allowed the US to grow strongly without
generating more inflation. ``There can be little argument that the
American economy as it stands at the beginning of a new century has
never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity,'' Greenspan declared.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the rest. Greenspan worried aloud about ``the
potential seeds'' of rising inflation and said there had to be
limits on how low the jobless rate could fall without triggering
rising wages and prices. The unemployment rate currently stands at
a microscopic 4.1 percent. Greenspan conceded there was no
inflation problem at the moment. Tomorrow may be another story.
</P>
<P>
   In the old economy, the three rate hikes the Fed enacted last
year might have been expected to show some results already. Not in
the new economy. Flexible mortgages allow homebuyers to avoid, or
at least postpone, some of the pain of higher rates. Generous
financing provided by automakers cushions car buyers in much the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   And in the hot new venture-backed companies, ``a percentage
point change in interest rates is a drop in the bucket,'' said Ed
McKelvey, an economist with Goldman Sachs. Echoing a widely held
view, McKelvey said the American economy is probably less sensitive
to changes in interest rates than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   So what does that mean for the Federal Reserve? If the Fed's old
club can't beat the economy down, does the central bank have to use
a bigger club _ even more rate hikes _ to have the impact it wants?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that will happen. They point out that
the Fed could run into some real political problems this year if it
tries to raise rates in the absence of any evidence of inflation.
The reaction may be: Why are you fighting a problem that doesn't
exist?
</P>
<P>
   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a New York
investment firm, mentions a second political problem: the
presidential campaign. ``The Fed would probably like to avoid being
in the political hot seat by raising rates during the campaign,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, however, Jones says that the Fed is facing a
different problem: a red-hot economy that needs to be cooled down.
He says the powerful stock market has made consumers wealthier and
more confident, which in turn has led them to spend more freely.
The result is an economy that is growing fast enough to create the
fear of inflation, if not much actual inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Jones expects the Fed to raise rates two or three
times this year. But he says more rate hikes are a possibility. ``I
don't think the odds favor that,'' he said, ``but the risks are
higher than most people in the stock market believe.''

TIGHTEN THE SCREW AND KEEP IT TIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The plate around the doorknob on one of my wood doors is
loose. The screw holes are so badly chewed up that the screws will
not hold. How can I tighten those screws?
</P>
<P>
   GUS SAUNDERS, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, try using bigger screws, but that may be risky
because bigger screws might not fit the holes in the doorknob
plate. An early repair was to fill the chewed-up hole with wood
matches, then drive the screws. It often works. A later fix is to
buy Mr. Grip. Most hardware stores carry Mr. Grip, which is a thin
strip of aluminum perforated to look like a cheese grater. Fold a
piece of this into the hole (use more than one if necessary) and
the screw will hold wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, do as the pros do: Drill a 1/2- or 5/8-inch hole
where the screw hole is, through the door, and glue in a dowel. Cut
the dowel flush on both sides of the door, then drive the screw
into the dowel; predrill a pilot hole, but for goodness sake, don't
make it too big!
</P>
<P>
   How can you saw a dowel flush with the door surface without
messing up the door? That one is easy: Use a Japanese saw. The
blade is flexible enough to bend it to saw the dowel straight and
flush, without getting in your way or damaging the door.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to replace the wall-to-wall carpeting in my basement
family room's concrete floor, or install another type. It is 10 to
15 years old. The floor people I talked to did not recommend Pergo,
the new laminated plastic floor, on a cellar slab, but rather to
install new wall-to-wall carpeting. Now I am on the horns of a
dilemma. What is best to use?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA PUGH, Merrimack, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Good question, but the fact that it is going on a concrete
cellar floor limits your choices, because water vapor is constantly
coming up through that concrete, and it is difficult to stop
effectively to prevent moisture problems.
</P>
<P>
   So, install new wall-to-wall carpeting, but more important is
that this carpeting be indoor-outdoor carpeting, which does allow
water vapor to go through it, not trapping it where it could
condense into water. The flooring people you consulted know this,
and that is why they recommended new carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   Such carpet is not very attractive, but it is the most reliable
flooring for this application. You can add a synthetic jute pad for
comort. You can reduce this ``ugly'' look by putting down Oriental
area rugs right on top, which also allow water vapor to go through.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Pergo (and other brands of laminated flooring), it is
handsome and a good product, and its makers suggest that it can be
applied on a cellar floor. That's fine if it adheres to the floor
to prevent water vapor from being trapped under it and condensing
into water. The flooring people simply disagree.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about wall-to-wall carpeting: 10 to 12 years is a
pretty short time before replacing it. It's also interesting to
note that the laminated plastic floors ware warranted 15 years,
also a short life for a floor covering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some more information is offered to Linda Baker of Waltham,
Mass., whose lights kept flickering and dimming when she turned
some of them on. The handyman suggested that her circuits were
overloaded and the extra draw of power from the turned-on lights
caused the dimming, and to reduce the number of lights and
appliances on the circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Partially right. Electrician Bernard Kummins of Marblehead,
Mass. called to suggest that Linda Baker look for loose connections
in the wiring system, possibly the white wires. That is a good
point, but the handyman adds that if Linda Baker is not familiar
with electricity, not to inspect any wiring without first turning
off the power. Better yet, call an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Kummins, addressing the handyman, you got the
information on fuses backwards. The way to tell how a fuse failed
by looking through the fuse window, is this: A burned window, all
smoky looking is caused by a short circuit. A broken filament in
the fuse is caused by an overload.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the handyman is back, and we will remember. Better yet, we
will write it down. And that is what we did with Bernard Kummins
and his phone number, for future references whenever a problem
comes up. Thanks, Bernard Kummins, who is now our consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Charles E. Small of Westford, Mass., an
engineer and electrician who called to tell us about our wrong
description of fuse failure. And thanks, Charles Small.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Everything is fine in the house I bought three yars ago,
except one thing: The front door thumb latch is stuck and I cannot
budge it. What happened and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   LEN SMITH, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It got jammed, or the spring broke or slipped out of
position. Take it out of the door and take it apart to see where
the spring has sprung. If that does not appeal, take it to a
locksmith, who I bet will fix it in five minutes.
</P>
<P>

GOP'S ALSO-RANS STRIVE TO KEEP UP THE PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not hugely popular with voters, consistently polling in
single digits. Reporters don't rush to them for comment every time
Governor George W. Bush or Senator John McCain makes news. They
haven't got bulging coffers, armies of staffers, advertising
blitzes, or special campaign windbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alan Keyes, Senator Orrin Hatch, and Gary Bauer are still
here, chasing the Republican presidential nomination as fervently
today as they were months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Bauer, going before feisty New Hampshire teenagers who
don't like his views on religion and abortion, fighting the Bush
campaign to be allowed to stand on a box to debate him.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Keyes, driving across Iowa, drawing suburban crowds,
scattering paid speaking engagements among the campaign stops to
make up for his lost salary as a radio talk-show host, rebuking
reporters who he says ignore him because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   And here is Hatch, a Senate institution, looking mostly forlorn
as his five rivals trade barbs around him, scraping together
$50,000 for a televised, 28-minute, low-key ``fireside chat'' to
Iowa audiences focused on the failings of the Clinton
administration and on the details of his long record as a
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters, and even some Republicans, are asking why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had time to make an impact,'' said Richard Bond,
former national chairman of the GOP. ``And they haven't. Either
Bush or McCain is going to be the Republican nominee. And I would
be much more interested in hearing their views fleshed out in
greater detail than in Alan Keyes' temper tantrums.''
</P>
<P>
   The three candidates steadfastly maintain they are running
because they believe America needs them as president, that the
other candidates can't cut it, and that if they could only catch a
break, they'd walk away with the job.
</P>
<P>
   Others impute less direct, and even less noble, motives to them:
excessive ego, an attempt to raise their public profiles, a
national platform for their views. All of which, of course, they
deny.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, an antiabortion activist and former Reagan administration
official, knows there are some who want him gone from the contest.
He knows that his small roadside signs in dozens of New Hampshire
towns are no match for the slick television advertisements produced
by the campaigns of Bush, McCain, and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But when the lights go up and the TV cameras roll on for another
in a seemingly interminable series of televised Republican debates,
the low-tech publicity, sparsely attended news conferences, and
derisive pundits fade away. Because on stage, everybody gets nearly
equal time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the most dramatic thing is going out in the debates
and only seeing six chairs out there and realizing one of them is
for you,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the debates, each of the three candidates lagging in the
polls has given their three rivals _ and the debate moderators _
plenty of grief. Witness Hatch's quip that he couldn't lift
Forbes's wallet; Bauer's response of ``So would we, Governor'' to
Bush's assertion that he would get to the White House and say,
``God help me''; and Keyes's loud refusal to yield the floor to
NBC's Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   For many observers, those debates are the keys to the three
candidates' blind persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get to stand on stage with the other candidates and
present passionate and articulate positions,'' said Republican
consultant Thomas Rath, who is running Bush's campaign in New
Hampshire. ``This is their moment. Few of them harbor the illusion
at the end of the day that absent some dramatic event, they'll be
the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, for example, gets the voice of Christian conservatives
into every debate, as does Keyes. They both constantly invoke the
Declaration of Independence, and its reference to a creator, to
buttress their calls to reinsert morality into American public
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is the reason Bauer is staying in the race is to make
certain the Christian right has a voice at the nominating
convention and a spokesperson who has some credibility
nationally,'' said Rath.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer rejects that claim. He was a voice at the last GOP
convention as head of the Family Research Council, he argues. He's
in it to win, he says. And he can still win it, because he's still
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, who conventional wisdom would dictate would be in the
race long after I was gone, are not,'' he said at a Milford, N.H.,
diner recently. ``The only thing that's changed is what name they
throw up to me in interiews: `Mr. Bauer, come on, how can you
possibly beat Elizabeth Dole?' `Mr. Bauer, come on, how can you
possibly defeat Dan Quayle?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are happy to have Bauer and Keyes stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyes is a very eloquent speaker, and by staying in the race
he elevates the party,'' said Will Abbott, who was then-Vice
President George Bush's New Hampshire political director in 1988.
``Because he's black he elevates the party, demonstrates firsthand
that there are black Republicans. And if he stays on the right side
of Bush, he'll get a role in the government out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who is chagrined by characterizations focused on his
race, says he is in the race for the purest of purposes. ``If I get
the nomination, I have the strongest chance of anybody in the field
of winning the election,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, too, is convinced he is the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think I could do a better job than all the rest of
these people, I wouldn't be doing it,'' said the Utah senator.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could get past the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem today is not that people don't want me,'' he said.
``Everywhere I go, people say, `I wish you could make it, Senator.'
But every interview I have, it starts out with `Senator, you're a
giant in the Senate, you're one of the great senators,' _ I'm not
saying that, they say it _ and `Why would you do this so late?' and
`You don't have a chance.' Every one of them has said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's candidacy ``really tugs at my heartstrings,'' said Bond,
the former GOP chairman, ``because he has conducted himself with
such humanity and dignity and probably of all of them carried the
case against the Clinton administration most effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he is mystified as to why the senator is putting
himself through the campaign. He said he wants Hatch, Keyes, and
Bauer, to withdraw, for the good of whoever becomes the nominee.
Democratic contenders Bill Bradley and Al Gore will be
better-prepared for the general election, since they've been
debating one-on-one all this time, Bond said. He would like Bush
and McCain to have the same opportunity to hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a degree of political correctness within the party and
within the media that says if a person says they're running, that
entitles them to the microphone,'' he said. ``And I believe that in
the national debates in the fall and in these primary debates,
there ought to be a basic viability test. It doesn't matter if
they're a distinguished senator or loquacious talk-show host, there
shold be a threshold of viability.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason these candidates have stuck around until now
is that they can. In New Hampshire, and in Iowa, they can run
low-overhead, retail-politics campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is small enough that you can get around without
spending a ton of money,'' said Rath. ``It's a place where an upset
can get started. Why not roll the dice, play through here, and see
what happens.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nashville, Jacksonville, St. Louis, Tampa ...
</P>
<P>
   What, no Hooterville? In an NFL season that is making about as
much sense as an episode of ``Green Acres,'' the road to the Super
Bowl should have the decency to pass through Hooterville at some
point.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting so you can't tell the NFL season from a ``Hee Haw''
salutes flashback. The last four teams standing are the Tennessee
Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, St. Louis Rams and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Rams or the Buccaneers will represent the NFC at
Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta. Either the Titans or the Jaguars will
succeed the Denver Broncos as the AFC entry. Either we're on the
cusp of the apocalypse, or we should be.
</P>
<P>
   Where have all the Cowboys gone? To the same black hole that
swallowed up the Broncos, and Packers, and 49ers and Steelers. The
Jaguars, Titans, Rams and Buccaneers franchises collectively have
as many Super Bowl victories as William Shatner has Academy Awards.
As bad an idea as it may seem for one of those franchises to become
the center of the NFL universe, it's the law.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jacksonville _ please. Here's a city whose cultural claim
to fame is having multiple Hooters restaurants. Jacksonville is a
place where excitement goes to die. KC &AMP; the Sunshine band is
scheduled to perform at halftime of the AFC title game against
Tennessee. The Bay City Rollers apparently had a prior commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for its part, is the place the Titans went when
nobody else would have them. The Titans, who used to be the Houston
Oilers, are playing in their fourth home stadium in four years.
Nashville is a great place to go if you're looking for a place
where you can blend in wearing a rhinestone shirt and a cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa traditionally has been one of the NFL's favorite tourist
attractions _ a nice place to visit for any team in desperate need
of a victory. The Buccaneers once had 12 consecutive seasons of
double-digit defeats. They ended that streak in '95 by going 7-9.
Take away the 80-degree temperatures, the beach and the topless
clubs, and you're left with a procession of cars tooling around at
15 mph under the speed limit with the left blinker constantly
flashing.
</P>
<P>
   As football hotbeds go, St. Louis is a wonderful baseball town.
The locals routinely pack Busch Stadium to support Cardinals teams
mired in mediocrity. The football Cardinals played in St. Louis 29
years and never won a playoff game. The Rams entered this season
with a 9-23 record under coach Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars are a 5-year-old expansion team. The Titans are in
the midst of their first winning season since '93. The Rams have
the NFL's worst record of the '90s. The Buccaneers have the
third-worst record of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, these four teams have a combined 56-13 record
this season. Somehow, some way, one of them is going to be the next
Super Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel blessed with the opportunity that has been put to
us,'' Rams linebacker London Fletcher said, ``and we just want to
make the most of it, because we know nothing is guaranteed to us
next season. You look at the Atlanta Falcons ...''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, don't look. It's not polite to stare at the
afflicted. Of last year's Final Four, only the Minnesota Vikings
returned to the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams started the season with Vermeil in tears over a
season-ending injury to starting quarterback Trent Green. Arena
Football League refugee Kurt Warner became the quarterback by
default and quickly put an end to the crying game. Warner passed
for 4,392 yards and 41 touchdowns during the regular season. Trent
who? In a 49-37 Divisional Playoff victory against Minnesota,
Warner passed for 391 yards and five touchdowns. He spread his 27
completions to 10 different receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got weapons all over the place,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers offense, meanwhile, operates as if driven by
Shetland pony and buggy. Tampa Bay finished the season 28th out of
31 teams in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think we are just going to try and do what we do
best,'' Buccaneers running back Warrick Dunn said. ``That is, win
football games with our defense and play hard-nosed football with
our offense. That is all you can ask from us.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's all the Buccaneers ask of themselves, their season is
going to end this weekend. For all the hosannas thrown the way of
the Tampa Bay defense, it allowed only seven fewer points (235)
than the Rams (242). The Rams outscored Tampa Bay by 256 points.
</P>
<P>
   The real intrigue is in the AFC title game. Jacksonville is
15-2, with both defeats coming against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans will arrive in Jacksonville on a wave of good karma.
</P>
<P>
   The Music City Miracle _ a 75-yard kickoff return on a
questionable lateral _ got the Titans past Buffalo in a wild-card
game. An instant replay reversal wiped out an Indianapolis Colts
long punt return last week. Why, it's enough to make up for the
time four years ago when the Titans (then the Oilers) returned from
a road trip greeted by all of two fans singing the fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville. Jacksonville. St. Louis. Tampa. One of those cities
is about to become the greenest pasture in the NFL. One of those
cities is about to have a long, luxurious, last laugh.

`PLAY IT TO THE BONE' IS DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PLAY IT TO THE BONE 
Directed and written by: Ron Shelton 
Starring: Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich, Tom
Sizemore, Lucy Liu, Robert Wagner, Richard Masur, Willie Garson,
Cylk Cozart, Jack Carter, Aida Turturro 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: R (brutal ring violence, strong sexuality including
dialogue, nudity, pervasive language and some drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' is a comedy dedicated to the proposition
that white men can't box. But while writer-director Ron Shelton,
Hollywood's favorite jock, says that boxing is his favorite sport,
his new sports movie can't match the off-the-wall larkiness of such
previous Shelton winners as ``Bull Durham,'' ``White Men Can't
Jump,'' and ``Tin Cup.'' There's a pattern to Shelton's films.
Essentially, they're buddy movies that women characters are allowed
to crash, provided they're eccentric enough. This time, the buddies
are Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson as washed-up boxers in LA.
They get a phone call from Las Vegas that won't necessarily change
their lives, but might reduce their debt levels.
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of prelim fighters knock themselves out of a
scheduled warmup bout in advance of a Mike Tyson fight, the
promoters need two cheap replacements in a hurry. Next thing they
know, Banderas's Cesar Dominguez and Harrelson's Vince Boudreau are
flooring it to Vegas in the Caddy of Lolita Davidovich's Grace, who
was involved with Vince, is now involved with Cesar, and
consequently knows enough to not let either borrow her car.
Besides, if you can overlook the question of why the promoters
didn't simply fly the two fading middleweights out, she spices up
the road trip, especially when it becomes apparent in her fielding
of the clumsy advances of each that she's not being driven by sex,
but by entrepreneurial vigor, harboring, as she does, a few ideas
about her own career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have the setup. They all have hustler's instincts,
but they're not clever enough to carry them far. There's something
fetching in their cozy seediness. The road comedy is momentarily
enlivened by the presence of Lucy Liu's hitchhiker, who comes on
sultry, but proves merely surly. Still, the banter soon seems
stretched too thin, and the action, such as it is, does little to
get them through the pockets of dead air in the script.
Surprisingly, there's little in the film that seems specific to
boxing. The big sharks paying the little fish $50,000 apiece have
their amusing moments, especially Robert Wagner's slickster, but
the lot of them come across as merely generic crooks. Seldom does
the film give us the feeling that it's ushering us into the details
of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Vince and Cesar finally climb into the ring, the
film has lost its bid to convince us they're funny losers. Shifting
direction, Shelton tries for beautiful losers, especially as round
after round passes and they keep pounding each other to bloody
pulp, yet somehow keep answering the bell for the next round. Both
throw themselves into their bashing with dedication, but the
spectacle of their brute honor played against the sleazos robbing
them blind with every click of a ballpoint pen is neither ironic
enough to amuse nor truly feeling enough to move us. Davidovich has
some nice scatty moments, and it can't be said that the two guys
don't swing away. But, simpatico as they are in their everyday
struggles, ``Play It to the Bone'' isn't going to be a contender.

`TITUS' SERVES UP GORY EXCESS BRILLIANTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TITUS 
Directed and adapted by: Julie Taymor (based on Shakespeare's
play) 
Starring: Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Colm Feore,
James Frain, Laura Fraser, Harry Lennix, Angus Macfadyen, Matthew
Rhys, Jonathan Rhys Myers 
Running time: 160 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violent sexual images) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shakespeare was not in love when he wrote ``Titus Andronicus.''
He served up a gorefest to the groundlings. When people cite the
violence in movies, I send them to the Greeks and Shakespeare. Once
they've digested, so to speak, the handiwork of Oedipus and Medea,
I ask them to consider ``Titus Andronicus,'' a play with its share
of quotable lines, but with little character depth, less than the
usual amount of Shakespearean poetry and a lot more shock-theater
brutality and bloodshed. It posits a Rome so far gone that you can
no longer tell the difference between the Romans and the Goths.
Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Jason of hockey-mask fame have
nothing on ``Titus Andronicus,'' the play with Shakespeare's most
vivid stage direction, referring to Titus's daughter: ``Enter
Lavinia ravished, with her tongue cut out and her hands cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor's filmed ``Titus'' is a brilliant production of a
mediocre play. Unlike some stage directors, Taymor is never
inhibited by the screen's version of naturalistic space. Creating a
metaphysical, surrealistic space, she fills it grandly,
confidently, and strikingly. The Lavinia scene unfolds in a vast
marshy waste. When poor brutalized Lavinia appears, the horror is
heightened by bundles of twigs tied to the bloody stumps of her
wrists. Taymor and her magnificent production designer, Dante
Ferretti, meld massive classic architecture with fascist
architecture _ with Mussolini's constant message, frozen into those
intimidatingly looming monoliths, that the state is all and the
individual is nothing. That I have waited this long to get to the
stars _ Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix
_ only means that the pitiless, crushing look of the world of this
``Titus'' is the ultimate star here.
</P>
<P>
   As any student of Shakespearean excess can tell you, the carnage
climaxes with the vengeful Titus chopping up the rapists and
serving them in a meat pie to an emperor and a queen, and if you
don't think the Hannibal Lecter factor crossed Taymor's mind when
she cast Hopkins, the wicked gleam in his eyes will convince you it
did. With its frequent linkages of power, rigidity, and madness,
the film raises the question of whether Taymor is bidding to become
the millennial Orson Welles or the millennial Leni Riefenstahl _ or
both. Whatever else he was, Welles was always a showman who saw
himself as a bit of a flim-flam man. Remember his ``F for Fake''?
And there's more than a smidgen of ``Triumph of the Will'' in
Taymor's production of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   The fascist iconography is hammeringly amplified here, from
Roman legions caked in gray mud to heighten their anonymous
chess-piece look, to production design that fuses Caesar and
Mussolini, linking Imperial Rome to fascist Italy, with
Colosseum-like structures giving way to huge blocky buildings on
vast plazas, the kind of aggrandizing architecture that suggests
Albert Speer's conception of heaven. Still, flim-flam is what
Taymor needs in ``Titus,'' where the problem is not the usual one
of bringing great Shakespearean poetry to life, but rather to keep
gushers of stage blood from drowning the evening in ludicrousness.
To an amazing degree she brings it off with striking visuals that
begin with a contemporary boy smashing action figures together on a
kitchen table for the benefit of those who might miss the parallel
to come.
</P>
<P>
   He's whisked off to Imperial Rome, where live, stylized action
figures kill one another even faster than the kid was offing his
plastic and metal ones. The destruction begins when Titus, home
from defeating the Goths, proves a too-trusting butcher who turns
down the crown, only to find the insecure new emperor, Alan
Cumming's Saturninus, a sizzling lightweight with a Hitler haircut,
his own brother and Titus's grown children. Saturninus is egged on
by Jessica Lange's Tamora, queen of the Goths, who turns defeat
into victory by sleeping her way into the emperor's bed, advancing
as well her two surviving disco-lout sons and her scheming moorish
lover, Harry Lennix's Aaron _ the play's only psychologically
interesting character _ who suggests Othello metamorphosed into
Iago, all the while reminding us that racist stereotypes, like
horror stories, weren't invented yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The visual stylings and diversions, a large part of which
consist of dissolving the time gap between yesterday's Roman armor
and today's black leather and black fedoras, work for a while. And
there's pleasure to be taken in the command and authority brought
to the lines by Hopkins and Cumming, and especially the tigerish
ferocity of Lange's Tamora, who's enough of a force of nature to
make you overlook her gold costumes and their Fort Knox look. She
not only burns up the screen. She's also persuasively motivated by
the ritual execution of her oldest son. They give the lines all the
ring and heft one could hope for. But snazzy as the visuals are,
they can carry the story only so far. ``Titus'' starts to deflate
in the scene of the rape of Titus's daughter, partly because it's
played out in what by now is standard MTV montage style, a rare
moment of brutality diluted rather than amped up, as happens almost
all the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's always rewarding to watch Hopkins work, even in a lesser
role, even when this filmed ``Titus'' stops reminding us of the
reach of Welles and Riefenstahl, stops seeming monumental and
begins triggering memories of Peter Greenaway's ``The Cook, the
Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'' in the notorious pie scene. Cumming
impressively ladles out Saturninus's rants and simpers in glam-rock
style, and Lange never looks back, going the silent screen vamp
route. Film buffs will notice echoes of Fellini and Bertolucci,
among other sources. Shakespeare buffs will notice echoes of
Shakespeare. ``Titus Andronicus'' is not one of his masterpieces
and eventually there's no hiding the fact that this film of it is
only MTV-deep. Still, until this ``Titus'' runs out of inner life,
it's exhilarating to watch Taymor step up to the plate and take
some big swings before subsiding into the blood-drenched fustian.
After all, ``Titus'' needs all the help it can get, and Taymor
gives it plenty.

`ASHES' AS DARK AS THE DEPTHS OF MCCOURT'S TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ANGELA'S ASHES 
Directed by: Alan Parker 
Screenplay by: Laura Jones, Parker (based on Frank McCourt's
memoir) 
Starring: Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens,
Michael Legge 
Running time: 140 minutes 
Rated: R (sexual content and some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Parker's film of ``Angela's Ashes'' is more than an
exquisitely photographed coffee table book version of Frank
McCourt's luminous memoir of growing up crushingly poor in Ireland
in the 1930s and '40s. But not much more. Not that it's altogether
calendar art. Parker does intermittently capture the innate
vitality and undentable survivalism of young Frank, played by three
actors taking Frank from boyhood to puberty to late adolescence.
When we see the face of 8-year-old Joe Breen, brow clouded with
anger, lower lip jutting truculently out, Parker does the job film
is supposed to do. This is an angry kid, kept going by his anger.
When the teenage Frank, played by Ciaran Owens, comes splashing
down his wet street and through their miserable slum, flooded with
sewage, he's flying, high on the exuberance of just being a kid,
removed for a few moments from the daily misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' needs more such outcroppings, boiling up from
its texture of sodden grayness. But the film is too often trapped
in its own reverence and solemnity to often get around to actually
coming to rude, throbbing life. Not that anybody could stand
``Angela's Ashes'' being turned into a feel-good film, or even an
upbeat one. It is, after all, about poverty. And not just poverty.
Meanness as well, from the clerical class and its minions, who with
too few exceptions dispensed nine parts humiliation to one part
charity _ when they were feeling charitable. Meanness also from
many of the McCourts' relatives and neighbors _ although not all.
Parker has taken great pains to get the representations right
imagistically, and then dump sheet after sheet of rain on them _
rain, of course, being another thing that blighted life in
Limerick, where the clammy dampness of the River Shannon raised
respiratory hell.
</P>
<P>
   While the film dutifully reproduces many incidents from the
book, it lacks the spirit and vitality of its source. And _ no
small and _ McCourt's voice knitting the vignettes together. There
was no way life among the McCourts could not have been glum for
long stretches. But it never seemed as dispirited in the book as it
mostly does here. The film cries out for more of the offhand
unruliness of Parker's ``The Commitments.'' I think the cast could
easily have provided it. As McCourt's irresponsible father, who
drank his wages on those rare occasions when he found work, Robert
Carlyle gets the important things right. He makes us understand why
his kids loved him. He's a soft man, a dreamer, no match for the
hard-bitten types who denied him work because he was a Protestant
from the north. The one thing he gave his kids was stories, and a
love of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film is unflinching about the disintegration of the
McCourts' family life, etched in the expressions of hurt and
disappointment of his wife and kids each time he comes home
empty-handed from what was to be yet another new beginning. When
Frank and his younger brother, Malachy, scowl at their dad, and
accusatorily say in turn, ``Da, you drank the money,'' nothing much
more can be added. Except that it is added by Emily Watson. As
Angela McCourt, she plays a kind of role we've never seen her play,
a woman boiling with strong emotions, but keeping them inside as
she lights up another cigarette or hits the streets in search of
stray pieces of coal fallen from trucks. Their return to
famine-stricken Ireland from Brooklyn in 1935 _ one of the few
instances of reverse migration _ was prompted by a nervous
breakdown she suffered when her infant daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been others. She spent a lot of time in bed,
staring at the wall. And yet her strength was enormous. She would
subject herself to certain humiliation, time after time, to keep
her children fed. She is anything but a hapless sufferer. In
``Breaking the Waves'' and ``Hilary and Jackie,'' Watson played
women who expressed themselves in torrents of emotion. Here, she
has no big arias. There's never a dramatically convenient
resolution, just a wonderful range of facial expressions, telling
us everything we need to know of the dwindling trust and love and
finally an emotional closing-off from the man who so often
disappointed his family. In a way, it's the most subtle acting she
has yet given us.
</P>
<P>
   When the Frank of late adolescence appears, rays of light
figuratively appear with him, because we know he's going to get out
and go back to America. His sexual initiation is as sad and funny
as it is in the book _ although not as funny as young Frank
thinking he's hit the jackpot when he gets typhoid and is
hospitalized, which means he eats well, is warm, and has his own
lavatory. Still, part of the film's shortfall is its inability to
regenerate McCourt's incisive humor and even more singluar
lyricism. Given the removal of the author's distinctive voice
knitting his stories together, ``Angela's Ashes'' is probably as
close as we could realistically have expected a film version to
come. But there's no getting around the fact that it's not the
equal of the book.

LEIGH LEAVES OUT USUAL COLLISIONS IN `TOPSY-TURVY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TOPSY-TURVY 
Written and directed by: Mike Leigh 
Starring: Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Timothy Spall, Lesley
Manville, Ron Cook, Wendy Nottingham, Kevin McKidd, Shirley
Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Eleanor David, Jessie
Bond, Leonora Branham 
Running time: 160 minutes 
Rated: R (for a scene of risque nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two genres meet in Mike Leigh's new film, ``Topsy-Turvy'' _ the
biopic and the c'mon-kids-let's-do-a-show movie. Except that
``Topsy-Turvy'' starts out as a c'mon-kids-let's-not-do-a-show
movie. In London in 1884 Gilbert and Sullivan have just written the
eighth of their 14 comic operas, ``Princess Ida,'' and it is not
going well. Part of the trouble is that a heat wave is keeping
attendance down. But most of the trouble stems from their fear that
their creative vitality is eroding, that they are growing stale,
repetitious, formulaic. Under the terms of their contract with
impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, they are obliged to deliver one
more comic opera. But Allan Corduner's Sullivan just doesn't think
he has any more music in him, at least none with Jim Broadbent's
melancholy Gilbert. Sullivan wants to focus on grander opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' really is a new film for Leigh, a new kind of
film. For once he is not focusing on contemporary characters, but
instead is going back to fill in the spaces between what's known
about the public Gilbert and Sullivan. His starting point is
exactly the right one. He has loved their music for years. He began
talking about making this movie as early as 1991. But because his
usual working method of protracted improvisations does not result
in his actors owning their characters here, but only borrowing them
from history, there's something missing from the dynamic. For the
first time, a Mike Leigh film seems inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   The actors are splendid. They know just where to go with their
backstage humor and fears and bickering and serve everything up
with freshness and flavor. But it's not enough of a backstage
musical to work on those terms, although Gilbert and Sullivan's
emergence from their slump with a triumphant, resplendent new work
called ``The Mikado'' makes you wish they had included more of it.
Otherwise, though, the characters too often seem corseted by
playing Victorians from another world, another London. Broadbent is
a first-rate actor, but often it's difficult to tell whether his
discomfort is the result of Gilbert's natural glumness (which may
have begun with his parents' nasty divorce) or some uneasiness he
may be feeling at only partially nailing his character. Certainly
he has the most emotion-filled scenes, even though he himself
rarely expresses anything more than pessimism. So self-absorbed is
he that it never occurs to him that being around him a lot would
make most people want to slash their wrists, not write buoyant
settings to his sparklingly nimble lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The loneliness that has settled like a pall over Gilbert and his
loving wife, played by Lesley Manville in ways that make her the
most admirably faceted and complex character, is caught with
understated delicacy, also a believably practical side that
convinces you she knows what's good for him. Alone together is what
they are, but while he's inclined to go on like the Woody Allen of
the Savoy about the emptiness of success and the meaninglessness of
it all, she's the one who drags him to London's Japanese exhibit,
after which the light bulb figuratively clicks on over his head and
his dry spell is over. Corduner, too, turns in a performance of
remarkable delicacy, playing Sullivan as a wistful hedonist whose
trouble just may be an excessive readiness to please. Or at least
to not disappoint people. This piece of retroactive character
analysis works.
</P>
<P>
   The actors playing actors are lively and entertaining, starting
with Timothy Spall (whose song about the punishment fitting the
crime nearly is trimmed), Kevin McKidd, Martin Savage, Leonora
Branham, and Jessie Bond, a delight in the soubrette role. It's not
that ``Topsy-Turvy'' lacks things to enjoy. But this time Leigh
isn't plunging as deeply into the minds and hearts and psychologies
of his characters as he usually does. Too often, we get
representations. Beautifully fashioned representations, and miles
beyond what any Hollywood biopic would have made of them, but
representations all the same, too often opaque. In the end, it's
the snatches of music, mangled as it is, and the mechanics of
staging it, in the absence of Leigh's usual raw, urgent psychic
collisions, that keeps ``Topsy-Turvy'' from seeming merely a
gorgeous wax museum.

<P>
   NEWRY, Maine _ There are more conventional ways to travel 6
miles across a frozen lake than hitching five yipping Yukon huskies
to a wooden toboggan sled and balancing on narrow runners while the
dogs charge off, full speed.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ask Kevin Slater, a professional musher and
dog-sledding zealot, you won't find a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, co-owner with Polly Mahoney of Mahoosuc Guide Service
near Bethel, is about as close as you'll find to the genuine polar
article without traveling high above the 49th parallel or watching
old TV episodes of ``Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Mahoney own 39 mixed-breed huskies hailing from the
northern reaches of Canada, including some pups descended from the
last Royal Canadian Mounted Police dog team in the Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find Gore-Tex snow treads or insulated guide gear on
this musher: He wears mukluks on his feet and a sash-tied parka
made for him by an Inuit friend in the Arctic territory of Nunavit,
the garment trimmed with the black shiny fur of what was once his
favorite lead dog. As for his dog sleds (he prefers the Inuit word
``quamatik''), he made them himself, out of white ash.
</P>
<P>
   Spend a couple of days with Slater and his dogs _ as did eight
hardy souls last weekend on an Appalachian Mountain Club-sponsored
mushing and camping trip on Umbagog Lake _ and you come away with a
vision of Slater as a white man (as he often refers to himself) who
should have been an Inuit. ``Maybe I was, in another life,'' he
says, only half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   You may also come away with a hankering for another dog-sled
trip _ as did Terry Maitland, 52, a real estate broker in Acton,
Mass., who found himself hooked on Huskies. ``I could go for a lot
more dog sledding,'' says Maitland. ``There is a lot of preparation
and standing around and getting ready. But once you take off, it's
exhilarating. Your imagination just races along with it. You're not
exactly on Maine on a frozen lake. You are somewhere else. You are
White Fang. You're ``The Call of the Wild.'' We are all sort of
swashbucklers in our imagination, and this is a little taste of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just guests extraordinaires,'' says nouveau dog sledder
Katy Wolf, 49, of Lexington, Mass., who took the trip both because
``I'm crazy about adventures,'' and to overcome a childhood fear of
large dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it, a Mahoosuc-guided dog-sled trip is
not what Slater pejoratively refers to as ``tourist mushing.''
(Definition: ``sitting in a sled like a sack of potatoes and going
for a little half-hour ride in a circle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it for the faint of heart, weak of spirit, or lazy of
body, even though a weekend dog-sled trip is pretty modest by
Slater's standards: He and Mahoney also guide longer trips in the
Arctic with an Inuit family, and in Quebec with Cree Indian
families. There's a good deal of effort involved, even though the
guides do most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing that quite compares with a dog-sled ride on an
icy lake _ not skiing, not skating, not snowshoeing. And certainly
not snowmobiling. The dogs usually don't break down or run out of
gas, and are quiet enough not to scare away the otters or birds
that appear along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like taking a train and sort of staring out the
window,'' offers Todd Hoener, publisher of the Alaska-based
magazine called ``Mushing.'' ``It's very quiet, except sooner or
later you have to tell the dogs to go one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   This is done by yelling the command ``gee'' for a right turn and
``haw'' for a left, and hoping the dogs don't stage a mutiny. A
foot brake stops the sled, since ``the dogs won't stop unless you
stop them,'' Slater says.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, this particular sunny weekend, was spectacular _ once
the dogs, who were out of the blocks at about 12 miles an hour,
slowed to a steady jog. With a panoramic view of the lake,
enveloping rows of still spruce and fir trees, a line of humans
mixed with the dogs that pull them along the ice, the ride was an
``utterly good experience,'' says Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   It was not marred by the winter camping experience that
followed, which had unnerved several of the mushers before they got
on their way. (That entailed sleeping in a canvas-sided tent,
sleeping on soft tree boughs, and using what Slater calls an
``out'' _ an outhouse without the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his attachment to the lifestyle, Slater himself grew up
far from the great white north, in rural Appalachia. He moved
northward right out of high school _ first to Maine and eventually
to Alaska, because ``I always liked snow and cold weather,'' he
says. ``I hate it when it's over 75 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, he had his first introduction to dog sledding, and
developed a love for ``hooking up a dog team and traveling across
the frozen north country for a month or two at a time. ``I was
never interested in racing,'' Slater says. ``I think it's silly.
For me, dog sledding was just a way to travel in the north and meet
like-minded natives who still use dog teams.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a guy from Appalachia come to identify so strongly with
aboriginal people from the north? According to Slater, they have a
lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents were aboriginal people in Ireland, the Celts,
who emigrated from County Donegal. They were very, very
traditional, complete with pre-Christianity superstitions and
beliefs _ like the wee people of the underworld. I can see a lot of
parallels between the traditional cultures of Ireland and native
cultures. When I was growing up, I didn't think it was weird or
unusual to believe in spirits running around the woods. I was
primed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while he was up north that he met Mahoney, a native
Mainer who had spent a decade living in the bush of the Yukon
Territory, using her own sled dogs to get around and to haul
firewood and water. About 10 years ago they started Mahoosuc Guide
Service, based in the Bear River Valley. And while dog sledding is
in no danger of becoming a viable mode of transportation, Slater's
contagious passion for his dogs has influenced at least a few
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Christine Richardson of Vershire, Vt., who went out on
a weekend trip with Slater seven years ago, and says the experience
was ``a turning point'' in her life. She went right out and bought
herself a sled, and now owns 14 sled dogs. Now, they're an
obsession, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was agog when I went on that trip,'' she recalls. ``Kevin
didn't want to wear synthetic clothes. He's really taken with the
Inuit. He chopped up beaver to feed his dogs. His lead dog slept in
his tent with him. It is a real dog-sled trip, with real dogs. And
I think he would have given his life for those dogs.''

FLAGPOLE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, David Beasley, was governor of South Carolina.
Today, he works as a business consultant for a Boston law firm. His
political fate was pretty much sealed after he became the first
governor to call for moving the Confederate battle flag from atop
his statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   His effort to move the flag to a nearby Civil War monument
alienated thousands of voters who belong to the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and other Southern heritage groups. But Beasley _ a
Republican _ was also abandoned by some of the same constituencies
now insisting it is so important to lower the Confederate flag in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites, played politics
with the issue,'' says Beasley of his own Confederate flag
experience in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They are still playing politics with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag is a symbol of war, slavery, and racism. As
such, it is morally repugnant and should fly over no statehouse in
this country. But don't be fooled into thinking its emergence as an
issue now has anything to do with a serious discussion of race
relations in America. It is more symbolic of the shallowness of
American politics, especially American presidential politics, than
it is symbolic of any true moral outrage about the racial divide in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol in Iowa, taxes in New Hampshire, the Confederate flag in
South Carolina. It is all so very predictable. Sometime quite soon,
the presidential campaign caravan will move into New York. We'll
know it because the candidates will be talking about Israel, in an
effort to push the levers for the Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's worth stepping back from today's headlines about
the controversy in South Carolina to reflect on what happened in
1996, when Beasley suggested taking down the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Some degree of political calculation inspired him then; some, no
doubt, inspires him now. Beasley supports George W. Bush, who is
under attack, along with John W. McCain, for refusing to say the
Confederate flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley's fellow Republicans blocked him in the state
Legislature. But he contends that Democrats stranded him, as well,
because it didn't suit their purposes to offer him political
support at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Of Vice President Gore, who says the flag should come down as he
seeks the Democratic party nomination for president, Beasley says:
``It upsets me when I see Al Gore out there talking about this
issue. . . . In 1996 and 1997, when I first proposed this, Al Gore
did not make one single phone call to me. Neither did one Democrat,
black or white.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Beasley: ``Now, Mr. Gore is making this an issue, saying
Mr. Bush should speak out. If anyone has a right to determine who
should speak out, it's me. I'm the one who paid the ultimate
political price. Mr. Gore lifted not one single finger when it was
the issue of the day. He was AWOL. He did nothing . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the NAACP, which is also making this an issue in
2000, Beasley says: ``Their hands are not clean, their hearts are
not pure. In 1996 and 1997, the NAACP did not get behind our
efforts because of pure, old, rotten politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure, old, rotten politics. That means, if you are a Democrat,
you don't speak up if it helps a Republican and vice versa. It also
means, you pretend you are running a positive campaign, when,
behind the scenes, you are up to the same old tricks and
doubletalk.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls McCain ``my good friend'' and slops all over him for
the cameras. But watch the news and read the newspapers and you
know the Texas governor has primed his organization to drop dimes
about McCain's temper, sanity, and fund-raising. McCain, meanwhile,
campaigns on the Straight Talk Express. But obviously his advisers
put an end to straight talk in South Carolina, after it caused
problems with flag supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore speaks with passion about the Confederate flag and
what it symbolizes. If his passion were real, he could have
exercised his moral authority three years ago as vice president and
not let Beasley's party affiliation temper his alleged fervor. At
the same time, Gore's Democratic opponent, former Senator Bill
Bradley, tries to convince us he wants a thoughtful dialogue on
race _ then does his best to blame Gore for the racist Willie
Horton ad that so damaged Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley is not pure either. He insists he still believes South
Carolina should take down the Confederate flag, but he also insists
Bush is right to stay out of the fray. ``If it had been resolved
when I proposed it, South Carolina would not be where it is today,
on display for the entire world in a very ugly way,'' says Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving it would take politicians ruled by their hearts, not
by their opinion polls. They would actually have to believe in
something other than themselves.

ADDICTIVE RUTH RENDELL PROVIDES ANOTHER FIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HARM DONE 
By Ruth Rendell 
Crown, 346 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of Ruth Rendell's work can't help wondering how she does
it. How does she turn out so many wonderful novels, sometimes two
or three a year, year after year? The woman is clearly some kind of
genius who deserves all the many honors that have come, and
continue to come, her way.
</P>
<P>
   Her novels aren't trash, far from it, but they provide the
titillating pleasure of reading trash. She's addictive. Fortunately
for readers, there's plenty to feed a Rendell addiction.
</P>
<P>
   As Barbara Vine, she's written nine creepy novels about the
criminally inclined. Under her own name, she's produced 19 offbeat
mysteries fraught with suspense and rich in psychological insight.
She's also the author of a series of police procedurals, the
Inspector Wexford novels, of which ``Harm Done'' is the 19th and
latest.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Inspector Reg Wexford is thoughtful and introspective, a
low-key, low-profile detective who quietly and steadily goes about
his job. Other crime writers trick out their heroes with all sorts
of special personal quirks, effects, and flourishes. In Wexford,
Rendell has created an ordinary, decent man who struggles with
self-doubt. He's likable and believable.
</P>
<P>
   Through the novels, as Wexford and his family have aged and
developed into familiar characters, the Sussex town of Kingsmarkham
has changed, reflecting changes in contemporary Britain, and in the
larger world, too. ``Harm Done'' reveals, among other problems,
domestic abuse, pedophilia, kidnapping, mob violence, class
conflict, unemployment, petty crime, and, of course, murder. Two
murders, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Wexford's elder daughter Sylvia, a social worker, has begun
working at The Hide, a beleaguered refuge for battered women and
their children. Sylvia's own marriage is in trouble, although
domestic abuse is not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away from The Hide, an elderly pedophile named
Thomas Orbe, just released from prison, has come to live at the
town's low-income housing project with his daughter and her
boyfriend. The neighbors, fearful for their children, are furious
and threatening violence if Orbe doesn't leave. Wexford is involved
in the touchy job of protecting the child molester from harm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two teenage girls have disappeared, one after
another, prompting massive searches and televised pleas from their
anguished parents. The first, the mentally challenged Lizzie
Cromwell, turns up at home and refuses to talk about what's
happened to her. The second, a surly college student, Rachel
Holmes, also returns home and can't be persuaded to talk about
where she's been.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman police officer, Karen Malahyde, takes it upon
herself to try to solve the abductions by posing as a hitchhiker.
She also disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Then a 3-year-old girl vanishes from her home in one of
Kingsmarkham's toniest neighborhoods, a development that fuels mob
frenzy against Thomas Orbe. Subsequently the girl's father, one of
Kingsmarkham's most prosperous citizens, is found stabbed to death
in his study.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there's a lot going on in ``Harm Done,'' much of it
inspired by news headlines. Rendell's treatment of issues such as
domestic abuse and vigilante justice are perceptive, but issues
aren't what drive this novel. Rendell's characters, even her minor
creations, are, as always, drawn in insightful detail. The
egregious, scheming editor of the local newspaper. The pathetic
petty crook who pushes his little daughter through cat-flaps so she
can burglarize houses. The snotty college girl Rachel Holmes.
Wexford's cranky daughter Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   The various plot lines don't tie up neatly, to the author's
credit. Certain situations remain unresolved. That's life, and life
inspires interesting fiction. ``Harm Done'' is not Rendell at her
very best, i.e., superb, but fans of the Wexford books will be
pleased. Many readers will solve at least one of the murders long
before the truth is revealed. But figuring out the mystery is never
the main point, or the main pleasure, of reading a novel by Ruth
Rendell.

`SUGAR' SWEETENS ARMENIAN BAND'S STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lighting up rock radio lately _ and touring with just about
everyone in sight _ is System of a Down, which is also the first
Armenian rock act to have a national impact. There have been
individual Armenian stars before _ pop diva Cher is half-Armenian _
but ``I don't recall any Armenian heavy-metal bands besides us,''
says System's songwriter/guitarist, Daron Malakian.
</P>
<P>
   The group has exploded with ``Sugar,'' a thrashy tune that
combines performance-art wailing with manic guitar bursts and
lyrics about an alienated youth who feels no one is listening to
him. It's a common subject for rock radio, but the song is played
with such intensity that it stands way above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go with our feelings in whatever we do. We want to get all
our emotions across,'' says Malakian, 24, whose Los Angeles-based
group headlines the Sno-Core Tour (with Incubus, Mr. Bungle, and
Puya).
</P>
<P>
   System of a Down has gained further respect _ and boosted
Armenian pride _ through the song ``P.L.U.C.K.,'' which stands for
``Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowardly Killers.'' It's about the
killing of a reported 1.5 million Armenians by Turkish troops in
1915. ``The plan was mastered and called genocide,'' System's Serj
Tankian sings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be pigeonholed as a political band,'' adds
Malakian, ``but we know that a lot of people don't even know who
Armenians are, so we try to tell them in a couple of songs. We also
do a lot of other kinds of songs _ from love songs to a song about
suicide _ but we felt we had to say something about the genocide.
It's been covered up in a lot of history books.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reaction from the Armenian community, Malakian says,
``A lot of the younger kids appreciate the music _ and a lot of the
older people appreciate the messages.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a coincidence, though, that all four band members are
Armenian. They attended the same private Armenian Christian school
_ the Alex Pilybos School in Hollywood _ but weren't friends then
because their different ages (ranging from 24 to 32) put them in
separate classes. They only got together because their earlier
bands shared the same rehearsal studio.
</P>
<P>
   Malakian had been a singer who wanted to focus on guitar, while
Tankian was a keyboardist who wanted to sing. So they teamed up and
were soon augmented by Odadjian (who used to hang out at the
studio) and Dolmayan, who replaced another drummer who didn't work
out. The name System of a Down was chosen after Malakian suggested
Victims of a Down (the title of a poem he wrote). The band balked
at the victim image, so he modified it and the new name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's been easy since. System of a Down's self-titled
debut album (produced by Rick Rubin, who has worked with the
Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers) came out in June of 1998,
but went nowhere until the group started touring relentlessly. The
band has been on the last two Ozzfests and opened a tour for Limp
Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now has all been through touring. The radio
thing just happened recently,'' says Malakian. ``But we don't write
specifically for radio. This band will never bow down to any
formulas.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has diverse influences, from Malakian's love of
Twisted Sister, Iggy Pop, and Slayer, to Tankian's occasional
fondness for lighter acts like Charles Aznavour and Chris DeBurgh.
``When we put it all together, it comes out as System of a Down,''
says Malakian.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sno-Core tour, System will get down to making a new
album, but for now, the band is still enjoying the road. ``I can
tell you one thing,'' he says. ``You aren't going to get bored on a
night with us, Mr. Bungle, Incubus, and Puya. You'll get something
different from every band.''

   Punk legend remembered: Sad news from New York. Helen Wheels,
lead singer of the punk/hard rock band of the same name, died
Tuesday. She had been in an Ithaca hospital for an operation to
insert a metal implant in her spine. An infection apparently set in
and she slipped into a coma and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something went terribly wrong,'' said her friend and singer
Snooky Bellomo, who co-owns Manic Panic, an alternative cosmetics
and hair-color wholesaler. Wheels had just done a photo shoot for
the Manic Panic catalog. Says Bellomo: ``She didn't have a mean
bone in her body. She was so nice and cool and supportive of
everyone.'' Wheels, 50, also coauthored the Blue Oyster Cult
classic ``Tattoo Vampire'' and discovered the Dictators by hiring
them as her backup band.

'60S ICON SANTANA TOPS THE MUSIC CHARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when teenagers often rule the trend-driven music
world, the most unlikely current king of the charts is 52-year-old
Carlos Santana _ the original Woodstock hippie who scored the
hottest Top 40 hit of the past year, while earning 10 Grammy
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting from recent Grammy coverage leading to the Feb. 23
event for which he's the sentimental favorite to sweep the awards,
Santana's album, ``Supernatural,'' sold 204,000 copies this week
and shot back to No. 1 on the charts. It outdistanced Britney
Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and the other cuties on the airwaves.
The album has sold 6 million copies since its release last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have really grooved to this record and I don't think
it's going to stop,'' says Lisa Goren, who manages the HMV store in
Cambridge, Mass., where Santana's album is also No. 1. ``As an
older person, I'm glad he's getting this attention, and it's not
just going to teens and rappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana's return from near oblivion is due in part to his solid
base of support among baby boomers who remember the '60s and '70s,
as well as to his smartly timed plan to ask new-generation artists
to perform on his album, including Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, Dave
Matthews, Everlast, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Mana. They helped
give it a contemporary edge that rescued Santana from his old-time
classic-rock niche. And, in a year that saw Ricky Martin take the
Latin music scene to a mainstream mania, Santana has made his
comeback virtually without the support of Latin radio, despite five
tracks on the CD in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's textbook the way it all came together,'' says Richard
Palmese, senior vice president of Santana's label, Arista Records.
``You go to radio and it works there. Then you go into the stores
and it sells. Then the critics give you their support, then MTV and
VH1. Everybody has been on board. It's been an amazing campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana's talent is not to sing, but to play guitar with a
trademark passion that hasn't waned since his Haight-Ashbury days.
Born in Autlan de Navarro, Mexico (the son of a mariachi musician),
he was raised in Tijuana and San Francisco, where he was washing
dishes in a fast-food restaurant when the Grateful Dead pulled up
and the band's guitarist Jerry Garcia, upon hearing of his musical
interest, encouraged him to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia became a mentor (``he'd show me all kinds of things on
the guitar,'' Santana once said), but Santana also listened to
everyone from Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton (who plays on the
``Supernatural'' album) to Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Bob Marley,
John Coltrane, Tito Puente, and, especially, African musician Baba
Olatunji.
</P>
<P>
   Santana came from an era of drug experimentation _ and has
acknowledged being on acid when playing at Woodstock '69 _ but soon
stopped using drugs and became a devout spiritual seeker and
meditator. He also eschews limousines and still travels with his
band as ``one of the fellas,'' says his longtime keyboardist,
Chester Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's recent success _ which rivals any achieved by boomer
peers Bonnie Raitt, Cher, Elton John, and Rod Stewart in the '90s _
was jump-started by the Top 40 single, ``Smooth,'' a collaboration
between Santana and Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. Santana chose
Thomas's song ``because I believe that guy, I like the honesty of
his voice,'' Thomas recalls Santana saying.
</P>
<P>
   The first Top 40 station in the country to play the song was
Boston's ``Kiss 108'' (WXKS-FM, 107.9). ``Carlos hadn't been on the
radio in a long time. I can't remember ever being approached about
a Carlos Santana song,'' says the station's program director John
Ivey. ``When (Arista) brought the record to us, they said, `Look,
we don't know what we've got here.' But when my music director,
David Corey, and I listened to it, we knew it was going to be a
smash. And it's still holding. We've probably had 2,000 spins on it
at this point _ and listeners just aren't tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have any of the elements that burn out listeners _
it doesn't have too catchy a hook and isn't too glitzy,'' says
Ivey. ``And it's not in-your-face. It's just a great song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos is almost like a mythical figure,'' Thomas says by
phone from New York. ``I'm 27 years old and I pinch myself when I
think that I just worked with Santana. I'm ecstatic. And mine was
the last song to get on the record, so that makes it even more
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says Santana worked quickly in the studio (``we did maybe
two takes of the song'') and was a joy to work with in the
accompanying video _ a live clip shot in the streets of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The band wouldn't stop playing!'' Thomas says, recalling last
summer's videotaping. ``It was 98 degrees out there, but Carlos and
the band and the extras just kept going, even when the cameras
stopped. Everybody was sweating like a pig except for Carlos, who
was cool as can be, in his suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana isn't talking these days, because his spokesman said he
agreed to do an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone in exchange
for a cover piece before the Grammys. But members of his entourage
aren't so tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't get a chance to take the ride we're
on,'' says keyboardist Thompson. ``And the main motivation for
Carlos on this album was to reach young people, especially at a
time when you have gangs and a lot of violence. He saw it as an
opportunity, because he has three young ones himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos wanted to be on the airwaves and be contemporary
again,'' says producer K. C. Porter, who produced several tracks
and wrote one of them (``Primavera''). ``I worried about there
being too many guests on the record,'' adds Porter, ``but amid all
the diversity, Carlos provides the common link.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a loving, generous guy with a great family and that all
comes out in his music,'' says former Grateful Dead percussionist
Mickey Hart about his friend. ``He honors his ancestors and
understands that people came before him and plowed the way. And the
young people he played with look up to him as a kind of
godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana's former manager _ the legendary Bay Area promoter Bill
Graham _ encouraged him to collaborate with more young artists, but
while Santana tried it to some degree in the past, he wasn't ready
to fully plunge in until recently, says Hart. ``It's just a time of
Carlos's life when he can let go. Sometimes you don't take
directions when you're young, but you can take them when you're
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Santana had some early Top 40 hits _ including ``Evil
Ways,'' ``Oye Como Va'' and a cover of Fleetwood Mac's ``Black
Magic Woman'' _ he hasn't had a radio hit since 1982. He has
survived most of the past three decades by touring, not through
record sales and certainly not by winning Grammys (he's had only
one Grammy his entire career).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very astute businessman when it comes to touring,''
says Dave Marsden, vice president of Cambridge's Don Law Co. ``He's
had some of the most intelligently packaged tours in the business.
He has shared bills with Bob Dylan, Jeff Beck, and had Phish open
for him when they got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, although Santana is originally from Mexico and has
five songs in Spanish on his hit album, the only key radio stations
that haven't gotten behind the disc are Latin stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to play him in the '70s and early '80s,'' says Tony
Molina, a DJ with Boston's WRCA-AM. (1330). ``But since then, the
main rhythms that have taken over the Latin market are salsa,
merengue, and bachata _ especially salsa _ and Carlos doesn't
really fit into those. I buy all of his records and listen to them
at home, but as far as airplay, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else, it seems, the Santana express seems
unstoppable. And the prime result of it has been to break down the
ageism that exists in the pop world. ``People get very ageist in
popular music,'' says Billboard editor Timothy White. ``But the
wonderful thing about Carlos's album is that no one seems to care
how old he is. You certainly don't hear it in his playing.''

HARBISON PREPARES `GATSBY' FOR CHICAGO REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ John Harbison's ``The Great Gatsby'' ended
its eight-performance run at the Metropolitan Opera last weekend.
The work came in for a mixed press, but the performances were sold
out, and on the last night, Harbison found himself in standing
room, having offered his seat to a colleague in opera-writing,
Nicholas Maw. Harbison remarked he enjoyed ``the quality of
attention'' in standing room.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation in his home here early this week, Harbison
said he has a few ``targets'' in his score he wants to work on
before ``Gatsby's'' first revival at the Chicago Lyric Opera in
October. ``I want to shorten the overture a little bit, by a couple
of minutes _ there's a difference between a concert overture, where
there is no expectation of another dimension to come, and a theater
overture. I also want to make some adjustments in the last scene of
the first act, which culminates in the big love duet between Gatsby
and Daisy. What I think I will resist is the suggestion some have
made that I turn this into a three-act opera. I know the last scene
in the first act has to build up again from the climax of Gatsby's
aria in the third scene, but that's what the narrative is doing at
that point; longing becomes reality, but not the reality Gatsby is
expecting and that can't go fast. Also the one major time-gap in
the narrative coincides with the current intermission.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbison says the other changes he plans are minor and deal with
detail rather than with substance. But he doesn't plan to
``correct'' everything. ``One thing can assert its right to engulf
everything else at a climactic moment; that's a legitimate aspect
of expression _ I have to tell that to well-trained young
chamber-musicians all the time.'' (There was a moment at the climax
of the love duet when one wished Dawn Upshaw and Jerry Hadley had
been replaced by Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner, although one can
hardly imagine Heppner in Gatsby's pink suit, or Eaglen in one of
Upshaw's silky flapper outfits).
</P>
<P>
   Harbison says he hasn't read most of the reviews of ``Gatsby,''
but he does know that many of them were negative, dismissive and
patronizing. ``I just try to focus on the model set by Siskel &AMP;
Ebert, which showed us that intelligent people can witness the same
thing and not agree about it.''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't exactly call Haribson thick-skinned. But he
cheerfully admits he has ``had some training'' for this kind of
drubbing _ and, of course, when it comes to Met premieres, he finds
himself in good company; new operas by Stravinsky and Barber were
ritually slaughtered in the press. ``My Oboe Concerto was
unanimously dismissed in San Francisco, but it has gone on to its
own life. I remember sitting near Stravinsky when `The Rake's
Progress' was done at Santa Fe in 1963 and hearing him say, `Why
doesn't anyone like this piece?' and all I could think of, was `My
God, this is Stravinsky.' I have been buoyed by the very strong
response on the part of my musical colleagues, who have shown up,
weighed in, and made some very valuable comments. A lot of
wonderful pieces have thorns in them but they somehow make contact
with musicians, and because of that, they prevail. No opera of our
time had a rougher ride when it was new than Sir Michael Tippett's
`The Midsummer Marriage,' but that opera has the capacities of a
long-distance runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbison isn't sure what his next opera will be, but hopes there
will be another. ``It was my childhood ambition to write operas. I
listened to the Texaco Met broadcasts and built my own little
theater where I performed my first opera, `David and Bathsheba.'
Opera was more intensely real to me than anything else in my life.
My ambition to be an opera composer was to a large extent deflected
by circumstances, but one result of `Gatsby' is that I know I don't
want to retire from this field. Opera is in a very strong position
now in a culture that has become more and more visual in
orientation; opera has benefited in a way that the concert world
hasn't. Opera reaches people on a level that nothing else does.''

FLAGPOLE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It just came to me what the ``W'' stands for in George W. Bush:
``Wheeeeeeee!!!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of a politician who's just promised everyone a
tax cut. Any hedge or qualification of that, Gov'nor? No?
``Everybody gets a tax cut,'' says Boy George. Whee!
</P>
<P>
   Promise-them-anything-but-give-them-a-tax-tantalizer is a strand
of DNA that runs deep in the Bush dynasty gene pool. Remember
``Read-my-lips-no-new-taxes''? Ring a bell? Breaking that pledge
cost George Sr. heavily eight years ago; he lost New Hampshire and
New England to the Clinton-Gore Express. Ex-President Read-My-Lips
is now back campaigning for his eldest son. And the apple doesn't
fall far from the tax-talk tree.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded from the right by antitaxer Steve Forbes, Bush Jr.
whistled up a huge tax giveaway. Right, said his Texas braintrust.
Tax cuts for everybody. Coming right up. We take $483 billion in
tax revenue the government will take over the next five years, and
give it back as tax cuts. Over 10 years, that'd be $1.3 trillion.
We run by promising everybody money! Is that great or what? Who can
say no to free money?
</P>
<P>
   The Stop-Boy-George crowd reacted predictably. Forbes, who has
an M.O. of knocking GOP rivals with late-stage TV ads, runs spots
accusing Bush Jr. of breaking a no-tax-hike pledge in Texas, which
pledge George W. did break, sort of, en route to signing some
different tax cuts passed by his tax-phobic Legislature. Bush's tax
cut giveaway is slammed by Senator John McCain, who's neck-and-neck
with Bush in New Hampshire, as irresponsible and titled unfairly to
reward the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The gutsy McCain had the temerity to point out that Bush's
scheme is a giveaway to the wealthy. That leaves Governor `Dubbaya'
scratching his noggin, muttering ``What's wrong with that?'' The
Bush camp is trying to smash McCain's campaign with New Hampshire
TV spots claiming the Arizonan would tax your fringe benefits at
work. False, shouts McCain, and allies like former Senator Warren
Rudman, a New Hampshire icon.
</P>
<P>
   When it gets down to the final strokes in New Hampshire, the
Bush Gang has a track record of low blows on the tax issue. Twelve
years ago, Bush Sr. staged a come-from-behind surge against Bob
Dole with some misleading TV attack ads castigating Dole as
``Senator Straddle.'' High times often follow low blows in
politics. As Bush Sr. savored his make-or-break New Hampshire
victory over the crestfallen Dole on NBC, Tom Brokaw mischeviously
inquired if Dole had any word for Bush. ``Yeah,'' snarled Dole,
``Tell him to stop lying about my record.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's a different Bush locked in a close tussle in New
Hampshire, but the tactic is the same. ``Governor Bush is purposely
misrepresenting my tax plan,'' says McCain, whose scheme would cut
taxes by half of Bush's target, tilt the breaks to low and
middle-income people, and use the remaining budget surplus to save
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Class warfare,'' snorts Bush, and his cheerleaders in the
right wing media combine. If only the proles would stop squirming,
the rich could simply put their boot on the proletariat's neck, and
we could get on with it, in the natural order of things. ``Class
warfare'' is what Bush grumbles when debate turns to how come the
rich get the gravy in the Bush scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational tug here. McCain is 63; his hair is
gone white, thanks to a little assist from those crazy guys at the
Hanoi Hilton, and John gets more of the vote of veterans and the
oldsters than Bush, the Boomer Boy candidate, who came to cherish
tax breaks for box seats as a baseball owner. Bush gets a younger,
more affluent vote; his boomers like tax breaks for box seats.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is used to seducers dangling tax cuts under the
noses of primary voters. Bill Clinton dangled $300 per year per
middle-income family in '88, prompting Paul Tsongas to waggle his
finger at ``Pander Bear,'' an election-year tax cut pleader.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts have actually diminished as a vote trigger, if you
accept the polls. This Clinton-Gore economy is so strong, incomes
so high, that the economic insecurity that destroyed Bush Sr. in
1988 now barely flickers. Old houses clad in peeling paint eight
years ago have two fresh coats of latex now. Banks are not failing,
they are flailing, trying to sell new products to a newly
prosperous New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains a core of bottom-line voters to whom the
promise of tax cuts is as seductive as gin to a toper. It is so
much hogwash, natch. Bush vows spending billions more on the
military, pricey new Star Wars gizmos, to make schools better,
bolster Social Security and Medicare, and do all this while
forgoing a trillion bucks in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Use your bean: Can that be done? Of course not. There's nothing
like a trillion or a half-trillion in ``waste, fraud, and
corruption,'' the usual suspects cited by tax-cutters when their
numbers don't add up. But, read their lips: As Bush &AMP; Bush learned
early, just because you don't mean it doesn't mean you can't say
it, as long as it works.

   CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ The grandmothers of 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez -- after much trepidation -- are on their way to New
York City to begin a high-profile international public relations

   BEIRUT _ Will Israel withdraw from all of the Syrian Golan
Heights? Not part of it. Not one third this year and another third
next year. But all of it _ and at once?
</P>
<P>
   This is the only question which stands between a peace treaty
and a state of continued belligerency for Syrian President Hafez
el-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Last time this simple equation was presented to the Americans,
six years ago, CNN announced that President Assad had thrown ``a
spanner in the works'' of the peace process _ as if the demand for
the return of internationally-recognized Syrian territory was an
act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, still adhering to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 and
still insisting upon the return of all Golan _ with its precious
water sources _ President Assad is accused by Israelis of
``intransigence.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the old cliches are being trotted out. When Farouk
al-Sharaa, Assad's soigne foreign minister _ the impeccably-groomed
former head of Syrian Arab Airlines _ met the Israelis at the
Shepherdstown talks in West Virginia, we were informed that the
``peace process'' was ``back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment al-Sharaa presented the Americans and Israelis
with Syria's 34-year-old demand for a return of all Golan, the
world was told that Syria was ``playing hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't Syria ``compromise?'' Why not an Israeli-Syrian
peace first, and an Israeli military withdrawal afterwards? Why not
allow the Jewish settlers on Golan to remain on Syrian land? And
why not an Israeli military early-warning station on the Heights to
guard against a surprise Syrian assault?
</P>
<P>
   No suggestion, you may notice, of a Syrian early warning station
to guard against Israeli attack.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that the Syrians decided to postpone, ``sine
die,'' the talks which U.S. President Bill Clinton would like to
crown his ``peacemaking'' presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Publication by the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz of the U.S.
working-paper on the negotiations shows that the Syrians had
already agreed to substantial arrangements on a post-withdrawal
peace, including bilateral trade and tourism, open frontiers and an
exchange of ambassadors _ even before a commitment on Golan
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis still want to ``compromise'' on that retreat.
And the Syrians, after watching the humiliation of PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, won't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, from the Arab perspective, is it difficult to see why. The
PLO leader, dazed by the sudden respect of his American enemies and
humbled by the apparent willingness of Israel to give him a state,
agreed to a treaty which he fondly believed would be ``a peace of
the brave.''
</P>
<P>
   What he got _ and the Syrians watched this theatre of the absurd
with increasing rage _ was a Bantustan: a desiccated Palestinian
``entity'' without borders or rights, an Israeli refusal of an Arab
capital in any part of Jerusalem, the enlargement of Jewish
settlements on Palestinian land, and the refusal to accept any 1948
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Assad therefore sent al-Sharaa to Virginia with strict
instructions to avoid the Arafat trap.
</P>
<P>
   Golan, captured during the 1967 Six-Day War, was Syrian. There
would be no compromise, no future agreements based on present
trust, no timetabled withdrawals which the Israelis could delay or
abrogate as they have on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A close reading of the American working-paper _ leaked by the
Israelis to the indignation of the pro-Israeli Americans _ shows
that both Syria and Israel are still in dispute over the total
Golan Heights land area which was illegally annexed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants a withdrawal to the boundary existing on June 4,
1967, at the start of the Middle East Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   This conforms to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 which
calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from land taken during
the war, in return for the security of all states (including
Israel) in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians are now archly demanding that the Americans
``guarantee'' the Israeli withdrawal and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright _ who usually sounds like an Israeli
spokesperson on such matters _ has predictably replied that America
can act as a ``substitute'' for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Few doubt that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would like to
get out of Golan _ without such a withdrawal there can be no
peaceful Israeli retreat from the blood-spattered mire of Lebanon _
but the Americans, as usual, prefer to play the role of lamb when
Israeli interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's domestic opposition appears to be growing. But one thing
Assad doesn't have to worry about _ with his nine separate internal
security agencies _ is internal opposition. &QL;

&HT;     RESEARCHERS CONSIDER `MARIJUANA PATCH' FOR PAIN RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cancer patients may one day be able to use a
``marijuana patch'' to ease the chronic pain, nausea and vomiting
associated with chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The project, funded by the American Cancer Society of New York
and New Jersey, hopes to build on the success of nicotine patches,
which deliver controlled doses of nicotine to help cigarette
smokers kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Albany College of Pharmacy will study whether
the active components of marijuana can be transmitted through the
skin in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, such a patch could help ease the suffering of
cancer patients. It might also have potential for other chronic or
terminal conditions, including AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. Studies have shown that some 60 million Americans visit
their doctor every year for pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients often refer to the treatment (for cancer) as worse
than the disease,'' said Don Distasio, chief operating officer for
the American Cancer Society's Eastern Division. ``Something needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year, $361,000 grant was awarded to Audra Stinchcomb,
an assistant professor at the college, where she specializes in the
study of transmitting drugs through the skin, known as transdermal
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest challenge will be finding a way to skirt the skin's
natural defense system against foreign or toxic invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb will use the waste tissue discarded from tummy tuck
operations to measure how cannabinoids, the active ingredients in
marijuana, are absorbed through the skin, and at what rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If transdermal delivery were easy, every capsule would have a
patch,'' she said. ``The skin is a good barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb estimated it could take a decade of research and
clinical trials before a marijuana patch might be approved for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Such a patch could avoid some of the side effects of medical
marijuana cigarettes, a controversial source of pain relief that is
currently banned by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   But voters in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington state have passed initiatives legalizing
marijuana for medical use, though doctors are still reluctant to
prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the country, a synthetic form of marijuana
provides a legal option for pain relief. Yet Stinchcomb said the
pill, known as dronabinol, has limited effectiveness in very ill
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Severely nauseated patients may not be able to keep the
capsule in their stomach long enough for it to have an effect,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the
National Academy of Sciences, concluded that the active ingredients
in marijuana can ease the pain, nausea and vomiting of cancer and
AIDS.

   WASHINGTON _ Although six Republicans and two Democrats are
contesting the primaries, there are just four who are judged to
have any serious chance of winning the presidency 10 months from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most recent polls indicate that there may be only
two: Vice-President Al Gore and the Governor of Texas, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many obstacles in this knockout game of Who Wants
to be a President? These and other questions could trip any one of
them at any time between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS: Soft drugs have pretty much ceased to be an issue but
hard drugs remain a political no-no.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has admitted a drink problem in his youth and
says he has not used drugs for 25 years, but is silent on events
before that. If it emerges he did use cocaine, it could be fatal to
his prospects; if the evidence related to the past 25 years, he
would be in real difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRAFT: Of the four main contenders, only John McCain, a
professional soldier at the time, has an unimpeachable record on
the draft question.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam, but only for four months and as a
(heavily protected) reporter, suggesting a degree of special
treatment _ he was the son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Bill Bradley both met their draft requirements in the
U.S., hinting at privileged treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN: McCain has been painfully frank about his past
womanizing, blaming himself for his divorce from his first wife and
denying that his five years as a Vietnamese PoW helped to explain
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The other three all profess enduring fidelity to their wives.
But after Monica, adultery seems unlikely to rule out any
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY: McCain was absolved of any wrongdoing in a minor banking
scandal, but still reproaches himself for having allowed the
``appearance of impropriety.'' He uses the experience to illustrate
the pernicious effect of the political funding system, where big
donors may expect their candidate, once elected, to give them
special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be vulnerable if anyone demonstrates that donations
to his campaign for governor appeared to spawn special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore remains vulnerable for dubious fund-raising practices in
the 1996 election, and for the acceptance of foreign money and
fund-raising from the White House _ both against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is accused of lobbying for privileges for big
pharmaceutical companies that donated to his Senate campaigns but
there has been no suggestion of impropriety. It simply does not sit
well with his calls to end big company donations to political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   LYING: So far, none of the candidates has been caught in
anything more serious than a mild burnishing of his record (George
Bush on his tax-cutting, Al Gore on ``inventing'' the Internet,
among others).
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH: Election campaigns demand huge reserves of stamina.
Gore, Bush and McCain have furnished doctors' statements _ and
McCain most of his medical records _ to prove they are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, had to admit to a heart problem, and while
doctors say that millions of Americans suffer a similar condition _
an irregular heartbeat _ with no impairment of their capabilities,
it cast a shadow on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSIONS: Two of these potential obstacles _ drugs and the
draft _ are peculiar to the Sixties generation and were arguably
neutralized by the election of Bill Clinton, despite his admission
that he smoked (without inhaling) and despite his avoidance of the
draft that could have taken him to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Another two may have been neutralized by Clinton's sins in
office _ womanizing and lying (to the American public, if not quite
in a court of law).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Clinton presidency is thought to have ``raised the
bar'' on personal failings for future candidates and presidents,
although it is arguable that a president without Clinton's charm
and political talents would not have survived the admissions he had
to make.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. Any candidate who was proved to have
taken bribes or enriched himself from his political activities
would probably have to count himself out of the running. Dubious
fund-raising, though, does not count.
</P>
<P>
   Poor health will also eliminate a candidate, if not at the
primary stage, then in the election proper.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest liability for a candidate is undoubtedly hypocrisy.
This, not womanizing, is what felled Gary Hart. It is also what
saved Clinton: he may have lied, he was certainly disingenuous but
at no point was he seen as hypocritical. &QL;

   PARIS _ France Telecom is working on a jacket with a built-in
mobile telephone, which it hopes to issue experimentally this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker and microphone will probably be hidden in the sleeves;
front and sleeve buttons may double as keyboard push-buttons.
</P>
<P>
   There remains one small, technical problem. How do you wash or
dry-clean such a jacket or suit, without ruining the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   The research agency of France Telecom, the Centre National
d'Etudes des Telecommunications, believes that such clothes will be
all the rage in three to ten years' time. The prototype, to be
produced this summer, will help to overcome other remaining
difficulties, such as cost.
</P>
<P>
   Would the talking suit owner of the future be able to transfer
the equipment from one piece of clothing to another? Or would he or
she have an entire talking wardrobe?
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is cooperating in the research with a company
called i-wear, which specializes in the development of electronic
and telephonic clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects under consideration include clothes with
transmitters to allow the wearer to be tracked by satellite
(applicable to prisoners on parole or unfaithful husbands?).
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term ideas include: sports clothes which measure speed
and distance; evening wear which changes color when it is subjected
to bright lights or loud music; and overcoats capable of checking
their own pockets to make sure that their owner has left nothing
behind. &QL;

   LONDON _ The art of stand-up comedy is the new weapon in the
battle for corporate success.
</P>
<P>
   Jongleurs, a British comedy-club chain, is offering lessons to
executives who think that a sense of humor might give them a
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Kempinska, Jongleurs' co-founder, said modern bosses are
discovering that there is more to comedy than knowing a few jokes.
``We're moving into an era where ideas are paramount. Stand-up just
gives you a chance to think in different terms _ how to turn words
and ideas around in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   A workshop series will be launched this month after a pilot
session by one of Jongleurs' regular comics proved a hit. Jim
Andrews, managing director of Thinc! Digital, an interactive media
business, was one of the guinea pigs and now plans to send some of
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it _ it was great fun,'' he said. ``I was a
bit tentative initially. I couldn't imagine myself standing up on a
stage with a two-minute comedy sequence. But I found it really
liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot workshop with a mixed group of professionals began
with exercises designed to encourage trust and make the
participants ``open up,'' such as mimicking walking down the road
and bumping into people.
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to writing material, taking ordinary situations
and exaggerating them to draw out the ridiculous, then performing a
routine to the rest of the group. Practicalities included learning
how to use a microphone properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of presentations to clients and you do it in a
linear way. But this made you think laterally,'' Andrews said.
``There was this mix of people who had never done anything like it
before. But by lunchtime we were all really into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies send people on challenges and adventure things
_ that's one form of exhilaration. This is another way of getting
people together and focused and excited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The session leader, Dominic Holland, a professional stand-up
comedian for eight years, said he felt quite sorry for the group
initially. ``Obviously it was terrifying. Public-speaking is
difficult anyway, but making a speech with the intention of making
folk laugh is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end, I did feel that they had enjoyed themselves
and done something they hadn't done before. It gave them a
different look, a different perspective. And they gained in
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not think any of the participants should give up
their day jobs, yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't funny, but I wouldn't expect them to be,'' he
said. ``Even Eddie Izzard is cited as being terribly unfunny for
the first year of his career.'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since the collapse of the Japanese ``bubble'' economy,
many Japanese businessmen have taken a beating, but none quite so
literally as Akira Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was the owner of a small restaurant and an
electrical business in Tokyo. But falling business and debts forced
him to seek alternative means of making money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hareruya, 36, spends his nights in Tokyo's seediest
district, Kabukicho, as Japan's first human punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   For 1,000 yen (roughly $10), anyone who wishes can physically
assault him for one minute. Depending on the weather, he makes as
much as 30,000 yen ($300) a night.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evenings, just before 9 p.m., Hareruya takes up his
regular position next to a famous theatre in Kabukicho. A friend
holds the stopwatch to time the designated minute. Another helper
is on hand in case excited or over-refreshed punters get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hareruya, a former professional boxer who once ranked 17th in
Japan, dons his gloves and protective mask, and plays the recorded
message that announces his presence: ``Hit me as much as you want!
Rest assured I never hit back... Roll up, roll up.''
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour the first customer arrives, a drunk who
proves incapable of penetrating Hareruya's parrying hands. The
second man is more of a challenge _ like 90 percent of punters, he
is an amateur martial artist, keen to test his skills on a live
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first customer is the most important,'' says Hareruya.
``Once one person has done it, then everyone wants to have a go.
Sometimes I have 15 people queuing up in line.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the human punching bag works as a freelance
electrician. His current commission is a discotheque called Club T,
which he is rewiring.
</P>
<P>
   Business has never been Hareruya's strong point, hence his
disastrous accumulation of debts. ``I'm too kind, that's my
problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too generous. When it comes to business I'm just stupid,
and in the end the debts got so bad that I couldn't support my wife
and kids. The restaurant and the electrics weren't enough, so I
decided to go back to my old skill, which is boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend evenings, when the money and alcohol flow most freely,
are the busiest time of the week for the human punching bag _ one
Saturday, he took on 55 punters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stayed here all night,'' he says, ``I could get a hundred
customers. But it's impossible _ you get so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., or earlier, he retires to an all-night noodle shop to
nurse his bruises. In general, his headgear and footwork protect
him from injury, but in the space of a year he has been to hospital
twice, once with a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've only been knocked down twice, both times by martial
arts experts, and no one has ever KO'd me,'' he says, rather
proudly. ``This is the legend of Akira Hareruya: he never gives up
and he never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pay off his debts, Hareruya works seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   At first he kept his new line of work a secret from his family,
but they saw a feature about him on television. ``When my kids
found out what I was doing they cried,'' he says. ``They still cry
when I speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he lives for most of the time with a friend, and
rarely goes home. The last time he saw his wife was on their
wedding anniversary, six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday, the human punching bag received a visit from
the local police. ``They ask me if I have a permit, and obviously
I'm not going to get a permit for something like this,'' he says.
``So they ask me to leave, and I pack it in for that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police know me and, because I cooperate, they know I'm all
right. They only act when they've had a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Brazilian football team Palmeiras lost one-nil
to Manchester United in the final of the Toyota Cup, held in Tokyo.
The streets were full of football fans, some of whom patronize
Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was a good fighter,'' said Hareruya. ``Bam! Bam!
he came in hard. But he was no match for Akira Hareruya.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it rained and Hareruya stayed in. He spoke on the
phone to his wife who told him, as she always does, that they have
no money. ``I told her, `Please be patient. I will do my best.' I
told her I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to his children, who cry when they speak to him.
``Please stop this, Dad. Take care of yourself.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since the collapse of the Japanese ``bubble'' economy,
many Japanese businessmen have taken a beating, but none quite so
literally as Akira Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was the owner of a small restaurant and an
electrical business in Tokyo. But falling business and debts forced
him to seek alternative means of making money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hareruya, 36, spends his nights in Tokyo's seediest
district, Kabukicho, as Japan's first human punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   For 1,000 yen (roughly $10), anyone who wishes can physically
assault him for one minute. Depending on the weather, he makes as
much as 30,000 yen ($300) a night.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evenings, just before 9 p.m., Hareruya takes up his
regular position next to a famous theatre in Kabukicho. A friend
holds the stopwatch to time the designated minute. Another helper
is on hand in case excited or over-refreshed punters get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hareruya, a former professional boxer who once ranked 17th in
Japan, dons his gloves and protective mask, and plays the recorded
message that announces his presence: ``Hit me as much as you want!
Rest assured I never hit back... Roll up, roll up.''
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour the first customer arrives, a drunk who
proves incapable of penetrating Hareruya's parrying hands. The
second man is more of a challenge _ like 90 percent of punters, he
is an amateur martial artist, keen to test his skills on a live
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first customer is the most important,'' says Hareruya.
``Once one person has done it, then everyone wants to have a go.
Sometimes I have 15 people queuing up in line.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the human punching bag works as a freelance
electrician. His current commission is a discotheque called Club T,
which he is rewiring.
</P>
<P>
   Business has never been Hareruya's strong point, hence his
disastrous accumulation of debts. ``I'm too kind, that's my
problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too generous. When it comes to business I'm just stupid,
and in the end the debts got so bad that I couldn't support my wife
and kids. The restaurant and the electrics weren't enough, so I
decided to go back to my old skill, which is boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend evenings, when the money and alcohol flow most freely,
are the busiest time of the week for the human punching bag _ one
Saturday, he took on 55 punters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stayed here all night,'' he says, ``I could get a hundred
customers. But it's impossible _ you get so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., or earlier, he retires to an all-night noodle shop to
nurse his bruises. In general, his headgear and footwork protect
him from injury, but in the space of a year he has been to hospital
twice, once with a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've only been knocked down twice, both times by martial
arts experts, and no one has ever KO'd me,'' he says, rather
proudly. ``This is the legend of Akira Hareruya: he never gives up
and he never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pay off his debts, Hareruya works seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   At first he kept his new line of work a secret from his family,
but they saw a feature about him on television. ``When my kids
found out what I was doing they cried,'' he says. ``They still cry
when I speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he lives for most of the time with a friend, and
rarely goes home. The last time he saw his wife was on their
wedding anniversary, six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday, the human punching bag received a visit from
the local police. ``They ask me if I have a permit, and obviously
I'm not going to get a permit for something like this,'' he says.
``So they ask me to leave, and I pack it in for that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police know me and, because I cooperate, they know I'm all
right. They only act when they've had a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Brazilian football team Palmeiras lost one-nil
to Manchester United in the final of the Toyota Cup, held in Tokyo.
The streets were full of football fans, some of whom patronize
Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was a good fighter,'' said Hareruya. ``Bam! Bam!
he came in hard. But he was no match for Akira Hareruya.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it rained and Hareruya stayed in. He spoke on the
phone to his wife who told him, as she always does, that they have
no money. ``I told her, `Please be patient. I will do my best.' I
told her I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to his children, who cry when they speak to him.
``Please stop this, Dad. Take care of yourself.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Cathee Shultz doesn't have a normal healthy
interest in death. She is, you might say, a little obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   She corresponds with serial killers. She collects autopsy
photographs of car wreck victims. She has a dead Afghan for a pet
dog (stuffed, of course).
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, death has also _ if you'll pardon the
expression _ been her livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Together with her artist husband, J.D. Healy, she has run a
creepy little outfit called the Museum of Death, offering a
showcase for such collected spoils as antique mortician's tools,
Charles Manson's baseball bat, an electric chair specially
constructed for a cover photo on Death Row Magazine, and a montage
of body bags in every color of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall thing is to make people happy to be alive,''
Shultz likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Until Halloween night last year the museum was based in a former
mortuary in the heart of downtown San Diego _ a rather offbeat
attraction among the trendy bars and restaurants of the city's
heavily renovated Gaslamp Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was a particularly creepy mortuary, one that
coexisted for a long time with a brothel up on the next floor, and
one where a former employee, still believed to haunt the premises,
committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, the bullet
popping out of an eye and lodging in the roof beams.
</P>
<P>
   Until Halloween, Shultz and Healy went about their business and
as only they know how. They were in negotiations to buy a Bible
belonging to Andrew Cunanan, the gay serial killer best known as
the man who bumped off Gianni Versace.
</P>
<P>
   They kept an eye out for possible additions to their Freak Farm,
a display of deformed animals, both living and dead, including an
eight-legged piglet and a two-headed turtle they call Heckle and
Jeckle.
</P>
<P>
   But then something a little unexpected happened. Not quite a
bump in the night, although there certainly were a few knocks on
the door. Something that some of the more uneasy members of the San
Diego community might have said they had coming to them. Or maybe
it was sheer bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the autumn, Shultz had been looking forward to an
auction of items from the Heaven's Gate suicide cult, the 39 people
who became convinced that the Hale-Bopp comet of a couple of years
ago was calling them to heaven and promptly did away with
themselves in a large house in the San Diego suburbs by overdosing
on barbiturates sweetened with vodka and apple sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz and Healy already owned a few choice items from the
tragedy _ various pairs of Nike sneakers, a collection of purple
shrouds, a bottle of phenobarbital and a small container of apple
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, they were hoping to bid for one of the 19 bunk
beds where the cult members perished. (They eventually bought a
white one for $130).
</P>
<P>
   In her enthusiasm, Shultz talked to various journalists about
her plans for a special Heaven's Gate exhibit, complete with male
and female mannequins mimicking the cult's black uniforms and
``Away Team'' patches.
</P>
<P>
   And that was where the problem began.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity reached the ear of the museum building's
proprietors just as they was contemplating a sale to take advantage
of the Gaslamp Quarter's rising prices. And they were not at all
sure a Museum of Death generated the right kind of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a number of comments from various different people
that this occupancy in the building was detracting from its
value,'' John Day, a partner in the company that owns the building,
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And so Shultz and Healy were evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Being positive, forward-thinking people, it wasn't long before
they had an alternative game plan. Where could a self-respecting
Museum of Death move to? There was, of course, only one answer: to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Jan. 1, in the shell of a defunct Mexican restaurant
on Hollywood Boulevard, the museum was resurrected. Being in
Hollywood, it is naturally bigger and better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz is friends with Kenneth Anger, author of the definitive
scandal catalogue ``Hollywood Babylon,'' and hopes to up the
celebrity death element quite considerably, though she is not
revealing specifics for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one might think of the tastefulness of it all, the
ghoulish couple cannot be accused of lacking a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Although only in their mid-30s, they already have plans for
their own demise. Shultz wants to be mummified and put on display
in her own museum. Healy wants to be pickled in a jar of
formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   As Shultz says: ``You need to shock people to get their
attention in our society. Death isn't bad. We all do it.'' &QL;

their own demise. Shultz wants to be mummified and put on display

   JERUSALEM _ When it comes to turf, Israelis are usually good
with maps, knowing precisely where to pinpoint the battle lines and
disputed occupation zones. But here's a place that they are not so
sure about.
</P>
<P>
   Some say its inhabitants live on a flat stretch along the
Mediterranean coast running north from Tel Aviv to Herzliya. Others
say it is a long, thin triangle, which stretches out from these
centers up into the soft slopes of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They are, perhaps, both right. For ``Silicon Wadi,'' as it is
called, is not so much about geography, as an economic phenomenon _
namely, the evolution of Israel's high-tech industry to become
second only to the Californian valley after which it is named.
</P>
<P>
   The computer high-tech industry in Israel is on fire, fueled by
a stream of well-educated young recruits, equipped with expertise
from time spent in the Israeli army's intelligence or its
engineering corps, and aided by a tide of venture capital, drawn in
by the whiff of crisp new cyber-dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A collection of mouth-watering rags-to-squillions
stories.
</P>
<P>
   For example: when it was founded in 1991 CommTouch, an e-mail
services company, comprised three people operating out of a
farmstead north of Tel Aviv; today it is a public company, with 200
employees, and a valuation of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder, Nahum Shafman, 52 _ whose career has taken him from
Israel army paratrooper, university lecturer, and programmer to
multimillionaire entrepreneur _ went on to set up another company,
``DealTime.com,'' an electronic commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than two years old, it has already 100 employees
and has nailed $25 million in venture capital. In November it
expanded to the UK and elsewhere in Europe. ``This is only the
beginning,'' Shafman says.
</P>
<P>
   This performance is more than matched by Check Point Software,
founded six years ago by three young men who, fresh out of military
intelligence, began by getting together in their basement near Tel
Aviv for brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a Internet security company, which is in the top
80 of the world's largest software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mirabilis, whose instant message Internet chat
system was founded by four hippy-ish young men in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 _ after its ICQ site had become the first most visited
Internet Web site (after Yahoo! Netscape and Microsoft), they sold
to America Online for $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   AOL was not sure whether it would make any profits from this
acquisition; it did know, though, that ICQ had what the trade calls
``eyeballs'' _ namely 12 million users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis have compensated for the country's small size,
hostile surroundings, and intense atmosphere with an incredible
propensity for travel,'' marvelled the Jerusalem Post at the time.
``The borderless anonymity of the Internet has been another natural
outlet for Israeli wanderlust.''
</P>
<P>
   The more fertile the Silicon Wadi has become, the more money it
has attracted, generating still more start-ups, still more shekels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, there was only one venture capital company in
Israel,'' said Michael Eisenberg, of Israel Seed Partners in
Jerusalem. ``Getting in to see them was like climbing Mount
Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, venture capitalists have flocked in,
bees to the techno-honeypot.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have invested some $300 million in Israeli
high-tech companies. ``And we are going up, up, up,'' said
Eisenberg, ``We have huge amounts to go.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Some of Israel's aptitude for computers has been put to more
exotic use than the mere pursuit of lucre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Nir Zigdon, 14, a schoolboy from Tel Aviv, became an
Israeli hero after wiping out an Iraqi site on the Internet,
claiming it contained ``horrible statements about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so by sending the Iraqis an e-mail in which he claimed to
be a Palestinian who had produced a virus that could wipe out
Israeli Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This idea so appealed to the Iraqis _ or, so the story goes in
Israel _ that they were lured into opening an infected electronic
attachment which young Nir had sent with his message. This
contained a site-gobbling virus.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his exploits even overshadowed those of another
brilliant young Israeli cyber-delinquent _ 18-year-old Ehud
Tenenbaum, otherwise known as The Analyzer _ who sparked a
worldwide FBI hunt by hacking a path into the Pentagon, NASA, and
the U.S. Navy's research center on submarine warfare. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The house on Caine Street is no ordinary B and
B. It is not on any San Francisco accommodation agency's list. It
is not in an obviously touristy part of town. There is no sign
outside to advertise its services.
</P>
<P>
   Even the neighbors aren't too sure what goes on there, although
they have an idea it is pretty damn weird.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a B and B with a difference, as a few of the
house rules make clear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not carry your whips on your hips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put toys in a bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No loud screaming anywhere anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not touch another person or their toys or their slaves
unless invited.''
</P>
<P>
   As the establishment's owner, a nice-looking middle-aged lady
called Elizabeth, explains to the curious or the simply baffled, B
and B stands not for bed and breakfast _ there is no breakfast _
but for bed and bondage.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a hotel, of sorts, but one that caters
exclusively to sadomasochist fetishists.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, who come from as far afield as Germany, Switzerland
and South Africa, aren't interested so much in a good base from
which to explore the West Coast's most beautiful city (although
some of the higher rooms do boast good views).
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they come for the Gothic blood-red and purple drapes,
the S and M artwork on the walls, the regular ``scene'' parties and
_ most of all _ the house's basement dungeon with its chains,
crosses, medieval torture devices and cupboard full of sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may look like your grandmother but I'm also kinky. I'm a
sadist. I enjoy inflicting strong sensations on people,'' says
Elizabeth with a big friendly smile. ``Pain is not really bad. It's
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city as tolerant as San Francisco, that's a credo that
has to be followed with a certain discretion. Hence the house rules
_ which also forbid alcohol or drugs on the premises, nudity on the
patio, or anything else that might upset the neighbors or lead to a
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth loves what she does, but she is also determined nobody
should be coerced into doing anything they feel uncomfortable with.
In her house, rule number one is that No means No.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is: we are not threatening your lifestyle, but we
also don't want you to threaten ours. This is not for everyone. But
it hasn't been declared illegal or taxable by Uncle Sam, or not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest house, which for legal purposes operates as a private
club, has four bedrooms decked out in a variety of styles, from The
Chamber, with its dark wooden panelling, to The Penthouse, which
has a king-sized water bed and hooks all over the ceiling beams.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow wooden staircase leads down to the Dungeon, which not
only looks like the set of a kinky porn movie, it frequently serves
as the set for kinky porn movies.
</P>
<P>
   A deep-blue circular sheet is thrown over a Catherine Wheel
suspended from the ceiling by thick black chains. On the other side
of the room, an X-shaped St. Andrew's Cross bristles with hooks
where a ``dominant'' can attach his or her ``submissive'' with
fleece-lined leather handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the twice-monthly parties take place (complete
with discount scheme for regular visitors known as a Frequent
Flogger Program). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also where Elizabeth keeps her prized collection of
custom-made whips, canes and a whole host of household and
industrial objects, such as a paddle-ball bat, a wooden pizza tray,
an abalone pounder and an oversized pair of photographic developing
tongs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the toys are custom-made by such local firms as the San
Francisco Whip Company and another S and M supplier called Happy
Tails. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth herself got into the ``scene'' through her second
husband more than 20 years ago (in her first marriage, she played
the role of the traditional housewife and hated it).
</P>
<P>
   After holding parties for years, she bought the house on Caine
Street in 1992 and opened for business the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, she says, has vastly expanded the reach of the S
and M world; her own Web site, called Differences, has 3,000
subscribers from across the world. She herself ``plays'' with a
number of partners, including a Swiss doctor and a policeman from
Wyoming..
</P>
<P>
   Although hers is the world's first known S and M guesthouse, the
phenomenon is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   A fetishist couple in Seattle has opened a room in their house,
as has a professional dominant from Massachusetts with a sideline
interest in cooking gourmet breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene is getting positively upper-middle class now,''
Elizabeth muses. ``We getting gentrified, like everything else.'' &QL;

called Elizabeth, explains to the curious or the simply baffled, B
and B stands not for bed and breakfast _ there is no breakfast _
but for bed and bondage.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a hotel, of sorts, but one that caters
exclusively to sadomasochist fetishists.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, who come from as far afield as Germany, Switzerland
and South Africa, aren't interested so much in a good base from
which to explore the West Coast's most beautiful city (although
some of the higher rooms do boast good views).
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they come for the Gothic blood-red and purple drapes,
the S and M artwork on the walls, the regular ``scene'' parties and
_ most of all _ the house's basement dungeon with its chains,
crosses, medieval torture devices and cupboard full of sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may look like your grandmother but I'm also kinky. I'm a
sadist. I enjoy inflicting strong sensations on people,'' says
Elizabeth with a big friendly smile. ``Pain is not really bad. It's
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city as tolerant as San Francisco, that's a credo that
has to be followed with a certain discretion. Hence the house rules
_ which also forbid alcohol or drugs on the premises, nudity on the
patio, or anything else that might upset the neighbors or lead to a
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth loves what she does, but she is also determined nobody
should be coerced into doing anything they feel uncomfortable with.
In her house, rule number one is that No means No.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is: we are not threatening your lifestyle, but we
also don't want you to threaten ours. This is not for everyone. But
it hasn't been declared illegal or taxable by Uncle Sam, or not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest house, which for legal purposes operates as a private
club, has four bedrooms decked out in a variety of styles, from The
Chamber, with its dark wooden panelling, to The Penthouse, which
has a king-sized water bed and hooks all over the ceiling beams.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow wooden staircase leads down to the Dungeon, which not
only looks like the set of a kinky porn movie, it frequently serves
as the set for kinky porn movies.
</P>
<P>
   A deep-blue circular sheet is thrown over a Catherine Wheel
suspended from the ceiling by thick black chains. On the other side
of the room, an X-shaped St. Andrew's Cross bristles with hooks
where a ``dominant'' can attach his or her ``submissive'' with
fleece-lined leather handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the twice-monthly parties take place (complete
with discount scheme for regular visitors known as a Frequent
Flogger Program). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also where Elizabeth keeps her prized collection of
custom-made whips, canes and a whole host of household and
industrial objects, such as a paddle-ball bat, a wooden pizza tray,
an abalone pounder and an oversized pair of photographic developing
tongs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the toys are custom-made by such local firms as the San
Francisco Whip Company and another S and M supplier called Happy
Tails. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth herself got into the ``scene'' through her second
husband more than 20 years ago (in her first marriage, she played
the role of the traditional housewife and hated it).
</P>
<P>
   After holding parties for years, she bought the house on Caine
Street in 1992 and opened for business the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, she says, has vastly expanded the reach of the S
and M world; her own Web site, called Differences, has 3,000
subscribers from across the world. She herself ``plays'' with a
number of partners, including a Swiss doctor and a policeman from
Wyoming..
</P>
<P>
   Although hers is the world's first known S and M guesthouse, the
phenomenon is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   A fetishist couple in Seattle has opened a room in their house,
as has a professional dominant from Massachusetts with a sideline
interest in cooking gourmet breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene is getting positively upper-middle class now,''
Elizabeth muses. ``We getting gentrified, like everything else.'' &QL;

   PARIS _ Over 20,000 cats a year are being stolen in France, many
of them ending up as baby's shoes or luxury slippers.
</P>
<P>
   French animal lovers believe that the cat rustling is the work
of professionally organized gangs, who work in almost complete
impunity. Police say they have little time to devote to such a low
profile crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is feared that some of the cats are being stolen to provide
helpless victims to train attack dogs or to amuse their sadistic
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, it is known, are being taken for their fur. A raid
on a tannery in Deux Sevres in western France discovered 1,500 cat
skins, which were being used to make baby's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Vesgien, a cat lover who is herself a magistrate and
president of an association which campaigns for a better legal
status for pets in France and other EU countries, said: ``These
offenses are more and more common and can lead to acts of torture
and terrible acts of barbarity, even if many people seem to find
the whole thing funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move heaven and earth for a stolen car or painting but, in
these cases, nothing is done.''
</P>
<P>
   A Socialist member of parliament and veterinarian, Genevieve
Perrin-Gaillard, is to press for new tougher laws on the
identification of cats and dogs in France in an attempt to give
police and judicial authorities more weapons against pet rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1989 law, all cats and dogs have to be tattooed with
their identity before they can be sold, or given to another person,
but this law has proved impossible to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   One bereaved cat owner in Toulouse told the newspaper, Le
Figaro: ``A neighbor saw a white car stop in front of our house. A
young woman with rubber gloves caught my cat in a sheet and then
shoved it into a basket. The car drove away quickly... since then
we can only imagine the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Societe pour la Protection des Animaux _ the French
equivalent of the SPCA _ says that it has been inundated with
reports of stolen cats from all corners of France. Some have simply
strayed from home but the organization puts the number of
suspicious cases at at least 20,000 a year and rising. &QL;

   COLLECTION-MANIA (Undated) _ The tremendous popularity of
auction sites on the Internet has opened a window on a world in
which thousands of people are willing to bid for objects that even
some of the sellers previously thought were worthless. What is it
that compels people to collect? By Laurence Zuckerman. &QL;

<P>
   PRINCIPLES-CRITIQUE (Undated) _ For Stanley Fish, principle,
reason, fairness, and truth are fighting words. With the

professors in the United States when he headed Duke University's
English Department, Fish has woven together recent essays into
``The Trouble with Principle.'' A Critique. By Edward Rothstein.

<P>
   PARALYZED-DANCER (New York) _ Sidiki Conde climbs five flights
to his East Village apartment. He travels to schools and colleges
throughout the United States to teach West African traditional
music and dance. What makes all this unusual is that Conde is
paralyzed from the waist down. He dances _ and climbs those stairs
_ on his hands, his legs tucked around his body as he goes. By

   ROSENKAVALIER-OPERA-REVIEW (New York) _ The betting had been on
the voices, a trifecta of soprano thoroughbreds that could not
miss. And at the finish line there they were, neck and neck: Renee
Fleming as the Marschallin, Susan Graham as Octavian and Heidi
Grant Murphy as Sophie singing the trio that has broken the hearts
of opera lovers for almost a century. The opera, of course, was
``Der Rosenkavalier'' by Richard Strauss. Although the Metropolitan
Opera's production is 30 years old, the summoning of this much
singing talent to one stage had something fresh about it on
Thursday night. By Bernard Holland.

 &HT;    N.C. REPRESENTATIVES PETITION CLINTON FOR GREATER FLOOD RELIEF
 &HT;    ATTN: N.C. points. 600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Carolina's congressional delegation sent
President Clinton and House leaders a letter Friday asking that
victims of last year's Hurricane Floyd receive additional aid
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically, your inclusion of additional Hurricane Floyd
relief in an early emergency supplement request is critical to
meeting the most pressing needs of suffering US. citizens in areas
such as housing, agriculture and aid to coastal communities,'' said
the letters sent to Clinton, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by all 12 of the state's House members, comes
just before the second session of the 106th Congress convenes
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A planned supplemental funding package for U.S. operations in
Kosovo is seen as a good candidate for the flood aid. Funds in a
supplemental budget bill for the current fiscal year could be sent
to the state as early as June, some on Capitol Hill believe.
</P>
<P>
   The letter marks a renewal of efforts by state officials to win
substantial federal housing and farm assistance. Despite vigorous
lobbying of Congress and the White House last year, including seven
visits to the capital by Gov. Jim Hunt, many officials were
disappointed by the $2.2 billion in aid finally approved. The state
General Assembly later approved $836 million in relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``came down here and felt everybody's pain, but nothing
came later,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's letter requests no specific amount of aid. That will
come after Hunt's office finishes its analysis of the state's unmet
relief needs.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies are still tallying program needs, but should have
a figure ready by the first week of February, said Robert Carver of
the North Carolina Hurricane Floyd Redevelopment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is especially needed for long-term replacement housing
and the replacement of farm equipment and to prepare farmers for
the upcoming growing season,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.
``Agriculture is still the economic engine of eastern North
Carolina, and that is what makes the economic disaster so much
worse. It came on the heels of an already disastrous growing season
and several years of poor prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., said they expect Clinton
will ask for the money, but the representatives are not solely
banking on that request.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said she used the nine-week winter
break to talk with representatives from other states hard hit by
Hurricane Floyd to support a special relief program.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina was the state most severely hurt, but others
suffered as well,'' Clayton said. ``I think we'll have more
(representatives) than North Carolina carrying the banner this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said Republican leaders have indicated to her that they
did perceive the needs as pressing and wanted to wait for Clinton's
supplemental funding request.
</P>
<P>
   A separate program with support in the Senate is an $81 million
program to provide debt relief to tobacco, cotton and peanut
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The money was part of the fiscal 2000 budget approved by the
Senate last fall but removed in final negotiations with the House
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have assured Edwards that the money will be
included in the Senate's first appropriation bill, said Edwards
spokesman Michael Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's budget maneuvering stung the North Carolina
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed our (GOP) leadership didn't understand the
dire need of our farmers,'' Jones said. However, Jones said he
understood Hastert's worries that reopening budget discussions for
the agricultural money may have prompted a flood of special
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm right in saying this, but the leadership has gotten
a better idea of the devastation,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that while he wants Clinton to ask for supplemental
flood relief, he hopes it is not linked to funding for Kosovo or
another foreign aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my five years I have not voted for a foreign aid package,''
Jones said. ``But to help the people of eastern North Carolina I
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ``We really felt as the session wound down we started
behind the eight ball,'' Etheridge said. ``Members were so
distracted with, number one, trying to get the budget through and,
number two, trying to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, Etheridge and Jones agree the problems eastern North
Carolina faces cannot be solved with a single appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take years to get back on their feet,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond funding the immediate relief needs, Jones and Clayton
said the delegation needs to pursue money for long-term recovery
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said she wants Congress to establish a commission to
study what investments are needed to turn eastern North Carolina
into ``an economically viable region'' and to look at the region's
unmet housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government can't do it alone. but because of the
demographics, this area needs more help in securing affordable
housing and repairing and improving its infrastructure,'' she said.
``My dream is to turn this disaster into an opportunity and that
there is a redeeming grace out of all this suffering,'' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge said such a study could lay the groundwork for
providing better assistance to states in the future.

 &HT;    FREE-SPEECH ADVOCATES FRET AS AOL'S POWER GROWS
 &HT;    Eds: Originally budgeted as AOL-PRIVACY. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Jan.
23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since America Online Inc. announced plans to buy
Time Warner Inc. nearly two weeks ago, analysts have been
questioning how well the two work forces will blend, given their
clashing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   AOL executives tend to be open-collared, stock option-motivated
techies, while Time-Warner people are more buttoned-down
professionals. But the divisions run deeper than dress codes and
compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also have had very different approaches to free
speech issues. Time-Warner has made itself a champion of the First
Amendment by backing aggressive journalistic institutions,
including CNN, Time magazine and Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, AOL is known for its willingness to censor speech
among subscribers. Use the wrong words on line, and AOL will banish
you.
</P>
<P>
   With AOL chairman Steve Case now set to become chairman of the
combined enterprise, free-speech advocates are wondering whether
what they call AOL's ``Big Brother'' culture will spread throughout
the media empire and have a chilling effect on freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be attentive to the new ways that the free flow of
information can be stifled,'' said Andrew Shapiro, author of ``The
Control Revolution'' and an expert on free speech on the Internet.
``We no longer worry so much about the rogue constable using a
wooden club on the political dissident. Now censorship is more
likely to come from a corporation that wants to shape discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL argues that it was never intended to serve as a ``public
square'' for free speech. Rather, it was designed to be a ``gated
community'' where people choose to abide by certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules prohibit obscene or threatening language. AOL
monitors chat room conversations and, if it receives a complaint
from a member, may review instant messages and e-mails to determine
whether the content was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rich D'Amato said parents like the company's ability
to block unwanted efforts to ``harass, threaten or embarrass''
members. ``It's part of the appeal of AOL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all members are happy with the monitoring. For example,
last fall, AOL incurred the wrath of civil liberties advocates and
gay rights groups when it deleted the personal profile of a gay man
who described himself as a ``submissive bottom.'' AOL said that
description was ``objectionable content.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Romanello, executive director of the Washington-based
NationalGayLobby.Org, pointed out that other AOL members have
personal profiles listing hobbies such as ``killing fags.'' By
allowing such anti-gay comments, AOL makes itself a moral arbiter,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want them to be even-handed,'' he said. ``You can't be
up in arms about sex, but then say it's OK to want to kill
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this month, the gay profile controversy was typical of the
debate over AOL monitoring, with people arguing about how AOL
should draw lines, not whether the company had the right to do so.
But that's because AOL was just one of many online services. If a
member got banished from AOL, he could switch to a different
service provider to get access to the vast Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That freedom to walk away from AOL may be eroded by the proposed
merger. By acquiring Time Warner, AOL will gain control of that
company's cable systems. Those systems generally are operated as
local monopolies, and they can be used to provide much faster
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If a person could get high-speed access to the Internet only
through Time Warner wires and an AOL subscription, should such a
powerful monopoly still have the right to monitor discussions?
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T doesn't tell you what kind of conversations you are
allowed to have through its wires,'' said Jim Naureckas, editor of
the magazine Extra!, produced by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
(FAIR), a non-profit media watchdog group in New York. In coming
years, the courts or Congress may have to act to ensure that
free-speech principles are respected by AOL and other companies
offering high-speed access to the Internet through cable
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   If not, ``the people who own the wires will set the rules'' for
speech, he said. ``And we'll have to live by their rules, not by
the First Amendment.''

 &HT;    FREE-SPEECH ADVOCATES FRET AS AOL'S POWER GROWS
 &HT;    Eds: Originally budgeted as AOL-PRIVACY. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Jan.
23.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since America Online Inc. announced plans to buy
Time Warner Inc. nearly two weeks ago, analysts have been
questioning how well the two work forces will blend, given their
clashing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   AOL executives tend to be open-collared, stock option-motivated
techies, while Time-Warner people are more buttoned-down
professionals. But the divisions run deeper than dress codes and
compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also have had very different approaches to free
speech issues. Time-Warner has made itself a champion of the First
Amendment by backing aggressive journalistic institutions,
including CNN, Time magazine and Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, AOL is known for its willingness to censor speech
among subscribers. Use the wrong words on line, and AOL will banish
you.
</P>
<P>
   With AOL chairman Steve Case now set to become chairman of the
combined enterprise, free-speech advocates are wondering whether
what they call AOL's ``Big Brother'' culture will spread throughout
the media empire and have a chilling effect on freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be attentive to the new ways that the free flow of
information can be stifled,'' said Andrew Shapiro, author of ``The
Control Revolution'' and an expert on free speech on the Internet.
``We no longer worry so much about the rogue constable using a
wooden club on the political dissident. Now censorship is more
likely to come from a corporation that wants to shape discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL argues that it was never intended to serve as a ``public
square'' for free speech. Rather, it was designed to be a ``gated
community'' where people choose to abide by certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules prohibit obscene or threatening language. AOL
monitors chat room conversations and, if it receives a complaint
from a member, may review instant messages and e-mails to determine
whether the content was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rich D'Amato said parents like the company's ability
to block unwanted efforts to ``harass, threaten or embarrass''
members. ``It's part of the appeal of AOL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all members are happy with the monitoring. For example,
last fall, AOL incurred the wrath of civil liberties advocates and
gay rights groups when it deleted the personal profile of a gay man
who described himself as a ``submissive bottom.'' AOL said that
description was ``objectionable content.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Romanello, executive director of the Washington-based
NationalGayLobby.Org, pointed out that other AOL members have
personal profiles listing hobbies such as ``killing fags.'' By
allowing such anti-gay comments, AOL makes itself a moral arbiter,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want them to be even-handed,'' he said. ``You can't be
up in arms about sex, but then say it's OK to want to kill
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this month, the gay profile controversy was typical of the
debate over AOL monitoring, with people arguing about how AOL
should draw lines, not whether the company had the right to do so.
But that's because AOL was just one of many online services. If a
member got banished from AOL, he could switch to a different
service provider to get access to the vast Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That freedom to walk away from AOL may be eroded by the proposed
merger. By acquiring Time Warner, AOL will gain control of that
company's cable systems. Those systems generally are operated as
local monopolies, and they can be used to provide much faster
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If a person could get high-speed access to the Internet only
through Time Warner wires and an AOL subscription, should such a
powerful monopoly still have the right to monitor discussions?
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T doesn't tell you what kind of conversations you are
allowed to have through its wires,'' said Jim Naureckas, editor of
the magazine Extra!, produced by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
(FAIR), a non-profit media watchdog group in New York. In coming
years, the courts or Congress may have to act to ensure that
free-speech principles are respected by AOL and other companies
offering high-speed access to the Internet through cable
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   If not, ``the people who own the wires will set the rules'' for
speech, he said. ``And we'll have to live by their rules, not by
the First Amendment.''

&HT;     PICTURE THIS: FRAMED PHOTOS ENHANCE HOME DECORATING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Accessorizing a room personalizes it, and allows it to reflect
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Frame your interests with photographs that chronicle your life
and are cherished keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Framed photographs around the room have replaced the baby
grand piano of the 1920s,'' mused interior designer George Orton
III of Lee, Mass. ``Photos used to be placed on a Spanish shawl on
the baby grand. But now the piano has vanished from most living
rooms, and photos are placed on tables and consoles. It's fun to
look at pictures, especially if they are arranged well as a
decorative statement, rather than one photo on each table.''
</P>
<P>
   A myriad of frames fit any decor, color scheme or theme, from
rustic to Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   Good-looking frames are easy to find by scouting out home
centers, art or hobby stores, card shops, photo or gift stores,
antiques shops, flea markets and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on size and materials, the cost can range from
approximately $8 to $20 for novelty and wood frames of small to
medium size. Silver and glass frames may cost more, up to $100. If
you are on a budget or plan to buy a lot of frames, watch for
sales, often two-for-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might start your tablescape with an interesting lamp,''
Orton said. ``And gauge the size of your picture frames from there.
I personally like all the same frame in different sizes and shapes,
from ovals and horizontals to verticals. If the frames are all the
same size, it becomes boring and you don't see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos should be arranged in a pleasing manner, added Orton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to arrange people who like each other together; you'll
find that helps,'' Orton said. ``To create interest, try placing
some of the photos on a short stack of two or three leather-bound
books, so that you are not looking at just a sea of faces. You
should also use some other object, so everything isn't standing up,
such as a small silver tray with some hard candy on it or a low
bowl of floating flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   You need other items, like a box collection, to balance out this
still life, said interior designer Michel Patterson, owner of
Hudson River Fine Interiors in Loudonville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might add a small piece of sculpture,'' Patterson said.
``Framed photos can be jewel-like rather than the whole show. You
want to discover them as you look across the table or through the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton also suggested combining framed photos with interesting
collections. Paperweights work well, as do seashells paired with
photos taken at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Metal frames, particularly brass, are very popular, but make
sure the metal won't scratch the surface it is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A table skirted to the floor makes a perfect setting for a
photo grouping,'' Orton said. ``It creates the same background and
ambience as the shawl on the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also are producing frames for a younger market in
resins, which come in solid colors, wood look-alikes or patterns
such as faux leopard. The bright colored frames work well in
contemporary interiors and as colorful accents.
</P>
<P>
   Frames also come molded, stained, painted or covered in fabric
or paper.
</P>
<P>
   For traditional interiors, dens and family rooms, look to real
hardwood frames made of mahogany, maple, silver or gold leaf.
Although beautiful in grain and color, oak tends to be less formal.
A knotty pine or twig frame is perfect for the Adirondack look,
where a crackled paint finish is the perfect patina for shabby chic
or a country look.
</P>
<P>
   Brushed steel provides a high-tech look.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no set rule,'' Patterson said. ``If something
doesn't feel or light right, rearrange it until it does. Try a
grouping of all black and white images or sepia, rather than just
all color photographs. Hand-colored photos are very popular today
for a vintage look. You can also mix these up with newer ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for interesting frames, but they shouldn't dominate the
picture,'' Orton said. ``Sometimes the frame is so elaborate, you
don't notice the picture, but then you might want it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to change your photos often, look to frames with
easy access, such as those with trapdoor backs.
</P>
<P>
   Orton said you might want to display a group of large photos on
a wall in the hallway or powder room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family photos look great hung this way,'' Orton said. ``Just
make sure they are matted, which makes them look a little more
important, and use the same frame for each.''
</P>
<P>
   For the latest in gadgetry, try a Sony CyberFrame Viewer
(approximately $899) to display your digital images. You can delete
images, re-arrange their order or include sound.

   Q: Where can I write to Bob Hope? _ C.H., Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the 96-year-old comedian and actor in care of Bob
Hope Enterprises, 3808 Riverside Drive, Suite 100, Burbank, CA
91505.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Enterprises sells videos, golf equipment and Hope
memorabilia at the Web site www.bobhope.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is also being used to debunk rumors about health
problems. ``Contrary to what you may have read in a tabloid or are
hearing on the Fox News in Cleveland _ I'm having a bite of
lunch,'' Hope writes. ``According to the tabloid _ I collapsed. No
one here, including me, knows when that was or where it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently rented the documentary ``Incident at Oglala.'' How
can I get in touch with people trying to get Leonard Peltier
released from prison? _ T.B., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, Box 583,
Lawrence, KS 66044; call (785) 842-5774; or visit the Web site
www.freepeltier.org.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, 1975, FBI agents Ronald Williams and Jack Coler died
in a shootout with members of the American Indian Movement near
Oglala, S.D. In 1977, Peltier was convicted of murdering the agents
and sentenced to two consecutive life terms.
</P>
<P>
   Peltier, who says he is innocent, has been the subject of
international efforts to persuade President Clinton to grant him
clemency. More than 25 million signatures have been collected
calling for his release, according to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Peltier wrote a memoir, ``Prison Writings: My Life Is
My Sun Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the rules are for bringing liquor across the Mexican
border? _ S.C., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: In Texas, the maximum a state resident can bring back from
Mexico is three gallons of wine, 24 12-ounce containers of beer and
one quart of distilled spirits, according to the Texas Alcoholic
Beverage Commission.
</P>
<P>
   These beverages are subject to state taxes. For 24 containers of
beer, the tax is 98 cents. The tax is $1.10 for a quart of
distilled spirits.
</P>
<P>
   You also must pay duty taxes on goods brought back into the
United States. U.S. Customs regulations allow up to one liter of
alcoholic beverages to be included in the normal $400 exemption
from taxes if you are at least 21 and the beverages are not being
imported for commercial sale.

 &HT;    BATTLE LOOMS IN CONGRESS OVER COLLEGE SPORTS BETTING
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (s) sports categories for
release Monday, Jan. 24.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is gearing up for a battle over whether to
outlaw gambling on college sports, with the politically powerful
gaming industry opposing legislation that colleges say would
protect their students.
</P>
<P>
   National Collegiate Athletic Association members were rocked by
eight major point-shaving scandals during the 1990s, as many as in
the previous 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of the NCAA, the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission recommended to Congress last year that wagering on
collegiate and amateur athletic events be banned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., plan to introduce a bill that would ban gambling on high
school and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect the integrity of high school and college
athletics and reduce the unseemly influences that gambling has on
our student athletes,'' Brownback said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last moved to restrict sports wagering in 1991, banning
it in all states except Oregon, Nevada and Delaware. Oregon allows
wagering on football through a lottery, and Delaware, despite a
1976 public vote approving it, has not adopted sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the bulk of sports betting in Nevada, where $2.3
million is wagered legally each year on sporting events, one-third
of it on college athletics. The NCAA men's basketball tournament
each March and football bowl games account for between $50 to $60
million each.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming
Association, said the Brownback-Leahy bill would cost Nevada's
economy thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``would be a crippling blow to our industry,'' agreed
Pete Korner, operations manager of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, an
independently-owned odds-making firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf said that when Congress holds hearings on the bill,
he will argue that instead of banning college sports wagering,
colleges should focus on rooting out illegal bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every college campus in America, there is an illegal
student bookie taking bets on college games,'' Fahrenkopf said in
an interview. ``So what the NCAA and the senators are talking about
is what's going on at (the institutions), not Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing'' to work with the NCAA if given the chance,
Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that once during the 1994 basketball season,
bookmakers in Nevada discovered that the betting pattern on Arizona
State University changed tremendously, and the bookies alerted the
FBI. That led to the arrest of two players who pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Dixon, NCAA director of federal relations, acknowledged
that the gaming industry was responsible for blowing the whistle on
the players. But if gambling on games had been illegal, she said,
the players might not have been involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you did alert the FBI, but it was only after the damage
had been done,'' Dixon said. ``By helping put those kids in jail,
you only help end their careers and whatever opportunities they may
have had. (The gaming industry's) whole reason for being is to make
money, not to protect the students. We are trying to protect our
students.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf responded that if the Association is trying to
protect students, ``why hasn't it required the schools to put in
place programs to educate the students?''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the NCAA acknowledges that it is responsible for
imposing stiffer penalties and educating students. She said the
organization is working with the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators to educate students about the dangers of
gambling. In addition, the NCAA requires TV networks to air
anti-gambling public service messages during games.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also funded a study on gambling behavior that found
that wagering on college sports is a gateway for many gambling
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In different study released last year by the University of
Michigan, a survey of 750 male and female student athletes found
that 72 percent had gambled in some form since entering college. Of
that, 80 percent were males.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the student athletes said they wagered $57.25 on a
single sporting event through a bookmaker. Those same students
gambled $225 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of student athletes said they had wagered at
a casino, while 35 percent bet on sports. Five percent said they
provided inside information for gambling purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Student athletes wager so much money because their judgment is
not always as sound as adults', Dixon said. ``They are big in size,
but they are kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said that because gambling is legal in Nevada, most
newspapers publish betting lines for college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school can be listed for people to bet on them, and we
feel that's wrong,'' Dixon said. ``All the students have to do is
open the paper and find out the betting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the gambling bill is introduced, Fahrenkopf said his
office has contacted several senators about it.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that one was Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is
in charge of raising campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone on my staff may have spoken with someone on his
staff,'' Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the public interest group Public Citizen, in recent
election cycles the casino gambling industry has contributed a
total of $4.23 million to three national Republican Party election
committees, while the corresponding Democratic Party committees
received $2.29 million.

 &HT;    BATTLE LOOMS IN CONGRESS OVER COLLEGE SPORTS BETTING
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (s) sports categories for
release Monday, Jan. 24.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is gearing up for a battle over whether to
outlaw gambling on college sports, with the politically powerful
gaming industry opposing legislation that colleges say would
protect their students.
</P>
<P>
   National Collegiate Athletic Association members were rocked by
eight major point-shaving scandals during the 1990s, as many as in
the previous 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of the NCAA, the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission recommended to Congress last year that wagering on
collegiate and amateur athletic events be banned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., plan to introduce a bill that would ban gambling on high
school and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect the integrity of high school and college
athletics and reduce the unseemly influences that gambling has on
our student athletes,'' Brownback said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last moved to restrict sports wagering in 1991, banning
it in all states except Oregon, Nevada and Delaware. Oregon allows
wagering on football through a lottery, and Delaware, despite a
1976 public vote approving it, has not adopted sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the bulk of sports betting in Nevada, where $2.3
million is wagered legally each year on sporting events, one-third
of it on college athletics. The NCAA men's basketball tournament
each March and football bowl games account for between $50 to $60
million each.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming
Association, said the Brownback-Leahy bill would cost Nevada's
economy thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``would be a crippling blow to our industry,'' agreed
Pete Korner, operations manager of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, an
independently-owned odds-making firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf said that when Congress holds hearings on the bill,
he will argue that instead of banning college sports wagering,
colleges should focus on rooting out illegal bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every college campus in America, there is an illegal
student bookie taking bets on college games,'' Fahrenkopf said in
an interview. ``So what the NCAA and the senators are talking about
is what's going on at (the institutions), not Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing'' to work with the NCAA if given the chance,
Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that once during the 1994 basketball season,
bookmakers in Nevada discovered that the betting pattern on Arizona
State University changed tremendously, and the bookies alerted the
FBI. That led to the arrest of two players who pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Dixon, NCAA director of federal relations, acknowledged
that the gaming industry was responsible for blowing the whistle on
the players. But if gambling on games had been illegal, she said,
the players might not have been involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you did alert the FBI, but it was only after the damage
had been done,'' Dixon said. ``By helping put those kids in jail,
you only help end their careers and whatever opportunities they may
have had. (The gaming industry's) whole reason for being is to make
money, not to protect the students. We are trying to protect our
students.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf responded that if the Association is trying to
protect students, ``why hasn't it required the schools to put in
place programs to educate the students?''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the NCAA acknowledges that it is responsible for
imposing stiffer penalties and educating students. She said the
organization is working with the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators to educate students about the dangers of
gambling. In addition, the NCAA requires TV networks to air
anti-gambling public service messages during games.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also funded a study on gambling behavior that found
that wagering on college sports is a gateway for many gambling
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In different study released last year by the University of
Michigan, a survey of 750 male and female student athletes found
that 72 percent had gambled in some form since entering college. Of
that, 80 percent were males.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the student athletes said they wagered $57.25 on a
single sporting event through a bookmaker. Those same students
gambled $225 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of student athletes said they had wagered at
a casino, while 35 percent bet on sports. Five percent said they
provided inside information for gambling purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Student athletes wager so much money because their judgment is
not always as sound as adults', Dixon said. ``They are big in size,
but they are kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said that because gambling is legal in Nevada, most
newspapers publish betting lines for college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school can be listed for people to bet on them, and we
feel that's wrong,'' Dixon said. ``All the students have to do is
open the paper and find out the betting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the gambling bill is introduced, Fahrenkopf said his
office has contacted several senators about it.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that one was Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is
in charge of raising campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone on my staff may have spoken with someone on his
staff,'' Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the public interest group Public Citizen, in recent
election cycles the casino gambling industry has contributed a
total of $4.23 million to three national Republican Party election
committees, while the corresponding Democratic Party committees
received $2.29 million.

 &HT;    Best models for female ordination are flawed women, author says
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saints are terrible role models,'' the Rev. Joseph Goetz
writes engagingly in his little book, Mirrors of God ($6.95,
Forward Movement Press). Saints are bigger than life; how can we
ever measure up?
</P>
<P>
   We can't, of course. That's why Goetz offers six, very flawed
female models. Two of them had children out of wedlock; one of them
may have starved herself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of them embody what Goetz calls ``classic Christian
themes.'' Mother Teresa's appearance in Goetz's devotional won't
surprise anyone, but the chapter on Simone Weil _ a Jew _ might.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz, 66, retired pastor of St. Paul's Church in Yellow
Springs, put this book together after a series of talks with the
Episcopal Sisters of the Transfiguration in Glendale, Ohio. It was
first published in 1985, but a new revised edition includes
sketches of each woman by the author _ a prolific artist _ and a
note: ``... the underlying motive for this book remains the same;
sound theology not only allows for, but urges, the inclusion of
women in the ordained ministry.'' That would include his own faith
_ Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The women in his book, he says, are the best argument for female
ordination, by the way they have lived their lives. They are:
Dorothy Day, pacifist, servant of the poor in this country and
co-founder of The Catholic Worker; Anne Morrow Lindbergh, writer
and wife of the famous aviator; Weil, a writer; Dorothy L. Sayers,
a writer best known for her character, Lord Peter Wimsey, but who
also wrote about theology; Evelyn Underhill, writer and mystical
seeker, and Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman, Goetz says, represents an aspect of Christianity
that is rooted in the New Testament: Day embodies conversion, ``the
daily turning toward the Lord;'' Lindbergh is about ``building
community;'' Weil (allowed) ``one's life to be an announcement of
God's love;'' Sayers represents ``reasoning with all of one's
faculties about the faith;'' Underhill is an illustration of
``worshiping the Lord in the gathered Body of Christ,'' and Mother
Teresa is about ``reaching out to others in loving service.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetz thinks that Day and Mother Teresa both have a good chance
of being canonized, even though Day, who had a child while
unmarried, also is said to have had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He met both women briefly in Cincinnati on different occasions,
many years ago. Day, he recalls, was ``quite remarkable ... putting
her faith into action.'' Mother Teresa impressed him as being ``a
simple peasant woman, really,'' who spoke English quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Goetz ruminates on a brown scrap of paper
said to have been pinned to the pulpit of a 15th-century church in
Tuscany that was known for it priceless paintings. The paper simply
read, ``God loves you now!''
</P>
<P>
   A simple message, really, at the heart of it all. That's the
message that he thinks these six women understood. ``Some people
think they can save themselves by being nice. But it is God who
saves us.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what he took away for himself in the process of
writing the book. It's a message he preaches during his occasional
turns at St. Charles Borremeo Church in Kettering. ``And when I
preach, the first person I'm preaching to is myself.''

U.S. AID PREDICTED TO TURN COLOMBIAN DRUG TIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Despite a surge in Colombia's cocaine
production, a top Pentagon official Thursday predicted that a
proposed $1.6 billion U.S. aid package would help turn the tide in
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug production has increased dramatically and will continue
to increase if we do not take immediate steps, and that's what this
plan is about,'' said Louis Caldera, the secretary of the U.S. Army
who is on the final leg of a trip to Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence that this program will show
dramatic results in 18 months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money in the two-year emergency aid plan announced
by the Clinton administration last week would help Colombia's army
and police fight Marxist guerrillas, who are heavily involved in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   It would also expand a controversial policy of forcibly
eradicating vast plantations of coca leaves, the raw material for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package marks a sharp increase in Washington's
commitment to Colombia, which received about $300 million in U.S.
assistance last year. Colombia is the third leading recipient of
U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts say that the flow of Colombian drugs to the
United States is larger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Colombia
is expected to produce 330 to 440 tons of cocaine this year, up
from an estimated 220 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia supplies about 80 percent of the cocaine and the
majority of the heroin consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Soon-to-be released CIA estimates of Colombian land being used
to grow coca will indicate an increase of up to 50 percent in the
past year, according to Thomas Umberg, deputy director of White
House Drug Control Policy, who is traveling with Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   But Umberg said that more U.S. aid could reverse this trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's proposal, which requires
congressional approval but appears to have bipartisan support,
includes 38 helicopters for the underequipped Colombian army and
resources and training for three elite counterdrug battalions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to pave the way for a Colombian military
push into southern Putumayo and Caqueta states.
</P>
<P>
   Because this region is largely controlled by guerrillas who
attack police crop-dusting planes, pilots have been unable to spray
coca plantations in the two states, and coca production has
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy involves sending in counterdrug battalions to
secure drug-producing areas for fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S.-trained counterdrug battalion is already operating in
southern Colombia, and two more battalions will be activated later
this year, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   About 170 U.S. troops are training the counterdrug battalions.
But Caldera said that American soldiers will not take part in field
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to go down and control the area,'' Umberg
said. ``This is an (aid) package designed to really address the
problems in a comprehensive way in a relatively short period of
time.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; U.S. efforts to wipe out coca and promote legal crops have had
success in Bolivia and Peru, where drug production has dropped
dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Drug cartels responded by shifting much of their coca production
to Colombia, where the government is unable to control much of the
countryside due to a 36-year-old guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that even if coca plantations in Putumayo and
Caqueta are destroyed, the crop is so lucrative that peasants may
simply push deeper into the jungle to plant more.
</P>
<P>
   Umberg pointed out, however, that the U.S. aid proposal includes
millions of dollars for programs to encourage coca farmers to grow
legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Washington has refused to support alternative
development in Colombia due to fears that the money would wind up
in rebel hands.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sidiki Conde climbs five flights to his East Village
apartment. He travels to schools and colleges throughout the United
States, most recently the California Institute of the Arts, to
teach West African traditional music and dance. He will perform the
arts he teaches Saturday night in a studio theater at the Djoniba
School on East 18th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all this unusual is that Conde is paralyzed from the
waist down. He dances _ and climbs those stairs _ on his hands, his
legs tucked around his body as he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Conde's journey from Kankan, the village in Guinea where he grew
up, to the stage and on to the United States has been as full of
challenges and magical improbabilities as a fairy tale. Conde's
life was relatively uneventful until an illness struck him at 14,
to this day undiagnosed, and left him almost totally paralyzed. ``I
fell, and never got up again,'' Conde, now 38, said in a recent
interview. For two months he sat at home, doing nothing. Then he
had a dream.
</P>
<P>
   In the dream, a voice told him to sing. ``But I don't have
hands, I don't have legs,'' Conde responded. The voice repeated its
command. What kind of song should he sing? ``Sing `Mother don't
cry, I'm not handicapped any more,''' the voice answered.
</P>
<P>
   His mother cried even harder. ``Look at you!'' he recalled her
saying. ``Don't tell me you don't have a handicap. I still have to
take care of you all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conde did begin to sing, regaining more use of his upper
body. He persuaded a school friend, Sidi, to carry him to a club
where, somehow, he joined the dancers when he could no longer bear
to watch. He had studied the ways ducks moved. So imitated them by
using his hands, fingers spread, like webbed feet.
</P>
<P>
   There was applause and gifts of money with which the two boys
bought a cassette player. Street performances followed, dancing and
singing to taped music. Friends joined them. But Conde's father
soon put a stop to it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the military,'' Conde said. ``He didn't like
music.''
</P>
<P>
   After three unhappy years studying the Koran at a Muslim school
in which his father enrolled him, Conde ran away to live with Sidi.
The two formed an orchestra called 22 Bandes de Kan Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Conde was invited to join a bigger and more important troupe.
``But I didn't know music,'' he recalled. What he was then
performing was his own impromptu mix of the traditional music and
jazz he had absorbed. ``So I took all my friends with me to the big
city, to Conakry,'' he said. ``We were popular there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Conde was soon invited to organize a group of handicapped
musicians and dancers, which he named Message d'Espoir. In 1987, he
became a member of Les Merveilles de Guinea, founded the year
before by Kemoko Sano, who encouraged his young disciple to train
seriously in the kind of traditional West African music and dance
the group performed. Conde moved to New York in 1998 and married
Deborah Ross, a wildlife watercolorist. He is a faculty member of
the Djoniba School, teaching traditional Malinka dance and the
playing of the djembe, doun doun and sanbang drums.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's concert will feature Conde, a performer of
immense warmth, skill and agility, his troupe Tokounou, members of
Les Merveilles who have settled in the Bronx and guests like
Yamoussa and Mohamed Camara on the djembe, Keba Bobo Cissako on the
kora and Abou Sylla on the balaphone. West African musicians and
dancers from throughout the Northeast are expected to turn up for
what promises to be something of a family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Conde became paralyzed, he knew that he ``did not
want to sit down.'' He decided he should try to become a fire-eater
like his grandfather. He burned his throat and burned down his
grandfather's house. Music came to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel good,'' he said. ``I want people to use me. I
want to do something. I'm fine for working.''

&HT;     PICTURE THIS: FRAMED PHOTOS ENHANCE HOME DECORATING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Accessorizing a room personalizes it, and allows it to reflect
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Frame your interests with photographs that chronicle your life
and are cherished keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Framed photographs around the room have replaced the baby
grand piano of the 1920s,'' mused interior designer George Orton
III of Lee, Mass. ``Photos used to be placed on a Spanish shawl on
the baby grand. But now the piano has vanished from most living
rooms, and photos are placed on tables and consoles. It's fun to
look at pictures, especially if they are arranged well as a
decorative statement, rather than one photo on each table.''
</P>
<P>
   A myriad of frames fit any decor, color scheme or theme, from
rustic to Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   Good-looking frames are easy to find by scouting out home
centers, art or hobby stores, card shops, photo or gift stores,
antiques shops, flea markets and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on size and materials, the cost can range from
approximately $8 to $20 for novelty and wood frames of small to
medium size. Silver and glass frames may cost more, up to $100. If
you are on a budget or plan to buy a lot of frames, watch for
sales, often two-for-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might start your tablescape with an interesting lamp,''
Orton said. ``And gauge the size of your picture frames from there.
I personally like all the same frame in different sizes and shapes,
from ovals and horizontals to verticals. If the frames are all the
same size, it becomes boring and you don't see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos should be arranged in a pleasing manner, added Orton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to arrange people who like each other together; you'll
find that helps,'' Orton said. ``To create interest, try placing
some of the photos on a short stack of two or three leather-bound
books, so that you are not looking at just a sea of faces. You
should also use some other object, so everything isn't standing up,
such as a small silver tray with some hard candy on it or a low
bowl of floating flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   You need other items, like a box collection, to balance out this
still life, said interior designer Michel Patterson, owner of
Hudson River Fine Interiors in Loudonville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might add a small piece of sculpture,'' Patterson said.
``Framed photos can be jewel-like rather than the whole show. You
want to discover them as you look across the table or through the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton also suggested combining framed photos with interesting
collections. Paperweights work well, as do seashells paired with
photos taken at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Metal frames, particularly brass, are very popular, but make
sure the metal won't scratch the surface it is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A table skirted to the floor makes a perfect setting for a

ambience as the shawl on the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also are producing frames for a younger market in
resins, which come in solid colors, wood look-alikes or patterns

contemporary interiors and as colorful accents.
</P>
<P>
   Frames also come molded, stained, painted or covered in fabric
or paper.
</P>
<P>
   For traditional interiors, dens and family rooms, look to real
hardwood frames made of mahogany, maple, silver or gold leaf.
Although beautiful in grain and color, oak tends to be less formal.
A knotty pine or twig frame is perfect for the Adirondack look,

or a country look.

   ``There's really no set rule,'' Patterson said. ``If something
doesn't feel or light right, rearrange it until it does. Try a
grouping of all black and white images or sepia, rather than just
all color photographs. Hand-colored photos are very popular today
for a vintage look. You can also mix these up with newer ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for interesting frames, but they shouldn't dominate the
picture,'' Orton said. ``Sometimes the frame is so elaborate, you
don't notice the picture, but then you might want it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to change your photos often, look to frames with
easy access, such as those with trapdoor backs.
</P>
<P>
   Orton said you might want to display a group of large photos on
a wall in the hallway or powder room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family photos look great hung this way,'' Orton said. ``Just
make sure they are matted, which makes them look a little more
important, and use the same frame for each.''

<P>
   Accessorizing a room personalizes it, and allows it to reflect
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Frame your interests with photographs that chronicle your life
and are cherished keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Framed photographs around the room have replaced the baby
grand piano of the 1920s,'' mused interior designer George Orton
III of Lee, Mass. ``Photos used to be placed on a Spanish shawl on
the baby grand. But now the piano has vanished from most living
rooms, and photos are placed on tables and consoles. It's fun to
look at pictures, especially if they are arranged well as a
decorative statement, rather than one photo on each table.''
</P>
<P>
   A myriad of frames fit any decor, color scheme or theme, from
rustic to Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   Good-looking frames are easy to find by scouting out home
centers, art or hobby stores, card shops, photo or gift stores,
antiques shops, flea markets and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on size and materials, the cost can range from
approximately $8 to $20 for novelty and wood frames of small to
medium size. Silver and glass frames may cost more, up to $100. If
you are on a budget or plan to buy a lot of frames, watch for
sales, often two-for-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might start your tablescape with an interesting lamp,''
Orton said. ``And gauge the size of your picture frames from there.
I personally like all the same frame in different sizes and shapes,
from ovals and horizontals to verticals. If the frames are all the
same size, it becomes boring and you don't see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos should be arranged in a pleasing manner, added Orton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to arrange people who like each other together; you'll
find that helps,'' Orton said. ``To create interest, try placing
some of the photos on a short stack of two or three leather-bound
books, so that you are not looking at just a sea of faces. You
should also use some other object, so everything isn't standing up,
such as a small silver tray with some hard candy on it or a low
bowl of floating flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   You need other items, like a box collection, to balance out this
still life, said interior designer Michel Patterson, owner of
Hudson River Fine Interiors in Loudonville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might add a small piece of sculpture,'' Patterson said.
``Framed photos can be jewel-like rather than the whole show. You
want to discover them as you look across the table or through the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton also suggested combining framed photos with interesting
collections. Paperweights work well, as do seashells paired with
photos taken at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Metal frames, particularly brass, are very popular, but make
sure the metal won't scratch the surface it is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A table skirted to the floor makes a perfect setting for a
photo grouping,'' Orton said. ``It creates the same background and
ambience as the shawl on the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also are producing frames for a younger market in
resins, which come in solid colors, wood look-alikes or patterns
such as faux leopard. The bright colored frames work well in
contemporary interiors and as colorful accents.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dan Gluck and Alison Maddex _ the stylish young
entrepreneurs who hope to build the Museum of Sex on Fifth Avenue _
always worry about revealing to reporters the story of how they
met.
</P>
<P>
   Their reluctance says less about the business partners than it
does about their experiences trying to get their decidedly
untraditional museum off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a little bit _ yeah, let's just forget it,'' Ms.
Maddex said. ``It's weird. Even though it's not really weird. It
could be weird to a lot of people.'' She pauses. ``Yeah, I think
we'd better not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluck: ``We're being too vague.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex: ``It's not really a big deal. But people reading
about it _ you never know what goes on in people's minds, the way
they twist things.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``It's really no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Well, tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Long pause.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``We had a shared lover. That's it.'' He adds quickly, ``You
can see how that might confuse a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not terribly confusing. The short version is that
while Ms. Maddex, 33, and Gluck, 31, were at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts together, she dated a very
attractive woman whom Gluck later also dated. As he describes it,
``We both kind of had our obsessions with this person.'' No
jealousy, really. No anger. Pretty tame fare even for a campus soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Maddex _ an artist, curator and art teacher who has been
the romantic companion of the writer Camille Paglia for the last
seven years and has been dating women much longer than that _ gets
nervous nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because of the attitudes that she and Gluck, a
thin, hyper-energetic former software company owner, have
encountered over the last three years while trying to find support
for what they see as a great idea, long overdue: a serious museum
about one of our most basic and entertaining urges and its impact
on art, popular culture and even science throughout human history.
</P>
<P>
   All of the big cultural foundations shied away from the idea,
they said. A newspaper ran a story about the proposed museum, using
``XXX'' in the headline and making Gluck's father, a diamond dealer
who works on 47th Street, very, very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The partners could not even get permission from the New York
State Board of Regents, the group that oversees nonprofit cultural
institutions, to use the name Museum of Sex. The board cited its
guidelines, which discourage the use of the word ``museum'' in any
way that makes a mockery of the term.
</P>
<P>
   And so Gluck and Ms. Maddex had to register the museum as a
for-profit corporation in Delaware, much like a Fortune 500
company.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the two still find themselves trying to convince
people that they have no intention of becoming, as Gluck puts it,
the ``Ripley's Believe It or Not of sex.'' But they don't have to
do the convincing as often as before, and in their more optimistic
moments they have begun to allow themselves to believe things are
turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paglia has lent her name to the project. The museum has
begun to work with the famous Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex,
Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University. And this week, it
was included among the 29 institutions that received art from the
collection of Peter Norton, the California software entrepreneur,
and his wife, Eileen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the two were camped out in the shabby
building that Gluck and several partners bought and plan to tear
down to make room for the museum, at Fifth Avenue and 27th Street.
Their makeshift offices sit in a former shoe store, where
faux-bamboo shelves still line one wall. Instead of shoes, though,
the shelves are now filled with magazines, some pornographic and
many not.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck and Ms. Maddex _ who had fallen out of touch after college
and were then reacquainted by their common ex-girlfriend (``This
project is, in a weird way, predestined,'' he says) _ are the kind
of friends and partners who sometimes finish each other's
sentences. More often they talk at the same time and repeat the
ends of each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big ideas,'' Gluck says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex echoes: ``Big ideas, right.''
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed in muted browns and blacks with lots of
pinstripes, and she was wearing a leopard-print shirt, short
pleated black skirt and tall black leather boots. But like most
people who are in the business of sex, from whatever angle, the two
do not seem to exude a tremendous amount of sexiness themselves.
They did not even say very many things that were unprintable in
this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And they added that most of the people who knew them as children
probably would not have guessed that they would go on to found a
cultural institution devoted to sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex grew up mostly in Washington, where her father was a
lawyer for the Justice Department and her mother was a publisher.
Briefly in high school, she says, she was a cheerleader. Gluck grew
up in Flushing, Queens, on Long Island and in Manhattan. His
father, who immigrated from Belgium, and his mother, who immigrated
from Iraq, are kind of ``Old World conservatives,'' he said, who
have slowly come to accept his new calling.
</P>
<P>
   Both partners are in long-term relationships. Gluck got married
in 1998, and sounding a lot like he is trying not to sound too
boring, he says he even wants to have children. ``Oh yes. We want
to breed. We're pretty traditional that way, I guess. I get that
question from a lot of people these days.''

 &HT;    TEN-MONTH MEXICAN STUDENT STRIKE ERODES FURTHER AFTER REFERENDUM
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For nearly 10 months one of the world's largest
public universities has been paralyzed by a student strike no
Mexican politician has been savvy enough to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a radical core, the strikers have grown increasingly
isolated from a public that once sympathized with their basic
demands. Even liberal newspapers here have turned their backs,
mocking the strikers as rebels without a cause and foolish brats
decked out in Che Guevara shirts, phony dreadlocks and multiple
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Mexico's National Autonomous University,
or UNAM, gave in months ago to the students' primary demand to keep
the university's fees only a few cents a year rather than hiking it
up to $70 a semester. But the strikers still have grievances _ some
of which appear murky to many Mexicans _ and remain barricaded on
campuses that are normally bustling with more than 270,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the strikers suffered a public-relations
setback many Mexicans hope could help bring the conflict to a
climax and finally yield a solution. The UNAM's newly appointed
rector, former Mexican Health Minister Ramon de la Fuente,
organized a referendum to allow students and employees to vote on
whether they believe his latest proposal should be accepted and the
strike called off.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 150,000 votes were cast, according to initial reports
Friday. But more than 86 percent of participants said they
supported the proposal, which would retain the university's
traditionally free tuition as well as establish a congress in which
students could help determine university policies.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was held Thursday, the day after the striking
students held their own two-day balloting in a bid to gauge public
support for their cause. The students haven't announced the results
of their vote and pressure is on them now to respond to what is
perceived as a coup for the rector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize this has legitimacy, even though not very many
people voted,'' admitted strike supporter Karina Mucino, 32, an
education major who was standing at a roadblock on the edge of
campus Friday making sure that only a relative handful of
maintenance and research employees entered the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Mucino said the rector's referendum isn't going to
automatically convince strikers to open the university.
</P>
<P>
   She said it would be wise at this point for the strike council
to sit down and negotiate over de la Fuente's proposal and haggle
over the bones of contention. The strikers, for example, are
sticking to their demand that high school students at
UNAM-affiliated schools be allowed automatic passage to the
university. The rector rejects that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Law student Gerardo Becerril, also 23, said he voted in both
referendums for the strike to end. ``I'm not against the strike
council,'' he said, explaining that he supported the initial
demands to keep free tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in Mexico the only way to get the authorities'
attention is to do something dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said the striking students have lost their focus,
allowed the movement to be hijacked by radicals known as ``ultras''
and permitted vandals to deface the campus.
</P>
<P>
   His hope is that the rector's pledge to establish a university
congress that includes students _ another strike demand _ will help
revamp the university and make it more financially sound.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAM was born with Mexico's 1910 Revolution, which was
supposed to rid the country of extreme inequality. For many of
Mexico's poor and working class, it is the only option to obtain a
college degree.
</P>
<P>
   The government has declined to force an end to the strike,
mindful that Mexicans still remember when troops killed protesting
students in 1968 when soldiers opened fire on them in a public
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Some strikers admit that there are students who could have
clearly afforded a $70 semester fee. But they say they fear a
gradual slide into a free-market educational system in Mexico. Some
of their concern appears to stem from the government's steps in
recent years to privatize state-run industries, an experiment that
has yielded a mixed bag of successful ventures and financial
disasters. Mexico's privatized banks, for example, collapsed under
a burden of bad loans and corrupt practices, leaving the government
to use public money to help sustain those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has money to rescue crooked bankers,'' Mucino
said, ``but it says it doesn't have money for education.''

LATEST POLL: PETS AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're here. We love pets. Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   If we pet people marched on Washington, that would be our
rallying cry. But, of course, we don't need to demonstrate (or
rhyme) because we are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes our behavior ``the norm.'' Ha!
</P>
<P>
   The concept may be a scary one when you read the results of the
latest national survey of pet owners conducted by the American
Animal Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Our love is as shameless as it is deep and, unlike those sex
surveys that you never quite believe, you will recognize yourself
in these results if you're a pet owner. In fact, the weirder the
responses, the more we identify with them. People may lie about
bedroom antics, but they tell the truth about cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the answers, there are some that you would expect. Like
the way we define our relationship with animals: 84 percent of the
1,200 respondents from the United States and Canada refer to
themselves as their pet's ``Mom'' or ``Dad.'' Natch. (What about
that other 16 percent, though? Do they call themselves their pet's
``good friend''? Animal Beat wants to know.)
</P>
<P>
   There are items that clarify how close we are to them: A
whopping 94 percent of us keep a pet's photo on display. The spot
that the most pets sleep on is our beds (46 percent). Sixty-three
percent of us celebrate our pet's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not surprising to see the way we project ourselves onto
them: Eighteen percent of us think our pet is a genius; 57 percent
feel their pet is smart.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some deliciously revealing reactions in the
survey, whose respondents take their pets to association
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two percent of married respondents ``greet their pet
first when they return home.'' Ring a bell? It actually makes
sense. How often does your significant other bound to the door
(wearing only a collar, Cosmo girls!) at the sound of your
footsteps, communicating ``You! Fabulous you! You're home! And I
love love love YOU''? Well, why can't they both act that way?
Imagine your spouse and your pet brawling all the way down the
hallway, knocking each other out of the way to get to you first.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of us bring our pets to the vet more often than we
see our own physicians. And about half of us have taken time off
work to tend to a sick pet.
</P>
<P>
   We know who loves us, baby. But how about understanding? We
believe that pets ``understand'' us better than do friends or
family members, though spouses edge them out in this category.
Thirty-one percent believe that pets understand us best. Eleven
percent chose friends, and another 11 percent selected family
members. The most, 47 percent, say their spouse or significant
other understands us best.
</P>
<P>
   We may be goofy in love, but we have some limits . . . really. A
full 79 percent of pet owners did (itals)not(unitals) make Y2K
contingency plans for their pets. What would that have been anyway?
A bunker with a three-month supply of Snausages? Filling the tub to
the brim with catnip before midnight strikes? And if one needs any
more evidence that we are not over the top _ 99 percent do not have
a Web site for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of us have, though, sung or danced with our pets. I'd
like to know the percentage of mothers who have yelled, ``Will you
please leave that poor dog alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Many pet owners even think they know what kind of music pets
enjoy. While 26 percent said pets had ``no preference,'' 16 percent
own ``easy listening'' pets; 16 percent are classical cats; and 10
percent are pop pups.
</P>
<P>
   And if pets like music and dancing, they're sure to love a
party. Eighty-seven percent of us include pets in holidays, and, of
those, 98 percent celebrate Christmas, 20 percent Valentine's Day,
and only 1 percent Passover. (There's something odd here. That's
the same percentage of owners who have tried color therapy for
their pets, for crying out loud.)
</P>
<P>
   We give them love and attention (97 percent); bring them to the
vet (92 percent); cook for them (52 percent); clean their teeth (46
percent); hire pet sitters for them (60 percent); and groom them
(61 percent).
</P>
<P>
   And boy, do we talk about them. In answering the question ``Whom
do you talk about with co-workers most,'' 20 percent said spouse,
23 percent said kids, and 34 percent picked pet.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from the survey is, this is all (itals)perfectly
normal.(unitals)

WALIGN FEATURE ALLOWS THE FILES ON HARD DISK TO BE STORED FASTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: There is an entry in my Windows 98 Task Scheduler
called ``Tune-up Application Start.'' The properties identify this
as WALIGN. A ``Find files'' search for WALIGN shows WALIGN.EXE in
the windowssystem folder. Can you please tell me what WALIGN is and
what it does?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the neat little tricks that Windows 98 can do is
change the way your files are stored on a hard disk so they load
faster if you are using the FAT32 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   How it does this is fairly technical _ it has to do with
rewriting the file headers, which are essentially information about
a file's properties and how it gets stored on the disk. If you want
more details, try this Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q191/6/55.ASP.
</P>
<P>
   A more advanced version, WINALIGN, comes with the Windows 98
Resource Kit, a thick book with lots of technical details on the
operating system, as well as a CD-ROM with some advanced goodies.
WINALIGN can work with more programs than WALIGN, which is largely
limited to operating system files.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the Norton Utilities on your system, it will do
something similar when you run its disk defragmentation program,
SpeedDisk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw your advice about cutting down on the time it takes to
make a connection when dialing into the Internet. I use Juno, and I
tried to follow your instructions, but there is no entry in my
Dialup Networking folder.
</P>
<P>
   A: The tip on changing some dialup networking settings to cut
down on connection time
(www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/414879) applies only to the
standard Windows 95/98 dialer. It does not apply to America Online,
Juno and other services that use their own dialing scheme. You'll
need to check with their tech support services if you are having
problems connecting.
</P>
<P>
   However, in most cases, problems making a connection quickly _
or getting a fast connection _ are due to some predictable factors.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that your software has not properly recognized your
modem, a regular problem with AOL's software. It could be that the
phone lines in your house, or those between you and your provider,
have a problem. Or you may need to update your modem's drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I loved your column on Windows' problems with system
resources (www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/421984). But I had a
hard time typing in the Web address you ran for the older column on
how to turn off background programs. I finally got to it from the
Houston Chronicle's Web site. Was it wrong in the paper?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it was correct. But one thing readers sometimes do with
Web addresses they see in the is to include the hyphens that appear
at the end of a line. Don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   We use hyphens to break long Web addresses from one line to the
next, just as we break long words to the next line. Just as you
wouldn't misspell a long word you saw in the newspaper with a
hyphen at the end of a line, don't add end-of-line hyphens you see
in Web addresses, either.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you only have to type in one address _
www.chron.com/technology (with no hyphen). That will take you
straight to the Chronicle's online version of our section, and all
the links there are live. Just click and go.

NATIONAL PARKS CAN LEARN FROM TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ There's a real possibility the next president of the
United States will be a Texan. If so, let's hope he doesn't forget
how Texas funds its parks and does likewise on the national level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Texas Legislature decided it didn't have enough
money to provide free parks for everyone. So except for a small tax
on recreational equipment, the Legislature no longer funds park
operations. They told the Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife people to generate
most of their budget with visitor fees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 23 of the 41 state parks are self-sufficient.
Realistically, eight to 10 more will probably move into
self-sufficiency in the near future, park officials say. There are
81 additional recreation areas, historic sites and natural areas
that probably never will pay their way because of limited
facilities or ecological concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The department also has set up the Parks and Wildlife Foundation
to raise $12.5 million for endowments. Profits from the endowment
will go to help pay park operating costs. An additional $12.5
million is sought to fund new parks. So far, the foundation has
raised $5.8 million in the two funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AGENCIES CHARGE MINIMAL FEES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is still, mostly, doing it the old way.
While the National Park Service, which controls 83 million acres of
land, is the prime recreation agency of the federal government, it
isn't the only one. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management together have 455 million acres of land. They get about
a billion visitors each year, compared with 290 million visits to
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The three do charge minimal fees to visitors. The National Park
Service fees cover about 7 percent of its operating budget. The
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management spends $355
million more a year managing recreation than they collect in fees
from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what's so wrong about that? Shouldn't the parks be free?
After all, we're paying for them with our tax money. In a world of
infinite money, that would be the best solution. Unfortunately,
despite rising budgets, our national parks are falling apart,
according to a study by PERC, a Bozeman, Mont., think tank that
advocates free-market solutions for environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yellowstone's sewer system is obsolete, spewing raw sewage
into trout streams.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than a quarter of the national park buildings are in poor
or dilapidated condition.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Forest Service has an $8.5 billion road maintenance
backlog.
</P>
<P>
   _ On many days Yosemite must restrict entry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONGRESS SKIMPS ON MAINTENANCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress appropriates the budget for national recreation. And it
skimps on money for maintenance. Members of Congress like to see
things built so they can pose at the ribbon cutting. So we get the
$333,000 outhouse at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area or
the new employee housing at Yosemite at $580,000 per unit _ two to
four times the average building cost in the area. Meanwhile, most
Yosemite employees live in tent-cabins without running water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress authorized a fee demonstration project that
allows the three agencies mentioned, plus the Fish and Wildlife
Service, to choose up to 100 sites in which new or higher fees
could be charged. At least 80 percent of the fees stay with the
site instead of going back to the federal general fund.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the General Accounting Office says the program is a
qualified success. Revenues from fees have doubled while visits
were up by 5 percent and surveys found 83 percent of visitors were
satisfied with the fees they paid or thought they were too low.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the increased fees can be used to improve
maintenance, build facilities, increase law enforcement, or any
worthwhile cause that the park manager, who is, after all, on the
spot, thinks will enhance the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The fee demonstration project ends next year. It should be made
permanent and expanded to all federal recreational programs. That
would allow agencies to make long-term plans _ including
interagency agreements where one fee could be collected for
admission to neighboring facilities.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be national parks that can't be
self-sufficient. But wherever possible, they should fund operations
out of visitor fees. That would encourage park managers to charge
appropriate fees, cut costs and maintain facilities to attract
Americans, not turn them away.

TOYS KEEP GETTING BETTER FOR GAMERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Last year _ seems as though it was in the last
century, doesn't it? _ I took a look at the state of the art in 3-D
graphics cards for personal computers. This is a technology
category that's moving at tornadic speeds, so what was cutting edge
just a few months ago is a blunt butter knife today.
</P>
<P>
   If you blink, you'll miss the developments in the world of 3-D
graphics accelerators. Advances are coming so quickly that software
can't keep up. There are only a handful of titles out there _ all
games _ that can take advantage of some of the features the
hardware can offer.
</P>
<P>
   And get this: Today's cards are, to a certain extent,
stepping-stone products. Later this year we'll see video boards
that are capable of producing even smoother, more lush-looking
action.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, you'll have to content yourself with products like
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rage Fury Maxx, $299, ATI Technologies. This is one of those
products that sounds incredibly impressive when you hear about it
or see the specifications on paper. But I found that, in some
cases, this board with two graphics chips and double the usual
video memory doesn't quite live up to its numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Most high-end video cards today have a single processor and 32
megabytes of video memory, and that's easily enough to happily run
most games you see on the software shelf. The Maxx, on the other
hand, comes with a pair of ATI's Rage 128 chips _ each with its own
cooling fan! _ and 64 megabytes of high-speed video memory.
</P>
<P>
   The card works by having each chip handle alternating frames in
a moving image. In theory, this speeds up the process of rendering
3-D images because each chip has less work to do than if it was
handling all the graphics on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when running tests using id Software's Quake III Arena _
easily the most graphics-challenging title out there _ the Rage
Fury Maxx was able to display more frames per second than the other
card reviewed here, Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Annihilator.
</P>
<P>
   I tested these cards using the timedemo feature in Quake III,
which runs a demo at top speed and then displays an average number
of frames per second. I set the game to be fairly challenging,
running at a resolution of 1,024-by-768 pixels, and displaying
textures in 32-bit colors. This was on a Dell Dimension computer
with a 500-megahertz Pentium III processor and 256 MB of memory.
</P>
<P>
   This gave me a consistent rate of 43.7 frames a second, which
was significantly more than the Annihilator. Since the human eye
can't see more than 30 frames a second, this should guarantee
smooth gameplay.
</P>
<P>
   The other specifications on paper also indicate this should be
one responsive card. It has a 500-megapixel fill rate, meaning it
can display 500 million pixels on the screen in a second _ more
than enough for the most demanding games. It can display 16.7
million colors in 3-D games up to 1,600-by-1,200 pixels. It fully
supports Microsoft's DirectX and the OpenGL graphics schemes.
</P>
<P>
   When playing Quake III Arena, however, I found the card to be a
bit sluggish. In scenes with lots of action, the graphics felt
ragged _ something I did not experience with the Annihilator at the
same settings.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the Maxx with other games that weren't as
graphics-intensive, such as LucasArts' Star Wars Episode I Racer
and Epic's Unreal Tournament. Both of these use DirectX for 3-D
rendering, while Quake III uses OpenGL. These two games ran
beautifully, so it's possible that the Maxx's OpenGL drivers need
some tweaking. At this writing, ATI has not updated the Maxx's
drivers since the board began shipping, and maybe an update will
fix this problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxx also comes with hardware-based acceleration for DVD
drives, a nice feature for those who like to watch DVD movies on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3D Blaster Annihilator, $249, Creative Labs. This card is the
successor to the 1999 Attaboy-winning 3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra. It
uses nVidia's GeForce 256 chip, which the guys in the Marketing
Department have dubbed a ``GPU,'' for Graphics Processing Unit.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the GeForce chip handles something once left to a
PC's main chip, a process called transform and lighting. Simply
put, transform refers to the changes 3-D objects undergo in a
moving scene, and lighting is how those objects are lit. These are
mathematics-intensive processes that put a heavy burden on a chip,
so moving them off the main chip frees it to do other things.
</P>
<P>
   The Annihilator comes with 32 MB of memory, and has a fill rate
of 480 megapixels. The card is clocked at 166 MHz (ATI doesn't
reveal the Maxx's speed), but an overclocking utility built into
the drivers lets you push it higher.
</P>
<P>
   I got Quake III numbers of 34.5 frames a second using Creative's
drivers. I thought this was a bit low, so I installed the generic
reference drivers offered by nVidia, and came up with about 37
frames a second.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was less than the Maxx, the Annihilator played
much more smoothly, with none of the raggedness I felt in on the
ATI card. It was a much more satisfying experience. Unreal
Tournament and Star Wars Racer also played beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The Annihilator is a bare-bones card _ no built-in DVD support,
TV-out or other bells and whistles. It's a card for the serious
gamer.
</P>
<P>
   Creative also sells a pricier version of this card called the
Annihilator Pro, which features a supercharged type of memory
dubbed Double Data Rate, or DDR. This essentially doubles the speed
at which information is pushed through the card's memory.
</P>
<P>
   I tried out two of these cards, but neither of them would work
on my computer. I got bizarre, flashing textures in Quake III Arena
and then a solid lockup each time I ran the game. I'm working with
Creative's tech support to solve the problem, and will let you know
what this puppy can do once I make it work.

IOWA VS. N.H.: CAUSE AND EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we last tried to guess what effect Iowa's
go-stand-in-the-corner-and-vote-for-your-guy caucuses might have on
New Hampshire's primary elections, only a handful of geeks knew
anything about the Internet, ``impeachment'' referred to Nixon and
not Clinton, and NASDAQ sounded like a bombing target from Desert
Storm. Four years can be (itals)two(unitals) lifetimes in politics.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 o'clock Monday night, everything changes anew. All the
polls, punditry, and persiflage gets pitched into the recycling
bins of journalism. Because for the first time since '96, real
people begin casting real votes for president. And we know there
will be some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa frequently picks winners that New Hampshire rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Heads should roll in Journalismland if George W. Bush and Al
Gore don't easily top their party charts in Iowa when headcounts
are phoned to Des Moines. And the noggins of pollsters will be
separated from shoulders of pollsters if those matching
20-points-plus leads of the two front-runners are eviscerated.
</P>
<P>
   The labor unions have 100,000 card carriers in Iowa, and the
unions are backing Gore to the hilt. The antiabortion forces are
also strong in Iowa's Republican grass roots, but they are split
among the four GOP also-rans, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin
Hatch, and Alan Keyes, the fiery talk-show alum who seemed over the
weekend to be riding a mini-surge. None of those four pose much of
a threat to Bush, however, who is worried most about Arizona
Senator John McCain, the target of a Bush onslaught on New
Hampshire TV.
</P>
<P>
   McCain basically bailed out of Iowa early, figuring his
loudly-proclaimed opposition to the ethanol subsidy (corn turns
into motor fuel via the alchemy of taxpayer-subsidized dollars)
doomed his chance to woo Iowa corn growers. As a result, McCain
spent what the Political Hot Line adds up to only three days in
Iowa. Forbes (60 days) and Bill Bradley (59 days) were wooing Iowa
so long they could have registered to vote. Gore was out there 41
days _ and Al has a day job. Even Bush (30 days) could have
registered out of a Des Moines hotel room, like his old man used to
do in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bradley forces are discovering is that even a
media-favored candidacy upon which money is showered is no match
for an organization of ground troops. Iowa and New Hampshire are
both tractor-pull events. As a sitting vice president, with a boss
whose last-minute string-pulling (Hey, Al, want me to announce my
health care scheme the week before Iowa? Any other goodies you want
stirred into my last State of the Union speech?) is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   All those balding Baby Boomers who wrote checks for Bradley to
outpace Gore's fund-raising last quarter are not showing up in
Waterloo and Laconia to flog phones and crank up snowmobiles to get
out the vote. People still count, on the ground, more than polls,
punditry, or PAC tallies. One of the Gore New Hampshire brain
trusters questions the accuracy of this season's polling. Phone
banks and survey-takers have trouble getting at real voters.
Answering machines and services and caller ID make it harder. And
thousands of TV and radio spots only add to the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   The economy _ gangbusters in southern New Hampshire, less robust
in rural Iowa _ has had the effect of dampening interest and
presumably turnout. People are less interested this time around.
The electorate seems fat and happy, on the one hand, with consumer
confidence up and unemplopyment down. But voters are apathetic and
cynical, on the other hand, wrung out by the travails of Clinton
and the wrangling in Gridlock Center, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how we try, the journalists always miss something that
becomes apparent after New Hampshire. What's our mistake this time?
Do we under-rate McCain or Bradley? Is there actually some reason
to believe that Steve Forbes could win the nomination? Are the
lights really going out on everyone but Bush and Gore? Can this
thing really be decided over the next two weeks? Do we have to put
up with Bush and Gore for 10 months straight? Is it too late to
bring back Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Gore last week claimed the endorsement of liberal icon John
Kenneth Galbraith, who worked with Gore's daddy six decades back,
before young Albert (51) was even thought of. ``His father was one
of my great supporters (in Congress) when I ran the National Price
Stabilization in 1941 and '42,'' Galbraith said. ``I've known the
family through three generations, the children at Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   So why Gore? ``He has the experience, he has the good sense, and
has a commitment on world issues, including arms control, which is
very good in my view,'' said the Sage of Cambridge. ``I think we
can count on Al Gore not to be reckless in all this conversation
about the (United States as the) world's Great Power.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Ken, wither goeth this super-sizzlin' economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who makes a firm prediction on that is deeply
suspect,'' boomed the author of 40-odd books (I don't mean odd, I
mean (itals)plus(unitals) ). ``We do know that for the last 300
years we've had a successon of booms and busts. We should not
assume that history has come to an end. We can count on Al Gore.''
And then, ever mindful that an endorsement from Harvard's Olympian
throne can be a double-edged sword, Galbraith winked: ``I wouldn't
accuse him of in any way of being subject to my instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching his 92d birthday, Galbraith signed off thus:
``Nobody should take age seriously. I'm the world's leading
opponent of the `still' syndrome. You know: `Are you still working?
Still thinking? Still alive'?''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bradley and McCain can somehow turn their anticipated
Iowa defeats into unanticipated New Hampshire victories, the press
and the pols of their own party will be all over them: Are
(itals)you(unitals) still alive?

FRANCE'S BRITTANY COAST STILL SUFFERS FROM EFFECTS OF OIL SPILL  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE CROISIC, France _ Jerome Guiheneuf works for this little
fishing village on the Brittany coast tending to its parks and
gardens. But these days, he can usually be found on the beach in a
disposable white jumpsuit, which from a distance makes him look
like an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, the work he is doing, trying to scoop and scrape tons
of gluey black oil off the sand and the rocks, has taken its toll.
He is splattered with the stuff and it smells bad. He says there is
nothing much to be done about it. He is out here with every
municipal worker who can be spared: the electricians, the
carpenters, the painters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such demoralizing work,'' Guiheneuf said leaning on his
shovel. ``It breaks our hearts to see this. Even when the beach
looks clean, it isn't. You see a little glob and underneath there
is more. It will be here for years, sticking to our feet.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what almost everyone in Le Croisic is worried about. It
is the same up and down the coast here. More than 200 miles of
beachfront have been splattered with the thick, crude oil since the
tanker Erika broke up in stormy seas 65 miles off the coast on Dec.
12. The oil lapping ashore has the consistency of hot tar. It
clings to everything, a shimmering black menace stretching its
tentacles over white sand and usually mossy-green boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the oyster beds along the coast have been polluted. The
salt beds could be ruined soon. And the hundreds of thousands of
tourists who pour into these towns each summer may look elsewhere
this year, which would be a financial disaster for everyone here,
including Le Croisic's 4,300 year-round inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   French officials have promised that the oil will be cleaned up
by the end of March. More than 800 soldiers have been sent to
shovel, and work programs for the unemployed have directed their
efforts at the beaches, too. Everywhere it seems, the shoreline is
interrupted by tractors, huge steel vats, cranes and trucks ready
to carry the foul-smelling oil debris away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Erika oil spill is only one of France's recent
disasters. The country is also trying to recover from the two
fierce December storms that destroyed a quarter of the country's
electric grid, and knocked about 270 million trees to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The people here fear they will be forgotten. In the early days
of the spill, thousands of volunteers turned up on the beaches
ready to pitch in with the clean up. But that was during the
holidays. Now everyone is back at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you see the forests near Paris fixed up before we get
taken care of,'' said Guiheneuf. His colleagues nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Lemerle, the president of Le Croisic's Tourism Office,
sounds near to desperate. He has done a survey on reservations this
year comparing them with last year's. They are down 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe France is in a state because of the storms,'' said
Lemerle, ``But people do usually make vacation plans six months
ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   France is still investigating what happened to the Erika. A
preliminary report issued last week found that the spill was
probably caused by a rusty bulkhead. At first the crew, all Indian
citizens, were detained. But they have since been absolved of blame
and released.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has focused instead on the French company
TotalFina for hiring the Maltese-registered vessel. Investigators
found that at least one other oil company, Shell, had rejected the
Erika as unseaworthy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac toured the Le Croisic beaches on
Thursday and sat down to talk with local officials. Some apologized
for their crankiness. But the list of complaints they presented was
long. Some said they heard the government was going to help them,
but when they called local offices nothing was in place.
</P>
<P>
   One fisherman, Pascal Chillet, described the regulations
governing his work, including the various temperatures for holding
bins and the inside of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to ask you,'' Chillet said. ``How is it that I have to
follow all these rules and this boat is allowed out in such a state
of disrepair?''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac promised that France would push for international rules
including banning old and single-hulled vessels like the Erika from
European ports and the implementation of a Europe-wide monitoring
system. But some of those who listened were not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see,'' said Phillipe Genot, who works in a fish store
in town and has lately spent his days answering questions from
customers concerned about his products. ``Politicians talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Erika broke in two, spilling 10,000 to 12,000 tons of heavy
fuel into the sea. After floating for 15 days, the fuel was brought
into shore when two storms rolled into Europe over the Christmas
holiday. Clean-up efforts have so far picked up more than 75,000
tons of a mixture of oil, sand, stones, and water. Experts estimate
that about 10 percent of it is oil. For the time being, it sits in
storage. No one knows what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of oil spilled is far smaller than when the Amoco
Cadiz dumped 220,000 tons of light fuel north of here in 1978. It
is smaller too than the Exxon Valdez spill, which dumped 44,000
tons of light fuel off the coast of Alaska. But some
environmentalists say that the size of the Erika spill belies the
damage the heavier fuel can do. Bruno Rebelle, the director general
of the environmental organization Greenpeace France pointed out
that the Erika spill has already killed thousands more birds than
the Amoco spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighter fuel evaporates,'' Rebelle said. ``It is more
toxic but it goes away faster. This heavy fuel is just not
biodegradable and there is a cancer factor if it accumulates in the
food chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebelle said Chirac's optimism about having clean beaches within
two months went too far. ``Some of the towns in this area are going
to be asking the children not to dig deep in the sand this
summer,'' he said. ``We know part of the fuel will stay 10 or 20
centimeters under. It is possible that you will no longer be able
to see the oil in two months. But it does not mean that the
ecological destruction is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the beach, the workers agreed. Yann Drouin, 22, usually
just collects unemployment benefits. But he volunteered to shovel
for a salary of about $500 a month. Drouin, who lives 40 miles away
said that pitching in made him feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I would rather not do this work,'' said Drouin. ``I
would rather this mess wasn't here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 32, married, and have a newborn. Our goals include
paying for a substantial part of our child's education, paying off
our mortgage before retirement, and retiring at age 60. My salary
is $101,000. We have $30,000 in a 401(k) account invested in
Fidelity Growth and Income fund, and $2,500 in Fidelity Blue Chip
Growth fund as a start on the college fund. Our mortgage balance is
$226,000, consisting of $199,000 on a 7 percent fixed-rate mortgage
with 29 years remaining and $27,000 on a prime-plus home equity
line with 15 years remaining. Based on our purchase price, we have
$44,000 equity in the house. We also maintain $10,000 in a savings
account. Our strategy is to add $589 a month to the 401(k), with a
company match of $210; add $167 a month to the college fund; and
prepay $100 a month against each of the two mortgage accounts. I
estimate the college account will grow 9 percent annually over 18
years to $102,000; at the same growth rate the retirement account
would grow to $1,500,000 over 28 years. The mortgage should be paid
off several years before retirement. We won't be making any of the
above payments in retirement, we we should be able to live on 65
percent of current income. I'm guessing $65,000 today will be
equivalent to $150,000 in 28 years. We hope to generate the
$150,000 annual income from the $1.5 million portfolio in
retirement, without drawing upon the principal. We have not
factored in a possible pension, Social Security, salary increases,
or bonuses. Perhaps these will compensate for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Scituate, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your plan may work, but there are some troublesome elements.
Everything basically boils down to your last sentence _ the iffy
questions of pension, Social Security, and higher compensation in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   What leaps out is that you have presumed a somewhat conservative
growth rate during the years of your saving for retirement, and
then a very aggressive return from your savings once you retire.
You have also made a pretty optimistic assumption about inflation,
roughly 3 percent over 28 years. It's impossible to make an
informed projection over such a long period of time, but I'd say
3.5 percent and even suggest making a 4 percent calculation for a
bad-case (but alas not worst-case) scenario. At 3.5 percent
inflation, you'd need $170,311 to buy what $65,000 buys today; at 4
percent, $194,915.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue with your current 401(k) savings and employer
match, a 9 percent average annual return would take you to
$1,463,000 after 28 years. At a more realistic post-retirement rate
of return, say 6.5 percent, this would provide annual income of
$95,095. (I think you are too aggressive in estimating yield in
retirement, but you are also too conservative in projection
long-term growth before retirement. If you achieved average
portfolio returns of 10 percent from the 401(k) over 28 years, the
accumulation would be $1,778,633, and it would provide a $115,611
income stream, using the assumptions above.)
</P>
<P>
   Putting the college account and the mortgage prepayments aside,
your retirement savings rate is now 6.4 percent of your income. If
you could bump that to 7.5 _ an additional $98 a month _ 28-year
accumulation would be $1,913,402, based on the assumption of 10
percent portfolio growth and no additional employer matches. If you
combine that with those iffy factors mentioned at the outset, the
situation would be a lot more comfortable. Of those iffy
situations, the prime one in your control is the dollar level of
your savings, which can increase proportionately every time your
income increases.
</P>
<P>
   Miscellaneous thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   You don't say what the plus in the prime-rate plus charge on
your home equity line is, but it takes the rate well above the cost
of your first mortgage. I suggest you direct all of your $200
monthly prepayments against that account; shift the prepayments to
the first mortgage only after the home equity line is paid off.
</P>
<P>
   You would doubtless achieve substantially greater returns if you
switched most of the emergency savings account _ perhaps all but
$1,000 _ to a money market mutual fund. With such an account you
can get check-writing privileges. Given the average rate of 2.08
percent on savings accounts and the fact that most money market
funds yield over 5 percent, you could achieve a nice improvement.
Or, you could look for a tax-exempt fund and likely achieve similar
returns to what you get now, but without tax liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Your growth estimate in the college fund is pretty close,
although I come up with $97,989. Using the expense projections in
the 2000 edition of ``How to Pay for College Without Going Broke,''
which presumes a 5 percent annual escalation of college costs, a
four-year education from 2018 to 2021 would cost $231,820 at a
private college and $88,872 at a public college. Certainly you are
on the path to accumulating enough to make a substantial
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 49. We have $60,000 in mutual funds,
with $25,000 in MFS Global Growth, $12,000 in Vanguard Health Care,
and the rest in various income and growth funds. Our combined
income is $75,000; we contribute $7,000 a year to 401(k) and IRA
accounts. At 62, Social Security will pay us $1,700 a month. We
have six years left on our mortgage and no other debt.
Realistically, could we retire at 62?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Exeter, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm afraid the prospect looks fairly dim. If you continue to
the $7,000 annual savings rate and your portfolio earns average
returns of 10 percent, you would amass $386,699 over the course of
13 years. If that were then invested in a fixed-income portfolio,
it might be expected to bring you a $25,135 annual income stream.
With your Social Security benefits, that would take you to an
annual income stream of $45,535 -- which is a pretty fair cry from
$70,000 even without factoring in the effect of inflation on its
buying power. And even if you decide you could get along on $45,500
a year in retirement, that projection would leave you with no money
set aside in growth securities to protect you against the inflation
of the later years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is a bit brighter at age 65, when you would have an
accumulation of $538,922, following the same assumptions, and your
Social Security benefits would be larger.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you devoted the amount of your mortgage payment to a
supplemental retirement savings plan once it is paid off, you would
probably be significantly better off. Picking a number purely out
of my hat, if your mortgage costs you $800 a month and that amount
were put aside for the final ten years before retiring, you might
add $160,040 to the expected accumulation, again assuming average
10 percent portfolio growth.

HOUSTON: distributed became useless. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A variation of the limited-install scheme is making a comeback,
often tied to the registration of a program.
</P>
<P>
   Caere Corp., a software company founded by one of the inventors
of the microchip, Robert Noyce, requires buyers of its OmniPage Pro
product to register the software. The software can be launched 25
times without registering, and then becomes disabled. Those who've
paid to use the software must then either register electronically,
over the Internet, or by calling the company.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Miller, a senior product manager at Caere, said
customers must re-register if they want to install the product on
another machine, such as a replacement computer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that if someone tries to install an
already-registered copy on another machine, it's noted in their
database and ``we can then start making some calls to find out
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had some complaints,'' said Miller. ``But they have
not been significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Software giant Microsoft placed a similar system on some of the
early test versions of its Office 2000 productivity suite, but it
was not used on the finished version in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft has used it for versions of Office 2000 sold
in countries where piracy is more common.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft currently uses CD keys _ combinations of numbers and
letters that must be typed into a program at installation _ for its
operating systems and business products. But the company does not
require that for most of its consumer titles.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Cranton, a corporate attorney for Microsoft, said the
company eventually would like to place copy protection on all its
titles, but will not do so if it inconveniences its customers in
some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of philosophy, we first felt it was important to
build up our anti-piracy program by focusing on education, and then
enforcement,'' Cranton said.
</P>
<P>
   Those two approaches have been fairly successful, and ``the next
step would be increased copy protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Microsoft is planning the ultimate form of copy
protection _ not providing a disk at all _ for the next version of
its consumer operating system, the successor to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Current plans call for the installation components of
Millennium, the code name for the next consumer OS, to exist in a
hidden area on the computer's hard drive. When new files are needed
for an installation or a change in the setup, they will be pulled
from this area.
</P>
<P>
   Users who have system problems will have to resort to using a
restore disk from the PC manufacturer in case of a crash. Most
restore disks return a user's hard drive to the state it was in
when the machine was first brought home, erasing any accumulated
software and data.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman would not confirm that scheme. She said
the company will make a major announcement soon regarding how it
handles copy protection for its products.
</P>
<P>
   The game segment of the software industry is one of the hardest
hit by unauthorized duplication of its titles, and thus is one of
the most aggressive about using copy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Devine of id Software estimated that, for every
legitimate copy of its 1997 game Quake II that was sold, two more
were pirated in the United States. In some countries, he added, the
ratio was 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the problem for its newest title, Quake III Arena, id
decided to use copy protection that relied on the fact that the
game is usually played over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a server on the Internet to verify players was first
used in the hit 1998 game Half-Life from Valve Software. The game
first connected to servers at Won.net, an online gaming service,
before allowing players to hop onto any other servers.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme drew waves of complaints from players who felt they
were being snooped upon, as well as from people who were trying to
make pirate copies of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario played out again in late 1999 when id Software
released Quake III Arena, the latest installment in its
first-person shooter series.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, best known for creating the breakthrough adventure games
The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour, joined id last year. He came up
with and developed a software protection scheme similar to Valve's
for Quake III.
</P>
<P>
   When a user launches the game and tries to connect to a server
on the Internet, the game first sends a query to a server dubbed
monster.idsoftware.com. The server checks a code sent by the game
and, if no one else is playing with that code, allows the player to
join a game.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the code is already in use, the player is blocked.
</P>
<P>
   As with Half-Life, there were plenty of complaints early on
about the system. But Devine said that legitimate users weren't
complaining _ it was mostly from people who were trying to make
copies of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The system seems to have worked. So far, Devine said, there have
been no known, successful cracks of the system. And there have been
other signs that it's discouraging piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries where piracy is a real problem, we usually see
sales of our games go real strong for the first week, then drop off
as people quit buying the game and start making illegal copies,''
Devine said. ``That's not happened this time. Our sales are
sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of id's copy protection system has attracted the
attention of other game companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's Cranton said that company is looking at a
similar system it calls ``digital rights management'' that would
use an Internet server to verify a program's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Devine thinks copy protection is going to become more prevalent
in the software business, and even believes that a tax applied to
blank CDs and burners is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad when, for a software developer, when you walk
into a computer store and see boxes of legitimate software on one
side of the store, and the other half is filled with CD-recordable
drives, jewel cases and blank disks,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like the liberals he often excoriates, the economist
Jagdish Bhagwati passionately deplores child labor, inadequate
wages and the failure to enforce antipollution laws in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bhagwati, a committed free trader, opposes the
enforcement of intellectual property rights like software
copyrights in countries like India and Brazil. He argues that laws
against illegal immigrants already inside the United States are
``pointless.'' Leave them alone if they are already here, he says;
immigrants help the United States maintain its edge in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Forget political or ideological labels. Bhagwati, a professor of
economics and political science at Columbia University, prefers to
consider himself ``a public nuisance,'' challenging established
policies, stirring up protests and picking apart conventional
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been shy about wading into the public arena. Most
recently, Bhagwati, who was born in Bombay and is 65, gathered a
group of scholars, labor leaders and activists from Africa, Latin
America and Asia to sign a statement protesting the inclusion of
labor and environmental standards in trade deals before the World
Trade Organization met in Seattle last month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he organized a similar kind of signature campaign on the
eve of President Clinton's summit meeting with the Japanese prime
minister, enlisting leading economists, including several Nobel
Laureates, to urge Japan to reject U.S. demands for import targets.
(Japan did.)
</P>
<P>
   He has written or edited 40 books, written hundreds of articles,
and founded and edited two journals, Economics and Politics and The
Journal of International Economics. He is a favorite on evening
news programs like ABC's and on talk shows like PBS'
DebatesDebates, where he delights in skewering Ross Perot, Pat
Buchanan and fellow economists with pointed one-liners. ``If the
WTO. is dead, then necrophilia must be breaking out,'' he said
during a taping of DebatesDebates recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an olive green shirt open at the neck and a blue Kenzo
designer suit coat, Bhagwati spoke with flamboyant animation in a
makeup room after the taping.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are fine, but not enough, he said. Bhagwati also says he
wants to make the world a better place. He believes that together
democracy and free trade can deliver both economic growth and
social reform, although he concedes that growth is not inevitable
in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati, who studied economics at Cambridge and Oxford
universities, presents himself as the human face of global
laissez-faire economics. He insists that open societies can be
created without using trade sanctions as a weapon. He places his
faith in ``voluntarism,'' which would rely on the global
communications network and nongovernmental organizations to shame
companies and governments into, for example, paying workers a
living wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern civil society, modern technology has made possible
alternative instruments, other sorts of teeth,'' he said. ``Teeth
doesn't mean just trade sanctions. People underestimate the
potential of what can be done. Multinationals don't tend to abuse,
to indulge in a race to the bottom. They don't exploit every
loophole to damage the local guy in terms of their health and
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he led the writing crusade before the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, arguing that the group should be
able to oversee trade without sticky intrusions that would force it
to impose sanctions on countries that abuse workers rights. The
spreading of wealth, he argues, along with these private efforts,
will eventually create the working conditions and educational
advancement common in the industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   He works closely with Corporate Social Responsibility Standards,
an organization that seeks to give public seals of approval to
corporations that meet norms of social responsibility in their
employment practices. ``If you do anything egregious, all these
lies will come out,'' he said. ``People will write about, agitate
about it. Big firms can not afford it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that global standards, like environmental controls,
don't make sense for other reasons as well.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he has no good answer to Mexico City's
pollution (``forget about Mexico City, which has horrible
environmental problems''), he proceeds to argue that different
countries have the right to set different priorities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the rest of Mexico that has very bad water, but the
environment is a lot cleaner,'' he said. ``We have it the reverse
way. All our children carry around Perrier bottles. Our water is a
lot better, but our air is not necessarily that good. Our
priorities are different, exactly the opposite. Even if we attach
the same preference to environmental spending, it is conceivable
that the Mexican priority will be to clean up water while we would
want to clean up air.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   To Bhagwati's critics, however, he is less of an original
thinker than a confused one. ``His departures from laissez-faire
economics make him inconsistent,'' says Robert Kuttner, the
co-editor of The American Prospect magazine. ``Why is it that money
is not seen by him as another commodity? Why does he oppose the
standard view on intellectual property rights? All this is rooted
in a real concern for the third world, but does not in the end make
him a high theorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levinson, the chief economist at Union of Needle Trades
Industrial and Textile Employees, said: ``He opposes linking labor
rights or environmental protection to trade and investment
agreements. In a global economy that is becoming increasingly
integrated, this position is irresponsible. Wages are not rising in
the many parts of the developing world because workers are denied
the right to organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade and investment by itself will not raise living
standards,'' he continued. ``Look at El Salvador, Honduras, Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh. These countries have posted high employment
gains in the apparel industry while real wages have declined. In
China, foreign investment in the apparel sector has lowered wages
and working standards. The suppression of wages and failure to
enforce environmental standards creates a powerful incentive to
move jobs overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati is unfazed by criticism. He goes out of his way to
avoid simmering fights, often calling critics after reading an
attack on his work to compliment them on their good points and
assure them that he was not offended.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, he has not curbed his own sharp tongue. He
admits that, like many good rhetoricians, he plans his verbal
thrusts in advance. (He said he regretted that in Seattle he was
unable to chide Ralph Nader, the leader of a campaign against the
World Trade Organization and the author of ``Unsafe at Any Speed,''
for believing that ``the WTO is unsafe in any form.''')
</P>
<P>
   To Bhagwati, many people in the United States have fallen prey
to what he calls the ``diminished giant syndrome'': a fear that
free trade accelerates the flight of jobs. Blue-collar jobs, he
says, have been lost primarily to new technologies. Attacking the
Clinton administration's trade policies toward Japan, he wrote,
``These Clinton warriors think they are fighting the samurai when
they are facing GIs.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   He warns that the overheated American economy is headed for a
dislocation, in part because surges and dips in the market ``are
built into human nature. ``I am more than a little worried,'' he
said. ``There is so much consumption being built on this. It is
really going to take a big tumble, because people are building
capacities based on this.'' He attributes the success of vaunted
huge investors like George Soros to ``good luck'' and the ability
to ``take big bets,'' dismissing any formula to understand the
ultimate workings of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he adds: ``The economy that really worries me is China.
As they get into more democratization, as they are bound to, they
can't resist these pressures. There is going to be some upheaval
within the Communist Party. It will spill over into extensive
fights about things like privatization. It will be much more
difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own role in such debates, Bhagwati says: ``If you
want to be in the public domain, you need the courage to be
unconventional. Logic is not enough. You need wit, irony, good
anecdotes and sarcasm. It always works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been alone, but I hang in there,'' he said, adding with
his familiar mischievousness, ``Usually the world comes around.''

COMPANIES PUT NEW FOCUS ON PROTECTING AND PREVENTING SHARING OF
TITLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Installing software on a personal computer used to be
simple: Slip in a CD, click a few buttons and you were ready to
work, play or communicate.
</P>
<P>
   But software companies, concerned about how easy it's become to
share unauthorized copies of their products, are increasingly
turning to copy protection, resurrecting a hated aspect of
computing that once flourished in the early days of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of a quick setup process, users find themselves
digging through the paper that comes in software boxes, looking for
serial numbers to be typed precisely before the program will run.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the Internet is being used to verify the
legitimacy of a program, with a server passing judgment on whether
the software will be allowed to launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every software company must deal with this issue of piracy,
and they have to balance the degree of copy protection they build
in against their customers' ability to use the product,'' said
Peter Beruk, vice president of the anti-piracy division at the
Software &AMP; Information Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Copy protection is designed to make it difficult for anyone
other than a licensed user to install and run a software program.
It is used to combat the massive problem of software piracy, in
which someone makes available free or unauthorized copies of a
program.
</P>
<P>
   Beruk's association estimates that piracy costs the software
industry $11 billion annually worldwide, and about $3 billion in
the United States. Those figures apply mostly to business software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to say what the numbers are for
consumer software,'' Beruk said. ``You can't go banging on people's
doors and demanding to know if they gave a copy of a program to
their neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The software industry faces two new challenges that has inspired
it to use more copy protection _ the popularity of the Internet and
the growing number of inexpensive CD-ROM drives that can write to
as well as read from disks.
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire culture of ``warez pirates'' who establish
Web and Internet sites for the distribution of commercial software.
They produce programs that get around a title's copy protection, so
that anyone who downloads the software can use it.
</P>
<P>
   Beruk said that there also are thousands of people who are new
to computing who sign onto the Internet for the first time each
day, and they may not know that it's wrong to e-mail a copy of a
small program to a friend online.
</P>
<P>
   The use of CD-ROM ``burners,'' which can create new copies of a
CD, is becoming more prevalent. Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp.
recently added rewriteable CD drives as a standard feature on most
of its Presario consumer PCs. And add-on burners can cost as little
as $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a CD by itself was a form of copy
protection,'' said Brad Grimes, executive editor at PC World, a
personal computing magazine. ``That's not the case anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of popular copy protection schemes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The most common system requires users to enter a serial number
as part of the installation process, or on first usage. The serial
number comes on a piece of paper included in the packaging. In the
case of software that's been downloaded from the Internet, the
number may be provided by a separate e-mail, or displayed on a Web
site after the customer has paid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some software titles _ usually games _ require that users keep
the installation disk in their CD-ROM drive when launching or
running the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-priced software, such as computer-aided design titles or
software designed for specific industries, use a hardware component
called a dongle. This is usually a plug that's attached to one of
the computer's ports, such as the serial or parallel port. The
software checks to see if the dongle is present before launching
and may also check a unique code embedded in the device.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some software programs tie copy protection to their
registration schemes. When users register, information tying the
software to the computer is sent to a database, either by modem or
over the Internet. Registration is not an option _ it's required,
either immediately or after a fixed number of launches, or the
program doesn't run. Attempts to re-register the software on
another machine require a phone call to the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some multiplayer game developers have moved to a system that
requires Internet-based verification of the game each time the user
tries to connect to a server to play. The game sends an
authorization code to the server, which checks to see if anyone
else is currently playing with the same code. If the code is
already in use, the player is not allowed to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say these forms are mild compared to copy
protection used in the earliest days of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this was most frustrating for consumers,'' Beruk said.
``I remember at a certain point in one computer program, a box
popped up and you had to go type in a bold-faced word on page 178
of the manual in order to continue using the software. That was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other now-defunct copy protection schemes included elaborate
codes included in a title's box. For example, Sierra On-Line's
Leisure Suit Larry series required users to match obscure
characters in order to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   (The Leisure Suit Larry games are still popular, and people
still lose the sheet with the codes. Sierra has posted a copy of
the codes for Leisure Suit Larry 5 on its Web site at
www.sierra.com/support/technical/productdocuments/lsl5copy.html.)
</P>
<P>
   Some titles only allowed users to install software a fixed
number of times. The popular PFS:File and PFS:Write products from
Software Publishing Corp., circa 1985, limited installations this
way. After several installs, the floppy disk on which the title was
distributed became useless.

WITH CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN TROUBLE, SOME FEAR LARGER CRISIS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ German Christian Democracy has had two basic
functions: to defeat the left and to present a conservative front
broad enough to marginalize any extreme-right movement. Now, with
the party in crisis, fears are mounting that Germany's rightist
fringe parties will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hardly believe how quickly public interest in our party
has grown,'' Rolf Schlierer, the leader of the far-right
Republikaner party said in a statement. ``The conservative members
of the Christian Democratic party are looking for an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlierer offered no figures to support a statement also
trumpeting the populist slogan that ``politicians are not entitled
to better treatment than ordinary taxpayers.'' The nationalist
right remains far beyond the German mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But concern is palpable that the unmasking of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats as a party with contempt for the
law could shake the relatively shallow roots of German democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to turn our attention to the fact that the crisis
of the Christian Democratic Union could mushroom into a crisis of
party democracy,'' the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, born of the discovery of millions of dollars
illegally donated in secret to the Christian Democrats, has erupted
at a time of uncertain flux in Germany _ from Bonn to the ``Berlin
Republic'' and from post-war tutelage to the responsibilities of
power. These shifts are still in progress, making the country more
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the worst crisis the Federal Republic has
known,'' said Fritz Stern, a historian at Columbia University.
``What has been shaken is the most elementary trust, and so finding
any recourse is much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust took another blow on Friday as Roland Koch, the Christian
Democratic premier of the state of Hesse, announced that of 7.8
million marks ($4.04 million) illegally transferred into overseas
accounts by the party, 4.3 million marks had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you where it went,'' Koch said. ``It is an open
question right now.'' Asked if the money had been stolen, he
replied, ``I don't want to accuse anyone of that, but I cannot rule
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement might have seemed outlandish even a few weeks ago.
But Germany has had to adjust its self-image to include prominent
politicians accepting bags of cash with apparent alacrity, and Kohl
placing his ``honor'' above the law by refusing to name the people
who gave him more than $1 million in secret payments.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently exasperated by Kohl's stance, two Christian Democrat
politicians suggested on Friday that the law could be used to force
the former chancellor to reveal the identities he is hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The party is facing heavy punitive fines for its actions, and so
one course might be to sue the former chancellor for damages. Asked
about a lawsuit against Kohl, his successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
said on Friday that, ``If we can isolate and identify damages done,
we must address the issue of whether to demand damages from
whoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiner Geissler, a former general-secretary of the party,
suggested a slightly different legal course: pursuing Kohl for
``breach of trust,'' specifically the trust placed in him by
members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Neither course will be straightforward because German law tends
to punish a party rather than an individual for crimes like failing
to declare contributions of more than $10,500 _ a transgression of
which Kohl, by his own admission, was repeatedly guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that the party is talking about suing the man
seen only two months ago as a statesman in the same class as Konrad
Adenauer, the distinguished post-war chancellor and founder of the
party, suggests the distance that Christian Democracy _ and Germany
as a whole _ has travelled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The talk of legal action appeared particularly significant
because the aspect of the scandal that has most shocked Germans has
been the light it has cast on how Kohl apparently valued power and
loyalty higher than his oath of office and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law is of course fundamental to the functioning of
any democratic state. But in Germany _ traumatized by Hitler's
trampling of the law, reconstructed with a sort of veneration for
the values of the post-war constitution _ the flaunting of the law
by figures in high public office has a particularly disconcerting
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Grundgesetz'' or ``Basic Law, approved in 1949
at the foundation of the Federal Republic, has become a text of
pivotal importance to German identity. Bereft of the possibility of
any other patriotism after Hitler, liberal Germans discovered what
Jurgen Habermas famously called a ``constitutional patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   That patriotism was rooted in the success of the post-war
republic and the success of its new legal framework offering a true
separation of powers and legal guarantees of civil rights and
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   It is the confidence borne of these successes that, for now,
seems to lie in tatters, prompting the fears that the implosion of
the Christian Democratic party could threaten party democracy
itself. For if the country's most important statesman of the past
two decades cares little for the law, why should ordinary Germans
care more?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a half-century of democratic tradition will not be
quickly erased. But the longer Kohl maintains his silence _ so
prolonging the crisis of his party and the country's crisis of
trust _ the more fragile the situation may become.
</P>
<P>
   The traumatic impact of the crisis was captured on Thursday by
the suicide of Wolfgang Huellen, the head of the Christian
Democratic Union parliamentary group's budget and finance
department. The Berlin public prosecutor confirmed on Friday that
it had opened an investigation, but declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wackers, a lawyer for the family, said the reason for
the death was not private but political. ``His private affairs gave
him no reason to take his own life.'' Several newspapers have
reported that his suicide note referred to the financial dealings
of the party and possible embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls published on Friday showed the Christian Democrats
with between 32 percent and 36 percent of the vote, trailing
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats by about 10
percent. Two months ago, the Christian Democrats enjoyed a 13
percent lead with about 45 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That is a huge political setback but not yet a complete
collapse. How long and how deep the plunge will be now seems to
depend, more than ever, on the chancellor of German unity.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing in Bremen on Friday, Kohl showed no sign of
changing his position. ``In all these long years, one thing is
certain,'' he said. ``I was not and am not corrupt or for sale.''

MEET THE SUPERHEROES OF SUBURBIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Note italics in final graf. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After so thoroughly flaming out with the 1993 flop ``Meteor
Man,'' it's a wonder actor/director Robert Townsend would return to
the subject of superheroes. But his gamble pays off modest
dividends with the Disney Channel comedy ``Up, Up and Away,'' a
story about a suburban family that just happens to be made up of
costumed crime fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend and Alex Datcher star as Jim and Judy Marshall, an
average couple who, should someone, say, rob a nearby bank,
shoehorn themselves into leather and spandex and become Bronze
Eagle and Warrior Woman. The mother and father of three are such a
married couple that they nonchalantly bicker while battling their
foes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, their Kryptonite is aluminum foil, which makes one wonder
how they could possibly stop crime in a school cafeteria or their
own kitchen. Super powers run in the family _ their oldest son has
super-speedy powers, and their young daughter terrorizes the whole
brood with her laser eyebeams.
</P>
<P>
   But one son, Scott (Michael J. Pagan), is approaching his 14th
birthday with nary a differently abled toenail. Since this is
accepted to be the cut-off date to accrue super powers, all
involved are understandably concerned: Mom and Pop wonder if Scott
might be _ gasp! _ normal.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the fact that a sinister team of
computer whizzes are plotting to brainwash the community's kids
into doing their evil bidding for them. If ever there was a time
Scott could use some super powers, it's now. But what if none are
forthcoming?
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, Up and Away'' offers a lot of cute throwaway gags for
parents while offering kids an important lesson on accepting
yourself even if you can't meet the expectations your parents set
for you. Thankfully, even such a sophisticated lesson goes down
easily amid such inspired silliness as a party for superheroes and
Scott's nerdy friend who, upon beholding Warrior Woman's
ultra-sleek, crime-busting motorcycle, laments, ``Aw, geez, (BEGIN
ITAL)my(END ITAL)! mom drives a hatchback.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Up, Up and Away.'' &QL; 
What: Comedy about a family of superheroes. &QL; 
The stars: Robert Townsend, Michael J. Pagan, Alex Datcher and
Sherman Hemsley. &QL; 
Where: Disney Channel. &QL; 
When: 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. Saturday; also Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday

ON AN ILLICIT CARNATION: A SMUGGLER'S REFLECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 23)  
(Eds., optional sidebar at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was already in line in the customs area at Miami International
Airport when I realized I was in violation of the law. I was a
smuggler, carrying contraband on my person. Well, on my hat anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant in Mexico City where I'd eaten lunch before
catching my flight home made a practice of giving each woman a
fresh flower. I stuck the bright red carnation in the band of my
straw hat. It was still there, albeit a bit wilted, when I
confidently signed the customs declaration, affirming that I wasn't
attempting to bring any fresh produce or plant material into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   The carnation trafficking episode happened almost two decades
ago. It came back to mind, generating a fresh flush of guilt, when
I heard about the discovery of a devastating fruit-tree virus in
Pennsylvania. The virus, called plum pox, is widespread in Europe
and has been identified in India, northern Africa and Chile. But it
was unknown in North America until last October, when it was
identified in several orchards in Adams County, in south-central
Pennsylvania, one of the state's main fruit-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   The virus affects stone-fruit trees, including peaches, plums
and apricots. It drastically reduces yield, and the foliage and
fruit of an infected tree are covered with unsightly lesions. The
disease also affects ornamentals like flowering plums and weeping
peaches as well as fruit-producing trees. There's no cure, and the
only way to control the disease is to destroy trees that carry the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The great mystery is how the disease got to Adams County. Plum
pox is so serious that federal laws forbid importing stone-fruit
trees or budwood, which is grafting material, from Europe unless it
has gone through a stringent quarantine. Researchers have found no
evidence that any of the affected Adams County orchards got plant
material from any infected region.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible for plum pox to spread naturally. The virus is
carried by aphids, which spread it by feeding first on an infected
plant and then on an uninfected one. Plum pox can infect wild
fruits as well as domesticated ones, and it has other hosts, like
white clover and several members of the nightshade family.
</P>
<P>
   When the disease was identified in Chile in 1996, plant
pathologists estimated it would reach North America in about 20
years by natural means, despite aggressive eradication programs and
quarantines.
</P>
<P>
   But it's likely that plum pox was already in Pennsylvania in
1996. That's when Adams County orchardists say they started
noticing the symptoms. The disease went undiagnosed for three years
for the simple reason that no one expected to find plum pox in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it get here? Quite possibly by the carnation route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it came from a nurseryman,'' said Dr. Herb Cole,
an agriculture extension specialist at Pennsylvania State
University. ``It could have come from an ornamental plant.'' Cole
noted that researchers have traced the sources of all tree stock in
the infected orchards and found nothing suspicious. Samples from
Adams County tree nurseries also have been negative.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, a member of the state's plum pox task force, says the
original source of the virus might have been one of its alternate
hosts, possibly an ornamental perennial or annual that was imported
legitimately. It's a plausible explanation, given the sharp
increase in plant material moving through international channels,
an increase that has, in some cases, far outstripped inspection
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, it might have come in on budwood, cuttings, roots
or whole plants brought in illegally and surreptitiously by an
amateur horticulturist _ the type of miscreant Cole calls ``a sock
smuggler.'' That would be _ gulp _ people like me.
</P>
<P>
   My carnation was an innocent infraction, but there was another
time when my suitcase contained the seeds of a particularly fine
poblano chili, bought in a market in Veracruz and seeded in my
hotel room. I've never brought in scions, cuttings or plant
divisions with soil attached, but I'm not going to say I've never
been tempted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous temptation. The plant material may look healthy
enough, but many of the most serious viral diseases are difficult
to spot. For example, the symptoms of plum pox appear on the fruit
and foliage, not the woody tissues. A gardener who brings back a
cutting or two of a particularly nice variety of stone fruit from
Spain or France to graft to a backyard tree would have no way of
knowing whether the cuttings are infected.
</P>
<P>
   If the infection is in an alternate host, such as a species of
Solanum, which includes ornamental peppers, eggplants and
nicotiana, there might be no visible symptoms at all.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of bringing in a foreign pest or disease may be
small, but the consequences can be enormous. It's not worth the
risk, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To the best of my knowledge, my contraband carnation didn't
adversely affect the dianthus industry in the United States. I got
my comeuppance anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In my uncertainty about whether to declare the illegal blossom,
I must have appeared nervous enough to match some customs profile.
The agent marked my declaration form with a large circled ``D'' and
sent me off to the search room.
</P>
<P>
   There, customs personnel emptied every piece of luggage and
minutely examined every scrap of my personal belongings. They found
nothing to warrant their suspicion. But only because they never
even glanced at my hatband.
</P>

   If you've neglected formative training of young trees, evaluate
them with pruning saw in hand. Maples bleed if pruned when not
fully dormant, and other favorite natives like black gum (Nyssa
sylvatica), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum) and most oaks should
also be pruned when it's otherwise too cold to be outside.
</P>
<P>
   Check stored dahlias, cannas, and caladiums. If any pieces have
rotted, discard them, and keep the peat or vermiculite they're
stored in drier and cooler. If it's too dry, sprinkle with water.

   Combat dry air indoors by creating an oasis for houseplants:
cluster them on watertight trays covered with pebbles and partly

 &HT;    Flood victims' mail awaits pick up
 &HT;    By Judy Royal
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Thousands of pieces of mail unclaimed by
flood victims are waiting to be picked up at two Greenville
locations of the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Many people displaced by the flood are unaware that postal
officials are still holding mail sent to them as long as four
months ago when Hurricane Floyd caused many to flee their homes,
never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to know where their mail is, and they can
still come and get it,'' said Bobbi Fretwell, manager of customer
service for Greenville's postal district.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials have even retrieved and sanitized mail that was
sitting in boxes when the floodwaters rose.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 households have unclaimed mail at the the postal
station that handles areas north of the Tar River, including
Belvoir, Fretwell said. Most of those affected in the 27858 ZIP
code area are East Carolina University students and have asked the
post office to forward their mail, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because hundreds of addresses no longer exist due to the flood,
there is nowhere to deliver many flood victims' mail, postal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got whole neighborhoods that we'll never resume delivery
to,'' said Larry Taylor, officer-in-charge for Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   The post offices have been keeping this mail in individual slots
for the flooded residents, but those affected need to fill out
change-of-address forms as soon as possible so they can begin
delivering mail at the new households.
</P>
<P>
   Storing the mail since the flood has become quite a chore for
the post office, which spends about 30-40 hours per week on the
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to be a monumental project,'' Fretwell said.
</P>
<P>
   She asks that people affected by the flood go to any post office
and fill out a forwarding address order.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they are living somewhere temporarily, flood victims
should report the address to the post office, Taylor said. They can
always change it again later.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials ask that all flood victims report new addresses
by Feb. 29. If they do not, the post office may have to return the
mail to the senders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can get this mail depleted down to a point where
we can handle it,'' Taylor said. ``We don't want to send anyone's
mail back.''
</P>
<P>
   In a normal situation when people move and don't report an
address change, the post office holds their mail for 10 days before
returning to the sender, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the magnitude of the disaster makes this a special
situation, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some circumstances that were beyond anyone's control,
and we're trying to stretch the rules a little bit,'' he said. ``We
are bending the rules and we are doing some things that regulations
instruct us not to do because of the flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of other Pitt neighborhoods hit by the flood have been
picking up their mail or have filled out change-of-address forms,
postal officials from nearby towns said.
</P>
<P>
   Because communities like Grifton, Grimesland and Farmville are
small, it has been easy to get the word out about flood victims'
mail, said Jennifer Vandiford, postmaster for Grifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks have been real good to work with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail of about 300 Grifton households was affected by the
flood, but by November almost everyone had filled out forwarding
forms, Vandiford said.
</P>
<P>
   Grimesland Postmaster Lynn Zuzzolo said 147 households in her
area were affected by the flood. The post office is still holding
mail for about 30 customers who are picking it up on a regular
basis, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one or two families have unclaimed mail at the Grimesland
post office, where it will remain for a year, Zuzzolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmville Postmaster Ed Creech said his area has not had any
problems with unclaimed mail. All but 10 of the 80 displaced people
have filled out change-of-address forms, and those remaining are
picking up their mail regularly, he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds will continue to buffet parts of Maine on Saturday
as a deep low-pressure system heads into the Canadian Maritimes.
High winds will combine with arctic air to create potentially
dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the deep low, two diminutive lows, one in the
northern branch of the jet stream and the other in the southern
branch, will skirt eastward from the upper and lower Mississippi
Valleys, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the tandem of lows, milder air drawn northward over
colder air near the surface will set the stage for two main areas
of precipitation. Steady snows will develop across the upper Great
Lakes in concert with the warm front associated with the low in the
northern branch. Farther south, broken areas of generally light
snow will move eastward from across the southern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   An area of steady snow associated with the low in the southern
branch of the jet stream will spread across the Ohio Valley toward
the central and adjoining parts of the southern Appalachians. To
the south, an area of chilly rain, buffered from the snow by a thin
swath of sleet, will spread east from the Tennessee Valley. Farther
south, scattered showers will develop over parts of the central
Gulf Coast states as moist air streams north from the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a large plume of cirrus clouds will dim the sun over
parts of the Southwest. Farther north, snow will develop on
west-facing slopes of the central and northern Rockies as winds off
of the Pacific are forced to ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Zone of Storms
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, while residents of the Northeast shivered in the
latest outbreak of arctic air, the temperature in Brownsville,
Texas, rose above 80 degrees for the 14th time this month. The
juxtaposition of the unusual warmth with bitter chill in much of
the north provides the energy for vigorous storms. In recent days,
several low-pressure zones have rapidly intensified near the
Atlantic Seaboard as they traversed the zone of large temperature
difference. By the middle of next week, another important
disturbance will enter the zone, bringing the threat of a major
winter storm in the East.

<P>
   PARIS _ Nothing is more stubbornly French than the devotion to
perfect seams. One can go to any haute couture house and find the
same people bent over the same tables, pulling the same needles,
absorbed in the same conversations that, in another era, would not
have been remarkably different. Even Karl Lagerfeld, who is German
and runs the most informal couture studio in Paris, was not beyond
closing ranks when he said of his pretty Chanel spring collection,
``It's not a trip to Africa or India; it's a Paris trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in ways that nobody has bothered to notice, the real spirit
of haute couture today lies closer to the American West Coast than
uptight old Paris. The women who buy couture, who pay upward of
$50,000 for an evening dress, arrive in the front row in such a
profusion of hair and modern dentistry that it would be hilarious
if they weren't so friendly and their wealth didn't come from such
improbable new sources, like supplying those TV helicopters you see
whizzing over Los Angeles to cover traffic and police chases.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at a dinner at the U.S. Embassy given by
Ambassador Felix Rohatyn and his wife, Elizabeth, for Oscar de la
Renta, the main topic was John Galliano's show for Christian Dior.
Drawn from a nether world of tramps and mental patients, the show,
which had models draped eccentrically in newsprint-patterned silk
and straitjackets, has been a subject of debate all week in the
French media, with many pundits condemning it as insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Dior may be as French as fois gras, what could have
more in common with America's lurid taste for shock and tabloid
sensation than Galliano's approach? The designer may have been
thinking of the elaborate ways tramps wrapped themselves in
newspapers to keep warm. But he didn't just choose a French
newspaper to be printed on those couture silks or a quaintly
historic one; he used The International Herald Tribune, recognized
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to think more globally,'' Galliano said Thursday.
``It's not just about dressing Madame So-and So in France.'' He
added, ``I am thinking the West Coast.'' Already, dresses from the
collection have been dispatched to Los Angeles for the Golden Globe
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hint of the American West, too, at the Yves Saint
Laurent show on Wednesday, although from an unlikely source. Pierre
Berge, who presided over Saint Laurent for nearly 40 years before
everything but the company's couture operation was sold to Gucci
last year, thought he'd have a little fun with Tom Ford, Gucci's
creative director, who was seated in the second row. Among the
songs Berge chose was that poky-cowboy ballad, ``Don't Fence Me
In,'' a reference to Ford's Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the usual Zizi Jeanmaire,'' said Susan Gutfreund, a
client. For sure, but who exactly is being fenced in? As Ford and
Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, watched a vintage Saint
Laurent show of safari suits and lacy evening clothes, French and
American editors watched them. The speculation now in the fashion
industry is all about what Gucci will do with the Saint Laurent
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ford and De Sole went backstage to greet Saint
Laurent. They were immediately engulfed by photographers, and they
left right after the photo op. Saint Laurent said he thought Ford,
whom he has met on a couple of occasions, was ``dynamic, and I love
that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   As Saint Laurent kissed friends, one of his oldest, Paloma
Picasso, watched from the fringe. ``What happens out there,'' she
said, meaning both in fashion and the talk about Gucci's plans,
``is totally peripheral, and actually Yves doesn't get at all that
involved, and he doesn't really care. He's in his own world.''
</P>
<P>
   So haute couture is changing, and in ways the old guard doesn't
completely fathom. ``It's a new day,'' said Mouna Ayoub, couture's
most ardent fan and spender, before de la Renta's Balmain show. Ms.
Ayoub said she especially liked Saint Laurent and Jean Paul
Gaultier and would order three Dior dresses, including a Herald
Trib gown and another based on Egon Schiele's illustrations, which
she plans to wear to the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like Chanel at all,'' she said with a tiny frown. ``I
call it the lampshade collection.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Balmain show was not exactly riveting, and de la Renta ought
to have done more to show off the handwork of the house. This is
couture, after all. In another sense, though, he was very smart.
There has been a conspicuous dearth of day clothes, the sort of
sleek suits and dresses that American women, above all, wear for
comfort and style, and he had them in lightweight tweeds and taupe
linen, sometimes with yellow-tinted python discreetly etched inside
the collars and cuffs. Python also made a play in a snappy white
trench coat and a short pearly beige coat for evening over a draped
navy jersey dress.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there were de la Renta's favorite Moroccan references _
an embroidered caftan-style blouse in creamy beige linen, with a
pleated skirt in a warmer shade of brown, and then the same look in
a hot mix of turquoise and chartreuse. Evening was a variation on
simple garden prints in orange and lilac on white gazar, with
touches of gold-embroidered ingenue tulle and an entrance-making
``knock over the ashtrays, set the house afire'' ball skirt or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Saint Laurent show was all cool tailoring, smooth hair, red
lips _ the essence of what was and, one supposes, remains French
chic. Saint Laurent pursued a romantic Sahara theme, which meant
his classic belted jackets with four pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Things finally came alive when Alek Wek sashayed out in a red
blouse knotted at the midriff and a skirt swinging with black
fringe and twinkling with gold coins around the waist. There was
harem lace and a perversely sexy tuxedo with a frilled white shirt
that conjured up all kinds of thoughts, which Saint Laurent was
good at. Then the murmurs abated, like a rush of sparrows settling
on a tree, and the show proceeded through cabbage-rose prints and
embroidered black lace to the end.
</P>
<P>
   To watch Christian Lacroix's brilliant show on Tuesday was to
have the sense that these were the kinds of modern couture clothes
he should have created 10 years ago, and might have wanted to if
his own past, his successes and failures, hadn't been in the way.
Here was a turquoise chiffon gown draped and pinched randomly in
the front, so that it almost looked destroyed, and another in white
organza with graffiti slashes in red and black.
</P>
<P>
   Not incidentally, these are also the kinds of dresses that
Galliano should have done as the natural, mature follow-up to his
bias slips, if he was of a mind.
</P>
<P>
   The embellishments, the colors were quintessentially Lacroix,
but now they were worked out on simple columns. Yarn and ribbon
embroidery splashed around the hem of a dress in a crazy chorus,
while on top insets of brocade and green lame calmly met a panel of
white. Along with abstract patterns and textures, there was a sense
of things being tossed off _ an orange blouse and skirt in papery
gingham with a strip of silvery embellishment at the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Mouna Ayoub's displeasure with Chanel. When fashion
is spinning in circles, there is no more reliable compass than Karl
Lagerfeld. Although his collection for Chanel on Tuesday evoked
some of Balenciaga's ideas _ the tight tops, the full skirts, the
Spanish love of harmony _ it had none of Balenciaga's absolute
submission to elegance. The clothes were all light, made airborne
by small shoulders and simple petticoats.
</P>
<P>
   Up a spiraling ramp, the models walked with their hands poked
into the pockets of wool suits in shades of lavender, petal green
and spicy orange. Tiny silver beading outlined the seams of a
cobalt suit, its hem just below the knees. Cuffs folded back.
Overlapping squares of white taffeta, cut to resemble feathers,
fluttered on a full skirt.
</P>
<P>
   In his studio a couple of days earlier, Lagerfeld had joked that
the models' hairpieces looked like that most French of breakfast
treats, pain aux raisins.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, the tightly coiled buns had sprung open like
English roses.

   WACO, Texas _ On a typical morning in anytown U.S.A, men and
women flip on the coffee maker before hitting the shower in the
morning. College students stop at the vending machine to buy a soda
on the way to class. Commuters sip steamy tea while they wait in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine is as much a part of millions of Americans' routines as
bathing or getting dressed. Many people recognize the extra
``boost'' it gives them, and some claim they can't start a good day
without it.
</P>
<P>
   But most drowsy drivers and sleepy students probably don't think
about the health benefits, or consequences, caffeine has on their
bodies, said Glenn Pack, director of counseling services for the
Baylor University Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that most people don't consider caffeine a
drug,'' he said. ``It's so accepted and ubiquitous in our society,
that we just don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine is one of the most researched drugs in the medical
world, yet one of the most confusing to the public. One study says
it's addictive, another says it's not. One report says it raises
metabolism, another says is lowers hydration. It's the new drug of
choice for children, then it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, jittery javaholics and cola connoisseurs are making
caffeine an $18 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   All the hype over the world's most popular stimulant is enough
to make even a nonuser hyper.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line about caffeine's health effects is that its
users probably have to take the good with the bad, Pack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enjoyable drug to use, and it does have some benefits
in terms of enhancing performance,'' he said, ``but doing too much
can cause problems. It's a relatively benign drug, in that it takes
large doses to have large side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine is a natural substance found in leaves, seeds or fruits
of more than 63 different plants around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recognized caffeine as
a generally safe drug since 1958. The American Cancer Society's
Guidelines on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer indicate that caffeine
poses no risk for cancer, and other studies show there is little
connection between moderate caffeine intake and heart disease or
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research has shown caffeine to be more beneficial than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   A study published by the International Journal of Sports
Medicine in August 1999 found that attention, psychomotor skills
and long-term memory all improved during the few hours after
volunteers drank caffeinated beverages. That's good news for
students who pop caffeine pills before a night of cramming for
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of caffeine was discovered last summer when the
San Francisco Headache Clinic reported that it increases the
effectiveness of analgesics like aspirin and acetaminophen by up to
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It also temporarily raises metabolism, which some dieters take
into account, said Johnny Sheakley, manager of Gold's Gym in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caffeine is good for you if taken in moderation because it
will increase metabolism to a degree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking caffeine before exercising may, in a roundabout way,
decrease body fat, he said. So drinking a diet cola or a cup of
coffee before a work-out may boost energy levels and enhance
performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before anyone thinks caffeine should be a new food group,
experts warn that too much caffeine can still have adverse effects
on just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence reports
that in extreme cases, caffeine can cause seizures, convulsions and
psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. Continued
use can disrupt sleep patterns, hinder academic performance and
lead to bone disease from poor absorption of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much? Like most things, it depends on the
individual, Pack said. Studies have shown that most adults consume
about 200 milligrams of caffeine each day, which Pack said is a
healthy amount. But many people become ``addicted'' to caffeine if
they have 5 or 6 cups of coffee a day, he said. The jury is still
out on whether caffeine addicts can experience actual withdrawal
symptoms, but Pack said some definitely feel anxiety and depression
when they ween themselves off caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   If the potential dangers of caffeine make anyone want to quit
percolating coffee in the morning, a good night's sleep may have
the same effect as a cup of coffee in the morning, Pack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, people tend to be chronically sleep deprived
and use caffeine as a compensatory device,'' he said. ``Getting
sleep at night is a way to (feel alert) without using caffeine.''

   NY-HAMPTONS (New York) _ As the economy has thrived, the
Hamptons have changed over the past decade. With day-trippers, rap
star entourages and traffic jams now as much a part of the summer
scene as fresh corn and cloudless afternoons on the beach, many
homeowners can find peace only when the season ends. And so, over
the past few years, the East End has come alive in the winter with
Manhattan refugees looking for a getaway, albeit one dusted with
frost. By Nancy Hass. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-FASHION (Paris) _ On Wednesday, at a dinner at the
American Embassy given by Ambassador Felix Rohatyn and his wife,
Elizabeth, for Oscar de la Renta, the main topic was John
Galliano's show for Christian Dior. Drawn from a nether world of
tramps and mental patients, the show, which had models draped
eccentrically in newsprint-patterned silk and straitjackets, has
been a subject of debate all week in the French media, with many
pundits condemning it as insensitive. Galliano may have been
thinking of the elaborate ways tramps wrapped themselves in
newspapers to keep warm. But he didn't just choose a French
newspaper to be printed on those couture silks or a quaintly
historic one; he used The International Herald Tribune, recognized
around the world. By Cathy Horyn. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAMA-GENA-COURSES (New York) _ Mrs. Regena Thomashauer and her
husband, Bruce, have run Relationship Technologies in Manhattan
since 1993. They offer a variety of courses that coach men and
women, individually and in groups, on how to feel good about
themselves and get what they want _ which usually means a better
job and better sex. The Thomashauers use everything from film clips
to encounter group jargon to snack breaks with home-baked cookies
to get emotionally clammed-up New Yorkers to demystify both their
bosses and their orgasms. The Mama Gena course teaches women to
``access their power and use it for pleasure,'' as Mrs. Thomashauer
says. By Alex Witchel. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   PINKIE-RINGS (Undated) _ Lately, high fashion has rehabilitated
once-declasse items, from ruffled tuxedo shirts to tube tops. But
it has ignored the pinkie ring. ``Generally, a pinkie ring has a
touch of vulgarity,'' said John Fairchild, the former chairman of
Women's Wear Daily and an arbiter of all things chic. Long
dismissed as a symbol of bad taste, the pinkie ring, with its
associations to cheese balls and Joe Pesci, seemed too felonious to
overlook. Like celebrating a bad toupee. Which is all right with
me. If loving pinkie rings is a crime, then I'm happy to plead
guilty. By Ilene Rosenzweig. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   NITEOUT-ZAGATS (New York) _ For the second time in the last
three years, the publishers of the Zagat restaurant survey invited
their ``wittiest contributors'' to dinner. These 10 were selected
for their skill at compressing a two-hour dinner into a pithy
haiku-like review. Le Bernardin, the top-rated spot in the 2000
guide, is described as ``piscatory perfection'' and ``expensive.''
The assembled wags included three lawyers, a couple of writers, an
accountant at MTV, an 86-year-old opera singer, a marketing
manager, a recent New York University MBA, and a policeman from
Staten Island. Tim and Nina Zagat presided. By Rick Marin. &QL;

<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A virus, called plum pox, is
widespread in Europe and has been identified in India, northern
Africa and Chile. But it was unknown in North America until last
October, when it was identified in several orchards in Adams
County, in south-central Pennsylvania, one of the state's main
fruit-growing regions. The virus affects stone-fruit trees,
including peaches, plums and apricots. It drastically reduces
yield, and the foliage and fruit of an infected tree are covered
with unsightly lesions. The disease also affects ornamentals like
flowering plums and weeping peaches as well as fruit-producing
trees. There's no cure, and the only way to control the disease is
to destroy trees that carry the virus. By Cass Peterson. &QL;

`BRUTALLY NORMAL' JUST A LOT OF HORNY BANALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Jan. 24, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BRUTALLY NORMAL 
Starring: Mike Damus, Lea Moreno, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tangle
Ambrose, Joanna Pacula 
On: WB 
Time: Back to back episodes, Monday at 9 and 9:30. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse me. (I just yawned.) It must be the prospect of yet
another comedy about a clique of media-savvy, sex-obsessed high
schoolers, starring offbeat but attractive teen actors with
breakout potential.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are certainly against the WB series ``Brutally
Normal,'' the newest addition to a prime time already overstuffed
with shows in the area we call the baggy-pants zone. I guess that,
as the self-appointed home of young consumers prowling for clues to
their next accoutrement, the WB is doomed to keep churning out the
demographically driven series, quality (``Popular'') or no quality
(``Dawson's Creek'').
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Brutally Normal'' is somewhere in the middle of the
quality spectrum. It is the WB's answer to the hit teen movie
``American Pie,'' substituting two boys and two girls for the
movie's four boys, and avoiding the movie's explicit gross-out
humor and ``Portnoy's Complaint'' moments. It stars Eddie Kaye
Thomas, who played the guy who slept with his friend's mom in
``American Pie,'' and it is similarly preoccupied with virginity,
computer tricks, and those wacky adults. The sitcom premieres on WB
with two back-to-back episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its resemblance to so many other shows, the problem
with ``Brutally Normal'' is its attraction to teen genre cliches.
In the first episode, for example, Thomas' Russell is at the center
of a very tired Mrs. Robinson plot that has him going after the
substitute teacher. Is there a youth series that hasn't already
been here and done this? It doesn't help to tack on a surrealistic
fantasy that references ``The Graduate''; stale is stale.
</P>
<P>
   But then the 9:30 episode shows promise, as it throws Russell
into some clever business about a student uprising that lasts as
long as an MTV video _ but long enough for the student media to
interrupt programming with ``Crisis at Normall High.'' Let's hope
``Brutally Normal'' continues to set its sights on this kind of
friendly irreverence, and steers clear of horny banality.

SPENDING ON Y2K PUT HIRING ON HOLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Companies spent so much time and money fixing their
Y2K problems last year that they put off spending money on
e-commerce, developing Web sites and other information technology
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the computer kinks brought on by the dawning of the
new century are largely behind us, companies will probably free up
those millions of dollars to get up-to-date on the latest and
greatest technology to boost their productivity and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   And that means more jobs for information technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to non-Y2K projects should probably happen in the next
couple of months as the Y2K glitches are worked out, said Tony
Pannagl, managing partner of IS&AMP;T Staffing Group in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pannagl said requests for employees during the past three to
four months have been slow, but the pace should soon quicken.
</P>
<P>
   PanCanadian Energy Services, for example, already has begun the
process of shifting gears. While the energy trading company in
Houston didn't have to spend a lot on Y2K efforts _ only about
$25,000 because so many of its systems were already Y2K compatible
_ it can spend that money on projects that will improve the
company's productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the money PanCanadian Energy plans to spend will go to
beef up its infrastructure so the details of commodity trades _
such as price, quantity and location _ are easily accessible to
in-house traders, said Richard Zamora, manager of application
development. The new system will make it easier to keep track of
the company's current positions and should result in faster trades.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said some of the Y2K money also will go toward improving
the way offices can keep track of their customers and their needs.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to hire new employees to work on those projects.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EARNING A PAYCHECK ELSEWHERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new year couldn't come fast enough for Dennis Robinson. The
systems integration specialist said he hasn't worked much since
April because of all the spending on Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   That's when companies seemed to stop spending money on non-Y2K
projects, said Robinson, whose expertise is in electronic data
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who lives in Houston, said he had been working
steadily for a transportation company in Portland, Ore., but he and
other contract employees were terminated because the company needed
to reallocate its information technology funds to fix its Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Robinson got a real estate sales license in
August and a loan officer license in November.
</P>
<P>
   While he has had some success as a real estate agent, Robinson
hopes the job market will loosen up in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While folks such as Robinson are happy that Y2K problems seem to
be a thing of the past, there has been some concern that Y2K
experts, who are often programmers who know the old computer
languages, will be out of work.
</P>
<P>
   But that shouldn't happen, said Pannagl. People with Y2K skill
sets will be easily absorbed because they're so much in demand.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who are comfortable with computers and with
learning new programs, said John Challenger, chief executive
officer of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement firm in
Chicago. It's not as if they're incapable of learning new programs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
350,000 COMPUTER JOBS AVAILABLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas estimated 100,000 Y2K computer
specialists have entered the job market this month as their Y2K
work ends.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing bidding war is emerging for those Y2K employees.
In that battle for talent, signing bonuses and salaries will
escalate, Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of companies needing the best employees so they
can get a good position in the fiercely competitive global economy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the influx of new employees won't offer much in the way of
relief to the computer industry, which needs to fill about 350,000
job openings, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abundance of good-paying jobs, the number of college
students who are selecting high-tech majors is falling.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas referred to a study by the American
Electronics Association that found the number of degrees awarded in
engineering, math, physics and computer science dipped 5 percent
between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the association, that trend appears to be
continuing.

HOUSTON DOCTORS TAKE ISSUE WITH PLAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In ``Wit,'' the patient, not her doctor, is the hero.
The tough, uncompromising poetry scholar is dying of ovarian
cancer. She finds herself in the harsh theater of a teaching
hospital, at the mercy of physicians who see her as nothing more
than data for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The story is profoundly moving, but how close is it to the
reality of cancer treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Five cancer doctors who attended the Houston performance, which
opened earlier this week at the Alley Theatre, say they empathized
with the patient, professor Vivian Bearing, and identified with the
pitfalls of their profession _ but they took issue with the
playwright's unflattering portrayal of physicians and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient was familiar to me in many ways. I do high-dose
chemotherapy for patients with ovarian cancer. Many of the people
who come to me are highly educated, strong-willed, that are put in
this position of feeling like they're relinquishing power and
control,'' said Dr. Michelle Donato, bone-marrow transplant
specialist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the play reflect how patients feel? It probably does.
Does it reflect medical reality? It probably does not. That's what
made me wince.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Edson's play won the Pulitzer Prize in 1999. The
doctors were invited to the play by the Houston Chronicle and asked
to discuss their reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Gershenson, chairman of gynecologic oncology at M.D.
Anderson, found the play ``a little disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was a caricature of reality for what we see at M.D.
Anderson. I think they were trying to portray the attending
physician as pretty insensitive, focused on research and not the
patient herself,'' he said. ``The fellow was sort of a bumbling
idiot who had no bedside manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life doctors also found flaws with the play's portrayal
of aggressive chemotherapy, which they say has come a long way from
the grueling experience depicted in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Chang, a Baylor College of Medicine oncologist
specializing in breast cancer, pointed out that new cancer drugs
are better tolerated by the body, with fewer side effects.
Patient-controlled pain medication is readily available, as are
drugs to control nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel bad about is people leaving (the play) will have
all these misconceptions of cancer and cancer therapy, which I
don't think is a good thing,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patients are up, showered, makeup on, dressed, every single
day, and they walk the hallways, and they are committed to their
treatment,'' added Donato. ``They're not in bed vomiting. It's not
as scary as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the script provided food for thought for doctors
in cutting-edge medicine, who must balance science and the thirst
for new discoveries with sensitivity and patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time. If you're telling someone they have a
new diagnosis of cancer, you can't just spend 10 minutes, hand on
the doorknob, and leave the room,'' said Dr. Roy Herbst, a
researcher and specialist in cancers of the head, neck and lungs at
M.D. Anderson. He no longer answers patient questions through
e-mail because of the potential for sounding insensitive or
impersonal. ``You have to make sure they realize you care. ... So
they don't feel like a (laboratory) mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to learn how to break bad news,'' Gershenson said.
``It doesn't come naturally. One of the hardest questions is,
`What's my prognosis and how much longer do I have to live?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of M.D. Anderson, said the lesson
doctors learn from their teachers and through experience is that
every patient wants a different answer to that question. The
physician's job, he said, is to figure out what the patient wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want hope. That's a uniform thing,'' he said. ``Some
people want to know `72 percent are cured and the average life span
of those who aren't cured is 13 1/2 months.' Some people don't want
to hear those kinds of numbers. They want to know we've seen people
cured with this approach. That's enough for that patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato said, ``It's hard to be honest, but the patients do
appreciate it. Most of them want to know what you know. Doesn't
make it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbst said, ``People are always very angry with the first
doctor they've seen. `I don't want to go back to him. He said I was
going to die.' Maybe it came across that way because it was the
first time. It's an evolving process. People have to come to grips
with their diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their criticism of the play's depiction of modern
medicine, the doctors said the performance prompted
self-examination. Gershenson said, ``I think any physician watching
that play would really reflect on, am I like that? I think all of
us at one time or another see that, because medicine is a microcosm
of society and we have insensitive people and we have caring
people. For sure, I looked for myself in all those characters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This play was good for doctors, I think,'' Donato added.
``Maybe when I (go on rounds) tomorrow, I'll make sure I was not
like any of the doctors I saw in the play. I may take a little bit
more time. It's a reality check. I may take a few extra moments
tomorrow.''

`DOWN TO YOU': EVEN BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE GET THE BLUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Extremely good-looking people tend to be shallow,
self-involved and not very bright. Let's call this statement what
it is: a form of prejudice, a stereotype. It is, sadly, a
stereotype that ``Down to You'' does everything in its power to
promote. The film's stars, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles, are
wonderful to look at: their dimples match beautifully, their bodies
move with effortless grace, their teeth are downright inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   One of them _ Ms. Stiles, for what it's worth _ may even have
the ability to act. But she is forced by the script to say things
like ``have to endorphinize'' and ``cake is my world,'' so how
could we tell?
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Prinze, with his charming, lopsided smile,
cheerfully impersonates a young man who feels that his relationship
is beginning to fray because his girlfriend insists on opening her
eyes when they kiss, and because when he beats her at Ping-Pong she
refuses to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Imogen and Al.
</P>
<P>
   They are, needless to say, college students, attending a fine
old university somewhere in Central Park. They have the usual array
of problems, which is to say, none at all. Al majors in something
called ``liberal arts'' _ we glimpse him, now and then, doing a
convincing impression of a person reading a book _ but his true
passion is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sacred,'' he tells Imogen when, in the early days of
their courtship, he brings her a cake. (Guess what? Cake is her
world! Talk about coincidence.)
</P>
<P>
   Al's father is a celebrity chef (Henry Winkler) who dreams of a
father-son cooking show based on ``Cops.'' Imogen has her own
dreams and passions: she's an artist. This means she can look at an
abstract canvas and explain to her mystified beau that it is, in
fact, ``impressionistic'' because ``the brush technique really says
something about the ambience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it does. The ambience of ``Down to You'' _ perhaps
Imogen knows the significance of the title _ is scrubbed, wholesome
and bland. Yes, there is a subplot involving Al's friend Monk (Zak
Orth), who parlays an appearance in a pornographic movie called
``Ben Huge'' into a career as a highbrow smut auteur with a loft
and an Orson Welles accent.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Al is pursued by a predatory pornography actress named
Cyrus (Selma Blair), who used to study chemistry at MIT. Yes, Al
and Imogen do have a lot of sex; they're college students, after
all. But the film _ which includes, by my count, exactly two
obscenities, and a few interesting new euphemisms (did you know
that ``hothouse'' was a verb?) _ is far less candid, and less
graphic, then an average episode of ``Popular'' or ``Dawson's
Creek.'' It's also much less interesting, and less competently
made. Kris Isacsson, who wrote and directed, seems aware that a
feature film requires narrative complication _ not even really
good-looking people can be happy all the time. But he flees from
anything that might involve real human emotion, or for that matter
any credible human activity other than looking good.
</P>
<P>
   The script does require Al to sink, briefly, into despair, which
Prinze registers with a charming, lopsided pout. Ms. Stiles is
actually called upon to cry. But this is a romantic comedy, so
everything turns out fine, and there are scenes that will move you
to uncontrollable laughter. But not intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down to You'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes sexual situations and nipple-piercing.

TEEN FLICK NEEDS MORE THAN HOLLYWOOD NAMES TO FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
DOWN TO YOU 
Directed and written by: Kris  Isacsson 
Starring: Freddie Prinzecq, Jr., Julia Stilescq, Selma Blair  and
Shawn Hatosy 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rating: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young Hollywood's hottest names aren't enough to save the latest
teen flick ``Down To You.'' This romantic comedy about first love
boasts appearances by alumni of some of the most popular young
adult movies: Freddie Prinze, Jr. (``She's All That'' and ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer), Julia Stiles (``Ten Things I Hate About
You'') and Selma Blair (``Cruel Intentions'').
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the acting never gets muscular enough to make the
audience care about what happens to the two lovers played by Prinze
and Stiles. Then again, the teens who are likely to see this film
probably aren't expecting ``The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is a step up from the surfeit of teen dramas that came
out last year. This time, the action takes place on a college
campus - the outdoor scenes were shot in and around Columbia
University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Imogen (Stiles) and Al (Prinze) exude a great deal of charm as
they meet and quickly fall in love. ``Down To You'' deals with the
what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter and director Kris Isacsson attempts to beef up the
story by dealing with issues like faithfulness, distance and
boredom, that come up in long term affairs. In that way, this isn't
your typical teen film.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, there's no there there. The film seems to drag
on as it deals with side issues like Al's desire to become a chef
and Imogen's goal to make a career out of her drawing abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the film is too cute. All too often, Al
and Imogen address the camera to explain what they were thinking as
their relationship develops. And although this is a comedy, the
belly laughs are MIA. The best skit features Henry Winkler, who
plays Al's father, the host of a cooking television show. In the
film, Winkler's character envisions a father/son cooking show
called ``Cooks!'' where they would enter homes like a SWAT team and
make a meal (think of it as a ``Cops!'' with food).
</P>
<P>
   Although their acting seems strained in some places and
overworked in others, Prinze and Stiles exude a lot of charm.
Prinze in particular earns his paycheck. His long lashes and lush
lips are enough to convince any teenage girl to depart with a few
dollars to see the film.
</P>
<P>
   The friends that surround them, however, are quirky in a way
that only happens in movies. There's the rich friend (Zak Orth) who
makes films and throws hedonistic parties. And Al's roommate (Shawn
Hatosy) is so desperate for a girlfriend, he picks up a girl who's
having a fight with her boyfriend in a nightclub.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I've been wearing it for 30 years,'' Tony Sirico
said. ``It's part of my life.'' Sirico was discussing his pinkie
ring, the same one he wears when playing Paulie Walnuts on ``The
Sopranos,'' the HBO mob opera that started its second season last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Mafia wear pinkie rings, but men of style wear pinkie
rings,'' Sirico said. ``So long as they're not gaudy and the man
has a nice hand _ not too feminine a hand.'' Sirico, who favors
what he called a ``sexy'' black onyx look, said he was unaware that
pinkie rings had gone out of style.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. They aren't anymore. Out of style, that is. Rapt
``Sopranos'' fans revel in the show's anti-``Godfather'' suburban
New Jersey ambience: the women with their acrylic nails and bad
aerobics outfits, the leather- and marble-appointed living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But far from mocking this tackiness, the show, and its
authentic-seeming wise guys, like Paulie Walnuts, have rendered it
cool, pinkie rings and all.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the classiness spectrum, pinkie rings play a
pivotal part in the film ``The Talented Ripley,'' as tokens of the
high-born lineage to which Matt Damon's Tom Ripley so desperately
aspires.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, high fashion has rehabilitated once-declasse items, from
ruffled tuxedo shirts to tube tops. But it has ignored the pinkie
ring. ``Generally, a pinkie ring has a touch of vulgarity,'' said
John Fairchild, the former chairman of Women's Wear Daily and an
arbiter of all things chic.
</P>
<P>
   Long dismissed as a symbol of bad taste, the pinkie ring, with
its associations to cheese balls and Joe Pesci, seemed too
felonious to overlook. Like celebrating a bad toupee.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all right with me. If loving pinkie rings is a crime,
then I'm happy to plead guilty. Maybe because I grew up on Long
Island at a time when boys picked you up for the prom wearing
tuxedos and sneakers, I've always yearned for the opposite: guys
with polish and panache, a kind of macho dandy.
</P>
<P>
   You can smell him coming, an intoxicating cocktail of fresh
shirt, cologne and a hair shine _ confident enough in his
masculinity to indulge his feminine side.
</P>
<P>
   Sirico spoke by telephone, during an afternoon of watching the
horses on television and ``making sauce'' in his Brooklyn
apartment, where he lives with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The pinkie ring expresses a masculine elegance that transcends
race, creed and culture. The Duke of Windsor wore one, and Prince
Charles does. Signet rings, as aristocrats know, were originally
used to stamp initials or family crests into sealing wax, and worn
on the pinkie, an easy finger to extend.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop princes like Sean Combs have also adopted them. The
rapper Jay-Z posed for an album cover with his Bentley and a
diamond-encrusted pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conscious or unconscious, ironic or unironic, they're trying
to impersonate a member of WASP society, impersonating British
upper class,'' said Toby Young, an English writer living in New
York, whose pinkie bears his family crest, a moorhen.
</P>
<P>
   Old-time-comedy royalty favored them, too. The televised Dean
Martin roasts of the 1970s, tapes of which are now sold through
infomercials, were a pinkie ring bonanza. From George Burns to
Milton Berle, Jack Benny to Jackie Gleason, Bob Newhart to Bob
Hope, these legends fired off zingers with pinkies flashing.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Alan King, the Friar Club member and longtime
roaster, he said, ``Well, we were all a bunch of wise guys.'' Back
in the pinkie heyday, he recalled, the cat's-eye and star sapphires
were the hip stones to get. ``Everyone looked to see the best star
_ who had the best one,'' he said. ``It was very affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra wore a signet ring with a family crest on his
right hand, dressing up an otherwise inelegant mitt. ``My knuckles
are like broken bananas,'' he once said. He refused the gift of an
ID bracelet from his family, saying he wore only the ring, and
besides, ``I know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To me, the pinkie ring conveys that kind of bravado. Which is
why I think it's an injustice that women don't wear them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Women need pinkie rings. Fendi baguettes and pashmina scarves
can hardly be talismans of inner strength when their trendiness is
so fleeting. High heels are a more consistent power statement, but
they hurt too much.
</P>
<P>
   What object of style can offer unquestionable self-assurance
that won't be gone next season? Maybe a diamond engagement ring,
the only flaw being that it is given by a man. A pinkie ring, on
the other hand, can be inherited, a coming-of-age hand-me-down. It
can also be bought with your own earnings, say, after a good day at
the track.
</P>
<P>
   To put my money where my pinkie is, I visited Bobby Satin, a
jeweler in Chinatown. Satin has been in the business for 40 years,
long enough to have seen the pinkie's fortunes come and go. In the
1950s and '60s, the rings were big, he told me, pulling out a tray
of vintage ones: understated sapphires, gold horse heads set in
diamond horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkie rings are often thought to bring luck, and they are
rubbed and turned by some gamblers like worry beads. Almost
sheepishly, Satin conceded that he used to wear one himself, gold
with green jade _ a good luck stone in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   He took his off 20 years ago, around the time he had one made
for his son, who was college-bound. His son gave it back, saying
he'd never wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Why did they go out of style? Hippies. Grunge. Long hair became
the new expression of sensitized masculinity. On ``The Sopranos,''
Christopher, Tony Soprano's hot-headed nephew, from the next
generation, does not wear a pinkie ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebellion, I guess,'' Michael Imperioli, who plays
Christopher, said at the premiere party last week at Roseland
Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkie rings have always been about impersonating style heroes,
from well-to-do Americans emulating British aristocrats to working
stiffs _ gangsters, car dealers, show biz characters _ striving
toward a life of leisure. Inherently tacky, it is still a
fundamental of American style: self-invention.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these days, when wearing rings in your navels and eyebrows
is common, the most rebellious thing a girl can do is to stake a
claim to a pinkie ring, joining those few fabulous female pinkie
wearers like Lil' Kim and Angie Dickenson, aka ``Police Woman,''
who was sensational on a Dean Martin roast in a strapless spangled
gown and an arsenal of diamonds on her left pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   So I picked out a gold pinkie ring with a diamond-chip horseshoe
for good luck, like the one Big Pussy Bompensero wears on ``The
Sopranos.'' You're supposed to wear it facing up, with the ends of
the horseshoe pointing to the nail, so that the luck won't run out.
(So said Joe Mantegna, playing a snazzy numbers runner in Barry
Levinson's film ``Liberty Heights.'')
</P>
<P>
   The ring's previous owner had a pinkie twice as big as mine, so
Satin sized it down. Suddenly feeling large, I bought another one,
for my best pallie, just like the friendship pinkie rings Frank
once bought for himself and Dean.
</P>
<P>
   On second look, I started to worry that there was a pinkie love
handle poking over the edge of the band. In the ring, my finger
looked fat. I didn't think I could pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Satin shook his head, assuring me that it was swollen only from
trying rings on and suggesting I switch hands. I did and then
remembered something said to me at the Soprano's premiere party by
Chuck Zito, who plays a Mafia gangster on HBO's prison drama,
``Oz.'' ``The bigger and hairier the hand, the better it looks,''
said Zito, whose pinkie ring is a diamond-studded boxing glove from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   So my pinkie's slightly pudgy. You got a problem with that? &QL;

102-YEAR-OLD TEXAS AUTHOR LEARNED TO READ ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ ``A wise man can change,'' George Dawson says in a low,
halting voice, ``but a fool stays the same. I didn't want to be the
fool.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, is what motivated him to go back to school four
years ago and learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson celebrated his 102nd birthday Tuesday, but the party at
Lincoln Instructional Center in Dallas was not just a toast to his
longevity, but to his literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he couldn't read the label on a cereal box and
now he is not just a reader, but an author. On Feb. 2, his book,
``Life Is So Good,'' will arrive in bookstores, and the publisher,
Random House, was confident enough to order a first printing of
100,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Co-authored by Seattle elementary school teacher Richard
Glaubman, the book scans the 20th century through the eyes of an
illiterate laborer. Dawson is a grandson of slaves who was 10 when
he witnessed a lynching in downtown Marshall; Texas, the father of
seven children he drove to excel in school while concealing from
them his own inability to read; a raconteur who held his stories in
memory for 100 years awaiting the day he could write them down.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's father put him to work when he was 8 and hired him out
as a day laborer at 12. In his lifetime, he drove railroad spikes
in East Texas, stoked the fires of sawmills, toiled in the dairy
industry all the while watching the decades pass from a
``different'' vantage point, his co-author says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembers across the span of the 20th century,'' Glaubman
says, ``but he remembers a version that is different from any other
that has been recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman first heard of Dawson four years ago. After reading a
story in the Seattle Times about a 98-year-old man going back to
school, he clipped the article to share with his fifth-grade class.
Then he came to Dallas for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there might be a good children's book in this ... a
small book on literacy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also thought he might encounter on old man full of bitterness
for the hard hand life had dealt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had experienced a life of hardship, but all I could hear
from him was gratitude and pleasure,'' Glaubman says. ``It was a
humbling experience to see a man so happy and at peace with
himself, a man who expected so little and had so little in material
things.''
</P>
<P>
   They talked for a long time on that first visit, and the stories
tumbled out of the old man, who had just begun to learn the
alphabet and rudimentary phonics. Soon, Glaubman was spending his
vacations and holidays on regular trips to Dallas, paying for them
out of his savings.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed with Dawson in his small, boxlike house with sagging
ceilings and cracked windows in South Dallas. He ate the soul food
Dawson dished up, rented cars and drove the old man around town.
But mostly he listened to the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a dream that I would learn how to read,'' Dawson
told him. ``It was my secret that I couldn't read. My mind worked
hard. When I traveled somewhere, I could never read a sign. I had
to ask people things and had to remember. I could never let my mind
forget anything, never let my mind take a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   When his children entered school, he sat with them at the dining
table each evening and helped them with their homework. They never
suspected that he couldn't read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to show him our homework when we were done,'' says
Dawson's son, George Jr. ``He would say, `Read back what you've
got. You'll learn better that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   As his children reached high school, Dawson let them in on his
secret, and it was one they helped him keep, although in those days
illiteracy was not uncommon among the men and women of their
father's generation.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dawson says, he simply believed his time had
passed, the opportunity for such a basic education lost to him
forever. But at the age of 98, he still longed to read, especially
the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could do it,'' he says. ``I always figured I could do
anything anybody else could do. I just didn't have a chance to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a young man walked Dawson's neighborhood
knocking on doors to spread the word about adult education classes
at the nearby Lincoln Instructional Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there were some classes for adults,'' Dawson says.
``They taught reading. I had never heard of those classes. The
school was the same one my children had gone to and it was close
enough to walk to. I told him I was tired of fishing; it's time to
learn to read.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, 1996, he walked into a classroom for the first time.
His teacher was Carl Henry, who had worked for the school system
for 33 years, retired and then came back to fill in for a young
teacher who had taken another job.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked Dawson if he knew the alphabet, Dawson replied,
``No, son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With him around, I didn't feel so old anymore,'' Henry laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson turned out to be one of his most devoted students. He
learned the alphabet in a day and a half, Henry says, and quickly
became impatient with the slow pace of phonics, the breaking of
words into small parts and sounding them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited too long, son,'' Dawson told him early on. ``Show
me some words that make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a magnet,'' Henry says. ``He draws people to this
class. They want to be around him and learn from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Dawson's progress over a two-year period, Glaubman
realized his story went beyond the bounds of a motivational tale
for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has vitality and health and a passion for what he's
doing,'' Glaubman says.
</P>
<P>
   That passion is reflected in the book they have written and the
unusually large printing suggests that the publishers anticipate
that Dawson's story will have broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just hoping to make enough money to fix his roof and
pay some of my bills,'' Glaubman says. At Dawson's birthday party,
Glaubman presented his co-author with an advance copy of the book,
which may do far more than fix the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had plans to write another, Dawson shrugged and
said: ``Oh, I don't know. You never know what you're going to do in
life.''

TAIWAN'S CHINA AIRLINES WORKS TO OVERCOME POOR SAFETY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ For China Airlines, the 1990s were a recurring
nightmare: three fiery crashes in six years that resulted in nearly
500 deaths. The only cold comfort for Taiwan's flagship carrier is
that travelers seem to have developed shorter memories.
</P>
<P>
   When a China Airlines' Airbus crashed near Taipei's airport in
February 1998, killing 202 people, it scared away passengers for
months and contributed to the airline's first net loss in 12 years.
But when a China Airlines' MD-11 flipped over and burned after
landing during a typhoon in Hong Kong last August, killing three
people, it depressed the airline's bookings for just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total casualty rate was lower,'' said Sandy K.Y. Liu, the
president of China Airlines, in an interview this week. ``And the
incident occurred during severe weather conditions. So except for
in Taiwan, a lot of people assumed that the weather caused the
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In the airline's home country, Liu acknowledged, many people
immediately assumed that the pilots were to blame. That skepticism
sums up the enormity of the task facing Liu, a 30-year veteran of
China Airlines who is laboring to mend the carrier's reputation.
While Taiwan travelers continue to fly China Airlines, they do so
out of necessity and convenience _ not a sense of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame people for jumping to the conclusion that it
must be China Airlines' fault,'' said Liu, 51. ``Our responsibility
is to bring passengers from A to B and land there safely. We did
not do that in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   China Airlines is not the only Asian carrier with a poor safety
record. Korean Air and Garuda Indonesia both rank near the top of
the list of major carriers involved in fatal crashes. But China
Airlines has some unenviable distinctions: it is the only airline
to have crashed two Airbus A300-600s, and it is the only carrier to
have crashed twice in Hong Kong. In 1993, a China Airlines 747
overshot the runway at the old Kai Tak airport and landed in
Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the problems that plague China Airlines are
typical of Asian companies generally. Founded by retired Taiwan air
force officers in 1959, the airline is controlled by the China
Aviation Development Foundation, a quasi-government organization.
Analysts say those ties bind China Airlines, by preventing Liu from
carrying out a much-needed, top-to-bottom reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who control those shares have connections to the
pilots, so to some extent, the pilots dictate things at the
airline,'' said Jim Eckes, a consultant at Indoswiss Aviation in
Hong Kong. ``As long as the management can't crack the pilot
culture, they can't solve the bigger problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Taipei crash, the government ordered the aviation
foundation to privatize the airline by selling its 71 percent
stake. China Airlines seemed close to that goal early last year
when it entered negotiations to sell an equity stake to Singapore
Airlines. But the talks foundered after the two carriers could not
agree on the size of the stake or on management control.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, China Airlines made another push for the private
sector. It hired Salomon Smith Barney to find a buyer for half the
foundation's stake, or roughly 35 percent of the shares. But a
self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline passed without a deal. Liu declined
to comment on the status of the search, except to say that the
foundation was still determined to sell its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the latest problem is that the airline's shares are
trading well below the foundation's asking price. Liu noted that
one of the foundation's missions was to ``generate a lot of money''
from the privatization, which it plans to use to nurture the
aviation industry in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that China Airlines will benefit from the
delay. In addition to forgetful customers, the waning of the Asian
economic crisis has revived traffic. ``The longer the delay, the
better it is, because their position can only improve,'' said Barry
Grindrod, the publisher of Orient Aviation, a trade publication in
Hong Kong. ``Their financial projections are getting stronger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But that assumes China Airlines will not relive the disasters of
the last decade. Eckes and other experts said China Airlines was
still overly reliant on former air force pilots, whose imperious
style is poorly suited to the more collegial environment of a
commercial airplane cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei accident, as well as a crash in Nagoya, Japan, in
1994 which killed 264 people, were both attributed to pilot error.
China Airlines denies its pilots erred in the last Hong Kong crash,
although the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department said in a report
in November that the wind speeds were above the recommended limits
when the captain, who was Italian, decided to land.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said China Airlines had instituted a rigorous retraining and
recertification program. And he said the airline was recruiting
expatriate pilots, as well as new college graduates, to complement
its air force pilots. Liu said military pilots accounted for only
one-third of the airline's total cockpit staff, although an
internal China Airlines document puts the figure at 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people say, but I don't think my hands are tied,''
Liu said. ``I'm a very hardheaded person, and my only ambition is
to change this company.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everything about relationships is knowable,'' Regena
Thomashauer said, ``but in our society people act as if it's only
up to the fates or a good hair day. The myth about finding a soul
mate keeps people shopping for years and never buying. They keep
passing on good guys because they're not Prince Charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you become soul mates is you pick a guy and expose
more and more of your soul to him over time as he does to you.
You're not dependent on him just appearing in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 14 women at the opening seminar of Mama Gena's
School of Womanly Arts nodded in agreement, while others seemed to
ponder, for the first time, the possibilities of a city filled with
princes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thomashauer and her husband, Bruce, have run Relationship
Technologies since 1993 from their brownstone on the Upper West
Side. They offer a variety of courses that coach men and women,
individually and in groups, on how to feel good about themselves
and get what they want _ which usually means a better job and
better sex. Think of it as the Power of Positive Thinking as
interpreted by Anais Nin.
</P>
<P>
   Their place has become a destination, attracting painters,
actors and fashionistas (though they keep mum on the celebrity
quotient, which is said to be high). The Thomashauers use
everything from film clips to encounter group jargon to snack
breaks with home-baked cookies to get emotionally clammed-up New
Yorkers to demystify both their bosses and their orgasms. The Mama
Gena course teaches women to ``access their power and use it for
pleasure,'' as Mrs. Thomashauer says.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds something like the feminist empowerment we were
hearing about 30 years ago, what's changed is this: Nowadays, it
seems, girls just want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feminist movement was really sourced by anger,'' Mrs.
Thomashauer said. ``The problem with anger, though, is that it
never leads to happiness. We thought that if women could step into
a new dimension of feminism that was a celebration of womanhood,
they would learn how to treasure themselves, which is a more fun
game than being angry or seeking revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasuring yourself is what Mrs. Thomashauer, 43, is teaching as
Mama Gena. She calls it getting in touch with your inner goddess _
and honey, every woman has one. She looks like Ava Gardner, thinks
like Marie Curie and makes Dorothy Parker seem tongue-tied. And
needless to say, she has fabulous sex. How can you argue with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a goddess is the female equivalent of Joseph Campbell's
`Follow your bliss,''' Mrs. Thomashauer said. ``It's realizing that
your desires and appetites should be trusted to get you whatever it
is you want. There's no magic to it except that all of us have
instincts and intuition, and when you pay attention to that, life
gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   The goddess notion is nothing new: Marianne Williamson, the New
Age guru popular in the early 1990s, wrote of a mythical goddess
whose intuition and nurturance were the embodiment of feminine
power. But the Thomashauers are in sync with other feel-better
gurus of the moment who are promoting a goulash of postfeminism,
New Age spirituality and good old ``Our Bodies, Ourselves'' sexual
how-to.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Day, the author of ``Practical Intuition,'' recently gave
a workshop on empowerment at Demi Moore's Idaho home that was
written up in Marie Claire magazine. Among other activities, the
participants burned in effigy objects holding them back from
achieving happiness (Ms. Moore burned a man's necktie). InStyle
magazine reports that the goddess movement is big in Hollywood now,
in an article about a garden party where young actresses donned
tiaras to play a board game called ``Go, Goddess!'' It included
questions like, ``What is the greatest gift your mother has given
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women at this three-hour Mama Gena seminar, which
meets once a week for nine weeks at a cost of $500, ranged in age
from their mid-20s to mid-40s, with two closer to 60. Many were
single, one was married, one was engaged. About half insisted on
anonymity; the other half allowed the use of their first names
only. All first names were preceded by the prefix ``Sister
Goddess.'' I was only glad that my brothers weren't there to hear
me addressed as Sister Goddess Alex.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with a bragging competition. ``Women don't
brag, and they should,'' Ms. Thomashauer said. ``When you brag
about good, more goodness happens.'' She was dressed in pink silk
Chinese pajamas and gold sandals and took notes on everyone's
brags, which ranged from professional accomplishments (``At work I
said the VP word to my boss, and she said it was possible'') to
romantic accomplishments. (``I asked my physical therapist for
sexual positions for people with bad backs, and my husband and I
went through the whole book this weekend. We both work at home, and
he faxed me love letters from the other end of the apartment three
times this week.'')
</P>
<P>
   After every woman had her turn, Mrs. Thomashauer took a vote for
best brag (``Vote on which brag felt best for you,'' she
counseled), and Sister Goddess Rande, the woman with the love
letters, won by a landslide. I certainly voted for her. ``Well
bragged, well bragged,'' Mrs. Thomashauer said, presenting her with
a feathered fan and a tiara.
</P>
<P>
   The brags were followed by a discussion of the week's homework,
which had included reading Audra Lord's essay ``Uses of the Erotic:
The Erotic as Power.'' The conversation veered toward the Learning
Annex style of self-enlightenment: How to be wonderful and powerful
(and erotic) in three hours or less. What saved it from parody,
though, was that Mrs. Thomashauer is an effective speaker who
imparts the thrill of possibility. There comes a moment when you
think, ``I am wonderful. How could I have forgotten?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else seemed buoyed, too, which was right when Mrs.
Thomashauer introduced an exercise she calls ``withholds,'' where
she asks questions about an intimate topic that could be
interfering with a woman's capacity for sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of owning who you are as a woman is your crotch,'' she
said. ``I want to find out where you are with it. Those who are
confident are happier. By the end of the course, you all will be.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked everyone if there was something they had
withheld, were unable to say, about their vaginas. She went around
the room five times. Many of the women turned red at first, but the
repetition allowed them to start revealing their thoughts and
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a lot more sex than I'm having now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going gray down there is even more upsetting than up here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to scream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was amazing actually, that they could sit in a room full of
strangers and say these things. I kept my own mouth firmly shut.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I left Mama Gena's early, passing on the last
exercise, which was a follow-up to the ``withholds.'' This was a
chance for everyone to either draw, paint or sculpture (with
Play-Doh) a realistic or expressionistic version of their vaginas.
At the summer camp I went to, that was the kind of thing that used
to get you in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Goddess Beth walked me to the door. ``I hope you'll come
back and see us,'' she said kindly. I smiled. ``I might, thanks,''
I said. And I guess I might. I liked the brag part and the being
wonderful part. I even liked the tiara. Now if I could just skip
arts and crafts.

A NIGHT OUT WITH ZAGAT'S WITTIEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the wittiest, go the spoils.''
</P>
<P>
   So it said at the top of the five-course tasting menu offered in
a private room at Le Bernardin recently. For the second time in the
last three years, the publishers of the Zagat restaurant survey
invited their ``wittiest contributors'' to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   These 10 were selected for their skill at compressing a two-hour
dinner into a pithy haiku-like review. Le Bernardin, the top-rated
spot in the 2000 guide, is described as ``piscatory perfection''
and ``expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how witty were the proceedings? Not exactly ``the Algonquin
Round Table.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembled wags included three lawyers, a couple of writers,
an accountant at MTV, an 86-year-old opera singer, a marketing
manager, a recent New York University MBA, and a policeman from
Staten Island. Tim and Nina Zagat presided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like such a serious setting for such funny people,''
Mrs. Zagat said, flattering her guests. ``You're not just funny,
you're descriptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The contributors were more modest. ``I haven't said anything
witty yet,'' said Simon Butler, a writer and editor at AdWeek
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Nieder, the MTV accountant, said her husband had read her
survey and said it was not funny.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lothrop, the police officer, was the first to display
actual wit when he announced himself to the group as ``a failed
anorexic.'' Lothrop is somewhat heavyset, though not from
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk into the station house with my takeout sushi and they
look up from their McDonald's like I'm an alien,'' he said,
nibbling enthusiastically on a small smoked-salmon-and-caviar
croque monsieur.
</P>
<P>
   This was a lot of pressure, being witty on demand. But after
some Champagne and scallops in black truffle sauce, the gang
loosened up and ventured into humor mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the fellow with the ashtray necklace?'' Allan
Hoving, a lawyer at Faulkner &AMP; Gray publishers, said of the
sommelier.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving's favorite restaurant is March in Manhattan. So he was
honored to be the author of the lead comment in March's Zagat
entry: ``Go in like a lion and come out like a lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Hoving, almost none of the
contributors could cite remarks of theirs that had made it into
Zagat 2000. They were surprised to have been invited to the dinner.
``When they called, I thought it was a prank,'' said Alexandra
Schaffrath, the newly minted MBA.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Himes, a lawyer, recalled how he had written that the
famously romantic One if by Land, Two if by Sea should be renamed
Ring in My Hand, Down on My Knee. But that did not make it in.
Asked to train their rapiers on the food and drink in front of
them, the diners veered between ironic understatement and laconic
rapture. Himes described the scallops as ``somewhat better than
lint.'' Ms. Nieder pronounced them ``like buttah.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation fell into awkward silence, Hoving, never at
a loss for hyperbole, exclaimed, ``We're in awe of the great
Zagat!''
</P>
<P>
   In an aside, Mrs. Zagat mentioned that every person who
contributes to the survey buys an average of six copies, because,
she said, ``everyone thinks they came up with `crowded and
noisy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's funny.

COUPLE SAY EXPERIENCE IN REMOTE PLACE IS BEST TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects dateline to Copan Ruinas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPAN RUINAS, Honduras _ Friday, Alex Simon ruefully remembers,
is malaria pill day.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old from Newton, Mass. grinds up half a white tablet
into a teaspoon filled with orange jam. He grimaces, then downs it
as he stands in the dimly lit restaurant overlooking a town square
congested with cowboys, tiny children, and the occasional donkey.
He peers out the window when his younger brother, Ben, points out a
security guard sauntering down the street, shotgun slung across the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It's Day 40 of an education experiment that is pushing lessons
for Alex and his younger sister, Katie, 8 and brother, Ben, 6, out
of the classroom and into some of the most remote places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when thousands of parents across the country are
opting for home schooling, the Simons are going a step further _
educating their children on the road, a self-styled ``adventure''
that includes some of the world's most underdeveloped places.
</P>
<P>
   Their philosophy is similar to those of other home schoolers:
They want to shape their children's lives in accordance with their
own values.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are living in Newton, the big deal can be who got the
latest Pokeman cards,'' said Dick Simon, a real estate developer
who spent a year with his wife backpacking around the world 15
years ago. ``We really believe the experiences (the children) have
will shape them.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most parents agonize over how to protect their
children from the realities of the world, the elder Simons spent
more than a year devising a plan to expose their children to both
its starkness and richness as they travel through Central America,
Asia, Africa, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the trip has been pockmarked with adventures of the
type most parents hope their young children never have to
experience: Thieves in Costa Rica made off with the children's
three backpacks. Among the losses were a beloved stuffed bear,
photographs of friends and favorite mementos from home.
</P>
<P>
   And danger _ from robberies to washed out roads from mudslides _
always lurks.
</P>
<P>
   But the rewards, the Simons say, will be enormous. The couple
passionately hope the trip will give their children a curiosity
that can't be found in traditional classrooms and a perspective
they'll carry for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They want their children to strengthen empathetic values,
realize how varied and large the world is, and embark on countless
explorations of everything from sloths to African anthropology. And
the family time, unrushed for so many months, is invaluable, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   The children spent September, October and most of November in
their classrooms at Cabot Elementary School in Newton to give them
a solid link to home, friends and the school while on the trip.
Then, lugging five pieces of luggage and two laptops, the family
left right after Thanksgiving and plan to return in late August.
</P>
<P>
   The family has a Web page _ www.simonfamily.org. Photos,
comments, and journal entries are posted regularly from the
children to classmates back home.
</P>
<P>
   There will be environmental lessons on the shores of Thailand
and cultural lessons in India's bustling small towns. Just last
week, they got a backstage view of tombs and hieroglyphics at
Copan's Mayan ruins from Newton neighbors who manage an
archeological project there.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Simons are not traveling in cocoons of
comfort in resort compounds and air-conditioned tour buses.
Instead, they are staying in local pensions and hotels to expose
their children to as much culture as possible. They change plans
when they hear of a compelling spot _ last week Mexico was delayed
five days so the family could go to an island off Honduras _ and
sometimes land in a strange country with no idea where they'll stay
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Such travel remains a foreign concept for most American
families. Most couldn't afford the trip the Simons have embarked
on. But in many of the countries the Simons are traveling to, hotel
bills can run under $45 a night for a clean, safe room, and local
meals can run under $15 for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive over time, the Simons say, but not impossible for many
upper middle class families for at least a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Education by experience, however, is traditionally reserved for
older American students in high school or college, after years in
classrooms building an academic foundation and putting the world in
context. Parents and educators appear divided over whether such an
adventure's good outweighs the danger of thrusting younger students
into a world before the child may be able to grasp the concept of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go to Honduras because of the health risks, but I
see tremendous value in experiential learning and hands-on relative
to the real world,'' said Chuck Pretti, principal of the Lincoln
Street School in Northborough, Mass. ``I once took my kids out of
school to see whales beached on Cape Cod, and they learned more
that day than in school. But I see in a lot of parents . . . a
strong desire to protect their children from the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons gave up the idea of truly backpacking with the
children, traveling on local buses and staying in less expensive
hostels like they did 15 years ago. They are only upping it a notch
or two to ensure the children experience the world safely but as
realistically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They have a backpack bulging with everything from Tylenol to
treatment for snakebites. Only the aspirin has been used so far.
The elder Simons spent weeks agonizing which shots and pills their
children should receive to protect them from dysentery and typhoid
while also preventing unnecessary doses of medicine that may have
harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   There only have been minor health problems like stomach aches
and the flu so far, says Alex, and the cool stuff he's seen far
outweighs those down times.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the most amazing thing the Simons have seen so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``A jaguar in the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica,'' said Alex.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest?
</P>
<P>
   ``People with shotguns everywhere,'' said Alex again.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the women who are able to balance baskets on their
heads when they walk, said Ben.
</P>
<P>
   All solemnly agree the worst part of the trip was the first day
in Costa Rica when the family stopped to look at crocodiles off a
bridge shortly after 5 p.m. When they got back to their car, a
window was broken and three backbacks were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Ben cried. Timber, a stuffed bear his teacher had given him, was
taken, as were photos of all the children's friends and teachers.
So were home schooling packets for the first few weeks on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the children recovered, they said, and even joke about it
now. The staff at the Cabot school re-sent pictures. The children
got new schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Homesickness rarely flares. Alex misses pizza. Katie likes to
remember her friends back home. A little tentative on the road,
Ben, a kindergartner, likes to make sure the family is together a
lot and in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Home and friends can also be fetched via the Web _ not
withstanding fallen phone lines or patchy connections.
</P>
<P>
   The children e-mail friends about Ben and Alex's birthday
parties, and in turn, their friends back home let them know the
latest news in the classroom and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Academic lessons sometimes take a back seat to witnessing a
volcano or watching scarlet macaws, but the children catch up
during down times. The family practices letters and spelling with
Ben during long car rides from airports to rain forests or ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Alex already can recite scores of animal and insect names native
to Central America. The family stops at the sight of every strange
bug to analyze, remember, and later look up on the Web or in a book
if they can't readily identify it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the family toured the Mayan ruins of Copan, the
children stood quietly, sometimes absorbing the tales of ball
courts, human sacrifices, and ancient rulers told by William and
Barbara Fash, the Simons' next-door neighbors in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   And as in any classroom, anywhere, the children sometimes simply
looked bored.

 &HT;    TEN-MONTH MEXICAN STUDENT STRIKE ERODES FURTHER AFTER REFERENDUM
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For nearly 10 months one of the world's largest
public universities has been paralyzed by a student strike no
Mexican politician has been savvy enough to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a radical core, the strikers have grown increasingly
isolated from a public that once sympathized with their basic
demands. Even liberal newspapers here have turned their backs,
mocking the strikers as rebels without a cause and foolish brats
decked out in Che Guevara shirts, phony dreadlocks and multiple
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Mexico's National Autonomous University,
or UNAM, gave in months ago to the students' primary demand to keep
the university's fees only a few cents a year rather than hiking it
up to $70 a semester. But the strikers still have grievances _ some
of which appear murky to many Mexicans _ and remain barricaded on
campuses that are normally bustling with more than 270,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the strikers suffered a public-relations
setback many Mexicans hope could help bring the conflict to a
climax and finally yield a solution. The UNAM's newly appointed
rector, former Mexican Health Minister Ramon de la Fuente,
organized a referendum to allow students and employees to vote on
whether they believe his latest proposal should be accepted and the
strike called off.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 150,000 votes were cast, according to initial reports
Friday. But more than 86 percent of participants said they
supported the proposal, which would retain the university's
traditionally free tuition as well as establish a congress in which
students could help determine university policies.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was held Thursday, the day after the striking
students held their own two-day balloting in a bid to gauge public
support for their cause. The students haven't announced the results
of their vote and pressure is on them now to respond to what is
perceived as a coup for the rector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize this has legitimacy, even though not very many
people voted,'' admitted strike supporter Karina Mucino, 23, an
education major who was standing at a roadblock on the edge of
campus Friday making sure that only a relative handful of
maintenance and research employees entered the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Mucino said the rector's referendum isn't going to
automatically convince strikers to open the university.
</P>
<P>
   She said it would be wise at this point for the strike council
to sit down and negotiate over de la Fuente's proposal and haggle
over the bones of contention. The strikers, for example, are
sticking to their demand that high school students at
UNAM-affiliated schools be allowed automatic passage to the
university. The rector rejects that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Law student Gerardo Becerril, also 23, said he voted in both
referendums for the strike to end. ``I'm not against the strike
council,'' he said, explaining that he supported the initial
demands to keep free tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in Mexico the only way to get the authorities'
attention is to do something dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said the striking students have lost their focus,
allowed the movement to be hijacked by radicals known as ``ultras''
and permitted vandals to deface the campus.
</P>
<P>
   His hope is that the rector's pledge to establish a university
congress that includes students _ another strike demand _ will help
revamp the university and make it more financially sound.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAM was born with Mexico's 1910 Revolution, which was
supposed to rid the country of extreme inequality. For many of
Mexico's poor and working class, it is the only option to obtain a
college degree.
</P>
<P>
   The government has declined to force an end to the strike,
mindful that Mexicans still remember when troops killed protesting
students in 1968 when soldiers opened fire on them in a public
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Some strikers admit that there are students who could have
clearly afforded a $70 semester fee. But they say they fear a
gradual slide into a free-market educational system in Mexico. Some
of their concern appears to stem from the government's steps in
recent years to privatize state-run industries, an experiment that
has yielded a mixed bag of successful ventures and financial
disasters. Mexico's privatized banks, for example, collapsed under
a burden of bad loans and corrupt practices, leaving the government
to use public money to help sustain those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has money to rescue crooked bankers,'' Mucino
said, ``but it says it doesn't have money for education.''

&HT;     THE LONESOME IOWA NON-CAMPAIGN OF JOHN MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The office in Joan Fitzpatrick Bolin's
upscale home on the western edge of this city is about as close as
Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gets
to a campaign HQ in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   A 54-year-old lawyer and homemaker, Bolin has the names and
numbers of a small cadre of McCain supporters in Iowa. Her office
has a few McCain campaign placards that adorned McCain's vehicles
during two Iowa Republican debates that he participated in.
</P>
<P>
   Defeated in her bid for state treasurer last year, she has an
idea of what it takes to wage a state-wide campaign. She's all
revved up for Monday night when registered voters will meet in
small party caucuses around the state to select delegates for the
Republican and Democratic nominating conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she has everything she needs except one thing: A
participating candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision last year to pass up the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses
and instead focus on New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary left Bolin
feeling `aggravated,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decided not to compete in part because Iowa's caucus
system favors well-financed candidates backed by the party
organization, a category that on the GOP side includes publishing
scion Steve Forbes and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Also, McCain is the only Republican candidate who opposes the
federal tax break for ethanol, a fuel additive derived from corn
that is a Holy Grail in Iowa politics. He has voted against the tax
break because of his overall attack against lobby groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Bolin will drive to her local precinct caucus
in her Honda with a McCain bumper sticker and there she will speak
out for her man, even if she's the only one in the room to do so.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may get 2 percent of the Republican caucus vote. If he
beats some of the other low-polling candidates such as conservative
activist Gary Bauer, radio commentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, `I'd be thrilled,'' she said. `But it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   `I identify with McCain, absolutely,'' Bolin said in her
rat-a-tat-tat speaking style. `I don't mince words, I'm straight
forward, and I'm willing to take the heat for who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Bolin is explains why she's ringleader of the lonesome
battle to bring McCain at least a few caucus votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bolin is the granddaughter of former Iowa Republican Rep. Ben
Jensen, who served 26 years in the House of Representatives
starting in the 1930s, rising to become the top Republican on the
House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, she worked for the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission in Chicago before moving to Des Moines 13 years
ago. Eventually she was appointed the state's assistant treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   She earned a reputation as a whistle-blower after being
dismissed in 1991 following a statewide financial scandal involving
misappropriation of city and county investment funds in a trust run
by a crooked California investment adviser. Bolin got headlines
when she charged her boss with being asleep at the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The vilification and isolation that followed were personally
devastating. Her suffering was not comparable to the years McCain
spent as a POW during the Vietnam War, she said, but when McCain
threw his hat in the ring, she found his story compelling.
</P>
<P>
   `What I see in McCain is a straight-forward man, someone who's
been through a lot,'' she said. `There's a sense of someone going
through suffering and isolation, trying to hold on to who you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Bolin hosted a fundraiser for McCain in her home and
got to meet him personally. She began raising funds for him so he
could campaign for last summer's Iowa straw poll. But the
multi-million-dollar pricetag staggered her and McCain decided to
stay out of Iowa altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to ethanol was a key part of McCain's calculus. At
least one other ethanol opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
reversed his long-standing opposition to the ethanol tax break
before starting to compete in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   McCain didn't do that, instead parlaying his anti-ethanol stance
to burnish his reputation in New Hampshire as the candidate who
opposes special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iowans see ethanol as a cornerstone of their prospering
economy. The Iowa Corn Growers Association estimates that ethanol
generates $1.7 billion in economic activity in Iowa as well as
13,250 jobs and needed income for the state's 80,000 corn farmers.
Ethanol in gasoline reduces oil imports by 100,000 barrels day and
lowers carbon monoxide emissions 30 percent, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   But ethanol has proven controversial, with some lawmakers in
Washington denouncing it as a classic pork-barrel project. The
General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, reported
in 1997 that the 1970s-vintage ethanol tax break had deprived the
U.S. Treasury of $1.7 billion in tax receipts and had `little
effect'' on air pollution or reducing dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is not in dispute: Ethanol resonates with Iowa voters,
particularly in rural areas. Don Newton, a 36-year-old Republican
farmer in Blairstown, east of Des Moines, said he was unsure who
he'd pick Monday night, but `I will not vote for McCain. He just
slapped us all in the face by some of the comments he made'' on
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Bolin shrugs at such stories and plays the what-if scenario in
her mind: What if McCain had competed? Could he have countered some
of the negativity over ethanol with his positions on campaign
finance reform and paying off the national debt?
</P>
<P>
   Bolin and the rest of Iowa will never know. Bolin's role as
chief of the McCain non-campaign in Iowa has been limited to
arranging for cars and drivers for McCain's two debate appearances
in the state. Also, she distributed to veterans' groups all the
debate tickets allotted to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a reporter on a tour of her office, she notes the
cat-liter box, TV set and Nintendo game set up. She laughs that
some reporters have called her on the theory that she's running a
secret McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't think so,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm disappointed, but that's life,'' she added. `You've got to
make choices and McCain made his. I'll do what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolin's work for McCain isn't a family project. Her 14-year-old
daughter, Megan, works as a volunteer for the Bush campaign.

REBEL FLAG TATTOO MAY BE EVIDENCE IN TEXAS COURT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge is expected to rule next week on
whether a Confederate flag tattoo will be admitted into evidence in
a race discrimination case against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two black employees working as inspectors for the Department of
Public Works and Engineering sued the city, claiming they were
passed over for promotions two years ago by Chief Inspector Dan
Petrash, who has a Confederate flag tattooed on his forearm.
</P>
<P>
   The two employees, Louella Henderson Jones and Herbert Williams
III, believe the tattoo is a symbol of racism and provides evidence
of Petrash's attitude toward blacks, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The employees also allege that Petrash, who had the hiring
authority, made racist remarks and told other employees that he
wanted a white man for the job because the Public Works Department
already had three black senior supervisory inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion went to a white employee.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents indicate Petrash denies making racial remarks or
that he didn't want to hire a black employee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas, who has requested a news
blackout on the case, is reportedly concerned that the flag will
inflame the jury because of the recent protests in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag, which flies over the Statehouse in South
Carolina, has become a hot-button issue in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Groups who say the flag must come down view it as a symbol of
slavery and racism. Some have launched a tourism boycott of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-flag groups see it as a sign of Southern heritage and argue
it should continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas allowed the flag to be admitted into evidence in an
earlier trial, which ended with a hung jury Tuesday. But because of
all the recent attention and debate surrounding the South Carolina
Statehouse flag, the judge is reconsidering its admissibility.
</P>
<P>
   The new trial is scheduled to begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Fleming, assistant city attorney, refused to comment because
he said he doesn't want to try the case in the newspaper. Besides,
he said, Atlas requested that the parties refrain from discussing
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Employment lawyer Joe Ahmad, who is representing Jones and
Williams, also said he didn't want to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said Dawn Bennett-Alexander, associate professor of
employment law and legal studies at the Terry College of Business
at the University of Georgia in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is a jury question, said Bennett-Alexander, who
specializes in race and sex discrimination. It's not enough to turn
away from it and think it doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a long connection between racism and the
Confederate flag, she said. It's up to the jury if it wants to make
that connection, especially if there have been other signs of
racism.
</P>
<P>
   What gets lost in all the rhetoric is that the Confederate flag
has been a rallying cry for the Ku Klux Klan, she said. It's a bit
ingenuous to claim it stands for Southern heritage because it has
come to mean so much more.
</P>
<P>
   That the manager has the tattoo doesn't mean he's guilty of
racism, but taken in a context of racial remarks and actions, a
tattoo of a Confederate flag could indicate someone's overall
attitude, said H. Joan Ehrlich, district director of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He has the right to put a tattoo on his body, but he has to
accept the consequence that it may offend people, Ehrlich said. As
a manager he should know it may offend others and should cover it
up at work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the baggage of the Confederate flag, it's still a
popular tattoo. Flash's Tattoo Studio in nearby Rosenberg sells
many Confederate flags each week.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's not a big giant request,'' said Keno Parker, a tattoo
artist. Barbed wire and ``tribal art'' _ pictures adapted from
ancient Asian and Native American designs _ are the biggest
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he suspects some of his customers choose the
Confederate flag because of their Southern heritage or the way it
looks.
</P>
<P>
   But racism? Parker isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into personal relationships with my customers,''
he said.

 &HT;    ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: A HEART OUT OF WHACK
 &HT;    With HEART-SYMPTOMS. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An estimated 2 million Americans suffer from one
form or another of atrial fibrillation, the heart condition that
has several times briefly interrupted campaigning by Democratic
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For many of them, the disorder amounts to little more than a
nuisance, although if not properly treated it can lead to a stroke,
according to the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac electrophysiologists, the specialists who deal with the
way electric currents regulate the heartbeat, said Friday that
atrial fibrillation can be managed in several ways and should not
affect Bradley's ability to serve as president, should he be
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush experienced at least one episode of the
heart disorder while in office. In his case, the heart arrhythmia
apparently grew out of a thyroid condition.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Thursday he has experienced four episodes of the
irregular heartbeat since disclosing Dec. 10 that he had the
condition. In all four incidents, his heart rhythm returned to
normal _ ``converted'' _ without treatment, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working with a doctor to manage atrial fibrillation, people
can
</P>
<P>
   keep it under control and minimize its effects,'' heart
association said in a statement released Friday. ``When handled
appropriately, the condition normally doesn't interfere with
regular day-to-day function.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mina Chung, a cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist
at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, explained that the
disorder occurs when electrical currents that pulse through the
heart, causing its chambers to contract and push blood through the
arteries and veins, get out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, these currents are regulated at two areas of the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sinus node'' at an upper area of the right atrium manages
the pulses that flow through the two atria, causing the smaller
heart chambers to contract and force blood into the larger
ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical pulses then must pass through an area known as
the atrioventricular node, the electrical gatekeeper to the
ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pause at the atrioventricular node, the impulses
spread through the ventricles, causing them to contract and push
the blood into the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   In atrial fibrillation, the regulation of electrical current at
the sinus node is lost and impulses spread rapidly and repeatedly
through the atria. The uncontrolled impulses can range as high as
300 to 600 beats per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The atrioventricular node usually re-establishes control over
the electric current before it passes to the ventricles, so that
the pulse rate rarely rises over 150 beats per minute.
</P>
<P>
   However, the uncontrolled atrial action means the delivery of
blood to the ventricles is impaired and the heart's overall
efficiency often is reduced by 20 to 30 percent. In some cases,
drugs or electric stimulation is used to cause the heart to shift
back into normal gear.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for one of the main dangers of atrial
fibrillation, Chung explained. Because the blood is not flowing
smoothly through the atria, it is more likely to clot. Should a
clot dislodge and travel to the brain, it can cause a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of stroke among persons with atrial fibrillation is
between 3 and 7 percent a year, or approximately five times higher
than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the seriousness of the fibrillation, persons with
the disorder may be required to take blood thinners _ ranging from
aspirin to warfarin _ to control the stroke risk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, who said she would not hesitate to vote for someone for
president solely because he had atrial fibrillation, said the
condition can be managed with medication.
</P>
<P>
   Causes of the condition can range from underlying cardiovascular
problems such as valve disease and coronary artery disease to
stress, hypertension, excessive caffeine, electrolyte or metabolic
imbalances, hyperthyroidism and even severe infections.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the cause is never identified.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on atrial fibrillation, see the American
Heart Association's Internet page, www.Americanheart.org, and the
Cleveland Clinic's page, www.clevelandclinic.org.

<P>
   Causes of the condition can range from underlying cardiovascular
problems such as valve disease and coronary artery disease to
stress, hypertension, excessive caffeine, electrolyte or metabolic
imbalances, hyperthyroidism and even severe infections.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the cause is never identified.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty five years ago, when Christopher Curtis was
working at the Fisher Body Plant in Flint, Mich., hanging doors on
Buicks one a minute, he would hallucinate at night about the
assembly line. He would see the door frame in his sleep, waiting to
be clamped onto a car. He would feel his bed moving underneath him.
The only way he could escape the line's indelible imprint was to
write. But Curtis never dreamed he could ever be a ``real'' writer.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed now. Curtis, 46, has just won the Newbery
Medal, the most important literary prize for childrens' books, and
the Coretta Scott King Author Award for excellence by an
African-American writer for his novel ``Bud, Not Buddy,'' published
by Delacorte Press last September. He is the first person to win
both awards at once, and the first black man ever to win the
Newbery, one of the few literary awards that translates immediately
into big sales.
</P>
<P>
   After Curtis, who lives in Windsor, Ontario, won this week, the
book jumped from 5,400th to fifth on the Amazon.com best-seller
list. ``It was above all the Harry Potter books,'' said Curtis,
with amazement in his voice, as he sat over lunch at the Millennium
Broadway Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said he never set out to write a young adults' book. All
that has ever mattered to him, he said, was to tell a story. ``Bud,
Not Buddy'' is set in the segregated, Depression-era Midwest, in a
period of social unrest. The book, which could easily be an adult
novel, is a Dickensian tale of exaggerated characters and
idiosyncratic humor. Ten-year-old Bud (``not Buddy,'' he insists)
escapes a cruel foster home and searches for a famous jazz
musician, Herman E. Caldwell, leader of a group called the ``Dusky
Devastators of the Depression!!!!!!,'' whom he thinks is his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Bud has his own rules for negotiating a treacherous world.
Example: ``If a Adult Tells You Not to Worry, and You Weren't
Worried Before, You Better Hurry Up and Start 'Cause You're Already
Running Late.'' Bud finds temporary refuge in a Hooverville and is
eventually rescued by Lefty Lewis, a Pullman porter, labor
organizer and former pitcher in the Negro Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' own grandfather was Earl (Lefty) Lewis, a redcap and a
pitcher in what became the Negro Baseball Leagues. Curtis' paternal
grandfather, Herman E. Curtis, a violinist trained at the Indiana
Conservatory, also had a jazz group called ``the Dusky Devastators
of the Depression!!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis himself was born in Flint. His father, Herman E. Curtis
Jr., a chiropodist, was a member of Flint's black professional
class. His mother, Leslie, a homemaker, graduated from Michigan
State University. Herman Curtis deferred payments for poor patients
and was forced to take a job at Fisher Body. In 1971, Christopher,
a bookish child with a strict upbringing, enrolled at the
University of Michigan in Flint. He has never earned a degree. In
1972, to make money, he followed his father onto the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Today Curtis, a big man at 6-foot-2, who weighed 180 pounds in
those days, still remembers picking up the 80-pound car doors:
``You slide it in, start walking back. Six bolts went into the
hinges. It was almost like a ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stress to you enough how much I hated it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a sporting event in Hamilton, Ontario, Curtis met Kaysandra
Sookram, who is originally from Trinidad. They married and have two
children, Steven, 21, who is in the Navy, and Cydney, 8, who holds
the copyright for the song ``Mommy Says No'' in ``Bud, Not Buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis finally quit the line in 1985. He worked as a maintenance
man, a customer service representative for a utility company, a
campaign worker for Donald W. Riegle Jr., a former Michigan
senator. Curtis' wife had been impressed by his long letters to her
in Canada during their courtship. She believed her husband could
write a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Why is he wasting his time doing a job he really
doesn't like?''' said Mrs. Curtis, who is a nurse. She offered to
support him for a year so he could write what became his first
novel, ``The Watsons Go to Birmingham _ 1963,'' about 10-year-old
Kenny and his family, who visit Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 and get
caught up in events based on the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church
bombing in which four African-American girls were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis didn't think of it as a childrens' book, he said. ``It
just happened to be in the voice of a 10-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his first recognition when an early draft of ``The
Watsons'' won a Hopwood Prize for excellence in writing from the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He also entered it in two
competitions for young adult fiction sponsored by Little, Brown and
Delacorte Press. ``How else would I get it read?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown rejected it, but Wendy Lamb, an editor at
Delacorte, accepted the book. The novel was published in 1995. In
1996, it won a Newbery Honor Award, and it has sold 400,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Curtis is writing several books, both for
children and for adults. One is about a factory worker who abuses
his wife, a dark subject, and he is struggling with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's rationalizing the things he's doing,'' said Curtis. ``But
I can't make him so horrible that readers won't want to read about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator is an adult. ``I know I was supposed to target an
audience,'' said Curtis. But for Curtis, the most important thing,
always, is just to tell a good story.

EXPLAINING THE URGE TO COLLECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

(lh) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In prehistoric caves dating back 40,000 years, archaeologists
have discovered strange curios, including shells and oddly shaped
lumps of iron pyrite. They are, the scientists believe, the first
evidence of the human impulse to collect.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of collecting has certainly come a long way since.
Indeed, today it has become a cliche that virtually anything _ from
high art to swizzle sticks _ is being collected by somebody
somewhere. The tremendous popularity of auction sites on the
Internet has opened a window on a world in which thousands of
people are willing to bid for objects that even some of the sellers
previously thought were worthless.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that compels people to collect? For years the
collections themselves received the most attention. In the 1920s,
researchers compiled inventories of them. But more recently the
motivations of collectors have become a hot topic among academics
as part of an intensifying focus on material culture and
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Pearce, a professor at the University of Leicester in
England who has done research on collecting, said the act itself
received little academic attention in the past because it is on the
cusp of several disciplines including psychology, sociology,
history, economics and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, she added, social scientists have begun
to look more closely at the relationship between people and objects
after spending years concentrated on the production of goods. She
is now supervising graduate students researching dissertations on
collecting, in the ancient world and now.
</P>
<P>
   If collectors were largely ignored by academics in the past,
they have been a preoccupation of novelists, filmmakers and
journalists. The popular image they have shaped is often
contradictory. Balzac's ``Cousin Pons,'' published in 1847,
depicted a collector who does not appreciate the value of his
collection and is duped by his wealthy relatives. John Fowles' 1963
novel ``The Collector'' is about a psychotic butterfly collector
who kidnaps a beautiful art student.
</P>
<P>
   The title character in ``Utz,'' a 1989 novel by Bruce Chatwin,
is obsessed with his collection of Meissen porcelain figurines. And
last year's ``Orchid Thief,'' by the New Yorker writer Susan
Orlean, is a study of a man so passionate about the flowers that he
is willing to risk arrest in order to obtain and clone a rare
specimen.
</P>
<P>
   These books and others portray the collector as, at best, a
harmless or pathetic eccentric and, at worst, a malevolent demon.
In both cases, the objects collected become substitutes for failed
human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also the rival images of the collector, fostered
mostly by the press, as an erudite preserver of civilization,
generous philanthropist and wily speculator.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors themselves do not always mind the negative
stereotype. ``People use `obsession,' `addiction' and
`collectaholic' to describe their own behavior in a way they
wouldn't if they were addicted to alcohol or drugs,'' said Russell
W. Belk, a professor at the University of Utah who studies
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new academic research contradicts the idea that
collecting represents aberrant behavior. Both Ms. Pearce, working
in Britain, and Belk, working in the United States, found that
about one of every three people in both countries collect
something.
</P>
<P>
   Belk said that his research did not include collections of
records, CDs or photographs, which would categorize virtually
everyone as a collector. He defines a collection as a coherent set
that is filled in a systematic and continuing way. In addition,
items that enter a collection are taken out of use, or they are
used only on a special occasion. But a collection does not have to
contain objects only. Bird watchers can be seen as collecting their
various sightings, and a Don Juan can be viewed as collecting
sexual conquests.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys found that collecting is split evenly between men
and women and cuts across all socioeconomic classes. But it occurs
only in developed countries in North America, Europe and Asia. Ms.
Pearce believes that collecting gathered momentum after the
Industrial Revolution in England in the early 1800s spawned the
modern consumer economy. Few collectors ever make a profit from
their collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 33 percent of people are doing it, you can't really call it
peculiar,'' Ms. Pearce said in an interview. ``These people have
cars, children, homes. They all live normal lives. It's not a
symptom of weirdness or deviance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that there were extreme examples of obsessive
collectors but then, she observed, extreme behavior can be found in
any large community.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found that people collect for a variety of reasons,
like creating a sense of self-worth, establishing an identity, or
striving for a sense of immortality. ``We are creating a small
world where we feel secure,'' Belk said. ``We can succeed because
we have defined success narrowly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that collecting actually increased during the
Great Depression in the 1930s. Even a jobless collectors could feel
that they were doing humanity a favor by preserving something.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Danet, a sociologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
conducted a study of collecting among adults in Israel in the mid
1980s. She and her colleague, Tamar Katriel of the University of
Haifa, concluded that people who collected were ``striving for a
sense of closure, completion and perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   They identified five strategies used by their subjects:
completing a series, filling a space, creating a visually pleasing
display, manipulating the scale of objects, and aspiring to perfect
objects, as in restoring a vintage car to mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Muensterberger, a New York psychoanalyst, claims that the
root of the collecting impulse comes from the collector's attempt
to use objects as a salve for emotional pain experienced in
childhood. Just as a child fixates on a toy or blanket as a source
of comfort when parents are missing, he explains in his book
``Collecting: An Unruly Passion'' (Princeton University Press,
1994), so, too, the objects in a collection become a substitute for
that absent emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   The poster boy for Muensterberger's theory (though he is not
mentioned in his book) is the fictional Charles Foster Kane in the
1941 movie classic ``Citizen Kane.'' Heir to a mining fortune but
ripped away from his parents as a small boy, Kane becomes an
obsessive collector as an adult, stocking Xanadu, his palatial
estate, with thousands of objects. But he dies pining for his
boyhood sled, the symbol of his lost childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated acquisitions serve as a vehicle to cope with inner
uncertainty,'' Muensterberger writes, ``a way of dealing with the
dread of renewed anxiety, with confusing problems of need and
longing,''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearce of the University of Leicester, however, called
Muensterberger's book ``Bloody awful.'' She faults it for
reinforcing the stereotype that collecting is a form of deviant
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Muensterberger, who is an expert on African art and has
several pieces on display in his New York apartment, said in an
interview that his theory did not mean that every collector was a
neurotic, though he believes the impulse for neurosis comes from
the same place. ``There is an unneurotic side to collecting: the
search for knowledge, the sense of taste, the need for
accomplishment,'' he said. ``That can border on the obsessional. It
can become deviant.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, of the many historical examples cited in his book,
Muensterberger skips over one that would appear to be significant.
Sigmund Freud was an ardent collector of ancient Greek, Roman and
Egyptian antiquities, amassing a collection of more than 3,000
objects before his death.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was clearly important to Freud's work. He
displayed the items only in the two rooms where he saw patients and
wrote, not in the family quarters. When he was forced to flee
Vienna after the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, Freud sold his
library of books but made sure that his antiquities collection went
with him to England. The position of each piece in Vienna was
carefully noted, then recreated after the collection arrived at the
Freuds' new home in London.
</P>
<P>
   John Forrester, who teaches history and philosophy of science at
Cambridge University and has written several books on Freud,
believes that collecting was integral to the development of Freud's
theories. In an essay in ``The Cultures of Collecting'' (Harvard
University Press, 1994), he noted that Freud began collecting in
1896, after the death of his father, which Freud admitted was a
traumatic time in his life. Forrester then goes on to note that
Freud also collected dreams, case studies and Jewish anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late 1890s was the most significant period in Freud's
development of psychoanalysis,'' Forrester wrote, ``which was
founded upon the idiosyncratic collections he established at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Muensterberger said that he did not include Freud in his book
because he did not know enough. Freud very rarely wrote about his
own collecting, he added. ``It must have had a very significant
undisclosed meaning to him, which we can only guess at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, to paraphrase Freud, sometimes a collection is just
a collection.

`THE   TROUBLE WITH PRINCIPLE': A PROVOCATEUR FOR WHOM LIBERAL
PRINCIPLES ARE A SHAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.)

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I was to berate Stanley Fish the way some of his critics have
_ calling him a ``trafficker in scurrility,'' a ``morally
disgusting'' writer, an ``intellectual boot-boy'' _ then Fish, a
professorial lover of polemic, might even get a certain amount of
pleasure out of the diatribe. But he also might point out that the
name calling itself is not objectionable; it's just ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The disgust at his supposed scurrility will neither change his
own beliefs nor convince anybody else to join in opposition. Far
more interesting, he might suggest, would be to attack him in the
name of liberal democracy, raising high the banner of principle,
invoking reason, fairness and truth.
</P>
<P>
   Then he could really tear his opponents to shreds. For Fish,
principle, reason, fairness and truth are fighting words. With the
sophistical sophistication that made him one of the highest paid
professors in the United States when he headed Duke University's
English Department, Fish has woven together recent essays into
``The Trouble With Principle'' (Harvard).
</P>
<P>
   Their shared argument is that liberal principle _ that grand
achievement of the Enlightenment, that belief in a government of
laws, that conviction that every individual deserves respect _ is
bunk. It doesn't really exist and a lot of very bad things are done
in its name.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: academic freedom is a ``bad idea,'' the doctrine
of free speech is ``conceptually incoherent'' and the ``vocabulary
of toleration'' is an ``incoherent ideal.'' All the principled
``mantras of liberal theory,'' he says, are immoral.
</P>
<P>
   This might make Fish, who is now dean of the College of Liberal
Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, sound
like a paleoconservative celebrating a mythic past before notions
of equality and principle messed things up. But that is not Fish's
complaint. He actually likes a lot of the results of liberalism;
what he objects to is the pretense that it is superior to any other
doctrine. And his attacks are so smartly provocative that they are
worth reading if only to examine why they are also so misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, Fish proposes, a principle like academic freedom. It
sounds quite noble, but it can never be easily applied in a
particular situation. But what if a religious fundamentalist wished
to teach his religion in the classroom? Advocates of academic
freedom would instantly say the principle doesn't apply because
fundamentalism has already rejected the university's detached quest
for truth. But truth is what fundamentalism believes has already
been found; from its point of view, academic debate is
unprincipled. There is, Fish argues, no way to settle this
conflict; both views create restrictions, even the so-called
``open'' one. ``Academic freedom is not a defense against
orthodoxy,'' Fish declares. ``It is an orthodoxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberalism, in Fish's analysis, has shored itself up with just
such grand empty concepts. Liberalism enshrines reason and pretends
disinterested nobility. But its notions are actually self-serving
for a small group of believers. Liberalism preaches tolerance. But
that means taking no point of view too seriously. Liberalism, like
every system of belief, is just another form of narrow-minded,
self-serving politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of this attack are not unfamiliar. Conservatives
have attacked liberalism for making fetishes of tolerance and
diversity. And 20th- century Marxist critics have given a scornful
analysis of liberal pretense. But conservatives cite other
principles. And Marxists also believe in principles that should
create a just society. Fish rejects all such transcendent standards
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules, only a messy adjustment to each situation.
Without immutable principles, the only thing possible, Fish
proposes, is a form of ``inspired adhoccery.'' Conflicting ideas
must make their own way, case by case, continually vying for
supremacy. Fish's society is red in tooth and claw; survival is the
only judge.
</P>
<P>
   But then on what foundation are these conflicting ideas
developed? What guides one's adhoccery? ``Figure out what you think
is right and then look around for ways to be true to it'' is Fish's
advice. But ``right'' on what grounds? Fish speaks of ``strong
moral intuitions as to how the world should go.'' But where do
``moral intuitions'' come from and what is the nature of this
``should''?
</P>
<P>
   Fish champions affirmative action, for example, and argues for
it by implicitly applying notions of fairness and consistency that
he elsewhere attacks. He also seems to rely heavily on the use of
reason _ whose authority he has also treated as a chimera of
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In his radical iconoclasm, Fish might respond: ``So what? It
doesn't matter how I make my case since we are all talking to one
another from our own closed worlds. Why not use liberal arguments
to convince liberals of the futility of their liberalism?
Everything is textual strategy anyway.'' Every discourse, as Fish
proposes in his literary-critical mode, ``is an engine of exclusion
and therefore a means of coercion.'' Why should his be any
different? So much the better if it works!
</P>
<P>
   But outside the world of Fish's celebrity, does it work? Fish's
discourse is actually based on a fiction: a notion that a political
principle is meant to be absolute. But principle is not meant to be
absolute. ``Do unto others'' is a principle, but its application
requires careful judgment of context; there might even be
exceptions. This doesn't mean principle doesn't exist or isn't
important.
</P>
<P>
   Some principles are extreme, some misguided, some profound, some
scurrilous. But all have exceptions. Even Fish's principled
unprincipledness might have to give way now and then to the
villainy of fairness and reason.

BRODERBUND HAS ART-FULL OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Years and years ago, I wrote about a clip-art program that
supplied ``dozens'' of pictures for use in documents and
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so later, the clip-art collections were providing
``hundreds'' of photos, drawings and cartoons. By the time
high-density floppy disks were in vogue, the numbers were in the
thousands; CD-ROMs elevated them to the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Before things reached into the millions, Broderbund simply did
away with the numbers with ClickArt Infinity. It's a little like
Bill Gates' fortune: After you've amassed the first billion
dollars, why bother keeping count?
</P>
<P>
   But if you are into numbers, ClickArt Infinity is actually a
finite number. There are more than 500,000 images, photos, and Web
graphics that can be used in cards, newsletters, Web pages,
PowerPoint presentations and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are a specific number of images on the disks,
the ``Infinity'' title still applies, since the program goes far
behind just a collection of pictures. More about that in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The images are scattered over 20 CDs (Windows; about $45-$50).
If the images aren't just right, they can be changed using
ClickEdit, the program's built-in editing tool. Graphics can have
color changed. Images can be blurred, backgrounds can be altered,
and drawings can be embossed, cloned and rotated. Special
techniques, like combining a face from one picture with the
background of another, are also available. The program has special
effects for pictures, including one that looks like bubbles have
been blown in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   With all those images, it can be difficult to find the right
one, so the program's indexing system works by both keyword search
and name of the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: A version of The Print Shop, Broderbund's
best-selling publishing program. It can be used to create a project
from scratch, or used with 4,500 templates for making greeting
cards, invitations, flyers and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: The program also includes 3D Greetings ClickArt
Edition, which lets users send animated greetings over the
Internet. The greetings, like other projects, can be customized.

 &HT;    'HOLOCAUST DENIER' TRIAL HEADS INTO THIRD WEEK IN BRITAIN

   LONDON _ A controversial historical writer is expected to be
assailed in court Monday over his assertion that it is a ``big
lie'' that Jews were slaughtered in gas chambers at Auschwitz
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving dismisses the gas chambers seen by visitors to the
infamous camp in Poland as fakes that were built after the end of
World War II by the Polish government.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who believes the Nazi campaign to exterminate Jews has
been greatly exaggerated, is suing Emory University professor
Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for libel over
assertions made about him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt portrayed Irving as a prominent and dangerous
``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took place. She
also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and
falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, lead defense attorney Richard Rampton is expected to
challenge of Irving on the writer's statements about Auschwitz,
arguably the most notorious of the so-called Nazi death camps.
Rampton intends to call expert witnesses to validate the accepted
account of the mass killings at Auschwitz _ including at least 1
million deaths in gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which opened nearly two weeks ago, has been divided
into two segments _ the first focusing on Irving's views of the
Holocaust and Adolf Hitler's role in the mass killings. Irving has
maintained that Hitler didn't know about the campaign to
exterminate Jews until 1943, at least two years after the massacres
began.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said he doesn't deny the Holocaust but says it has been
exaggerated. He challenges the number and manner of Jewish deaths
in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   But Irving already has been forced to concede on major points.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old author of about 30 historical books has been
forced to admit in court that he based part of his claim about
Hitler's attempts to stop the mass murders on a misreading of a
1941 handwritten note from Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler. Irving
also has acknowledged that he was wrong in asserting that the Nazis
never employed exhaust fumes from trucks to kill Jews on a large
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Irving accepted documents presented by the
defense that showed that he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, Irving denies that these mistakes prove that he
distorted or manipulated historical facts to suit his purposes. He
maintains that he believed his positions when he espoused them and
was unaware of evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt and Penguin Books deny they libeled Irving, and under
British law are required to prove that the book portrayed him
truthfully. Irving, who is not a lawyer, is representing himself in
the trial, which is expected to last three months.

&HT;     IOWA INDUSTRIAL TOWN GIRDS FOR FIGHT BY THE UNDERDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ If the Democratic and Republican contenders
trailing Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are
to pull off Waterloos in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, then this
gritty industrial town of 66,000 is as good a place as any to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 years ago near the Belgian town of Waterloo,
England's Duke of Wellington defeated a more powerful army under
Napoleon, forcing the diminutive French leader to abdicate for a
second time.
</P>
<P>
   To score a similar upset or even get a modest lift out of Iowa,
the underdogs _ former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democrat,
and Republican Steve Forbes, who is shown by polls running second
to Bush in the state _ would have to do well in Waterloo, the
state's fifth largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses involve a process in which each party holds
precinct-by-precinct meetings for the purpose of selecting a
presidential nominee. The caucus votes are several steps removed
from the actual delegate-selection process in the state, but they
have symbolic value as the first voting exercise in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, Bush and Gore command solid leads. The same is true
in Waterloo and surrounding Black Hawk County. While local
organizers for Bradley and Forbes are optimistic, they are not
holding their breath for an upset.
</P>
<P>
   How it got to be that way is the story of politics in Iowa in
general and the economic and social development of this city in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   All of Iowa's Midwestern qualities are on display in Waterloo,
which is 160 miles northeast of Des Moines. ``It has industry, blue
collar, white collar, farming, you name it,'' said Karen Slifka,
30, a Waterloo native who is organizing the region for the Forbes
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The tractor-maker Deere and Co. and the massive IBP Co. pork
production plant are the dominant employers. Both are intertwined
with the state's agricultural economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of 74,000 registered voters in the county, 24,000 are Democrats.
Of those, about 30 percent are union members, according to Maggie
Stewart, a waitress and former hairdresser who heads the Black Hawk
County Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20,000 registered Republicans, but the bulk of voters
_ 30,000 _ are in neither party.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush has benefited from inheriting the
strong local organization built by Elizabeth Dole, who dropped out
of the race in October and threw her support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush forces have built a campaign around the county's 64
precincts, with precinct captains in all but a handful.
</P>
<P>
   The captains and a phone bank of local volunteers have made
repeated phone calls to Republicans to gauge the support for Bush,
making sure solid supporters aren't stranded for lack of a ride to
precinct caucuses on Monday. The callers also are cultivating those
leaning toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is locally run, staffed entirely by volunteers,
according to Evan ``Curley'' Hultman, a 74-year-old World War II
veteran and retired Army Reserve major general who is one of the
Bush leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people upstairs with all the money don't
understand,'' Hultman said. ``It's neighbors, neighbors,
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, longtime Republicans say a Forbes victory is not
inconceivable. Forbes has pumped time, energy and money into Iowa
and New Hampshire, where the first primary of the 2000 race will be
held on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign only opened its office downtown this month.
But a paid campaign aide and volunteers are busy organizing turnout
and rides for caucus meetings for those who need them. The
campaign, for instance, arranged for a ride for Slifka's
grandmother to her local caucus site.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has benefited from the support of Leon Moseley, 53, a
Waterloo native and the state's most prominent African-American
Republican. ``I identify with Forbes very much,'' Moseley said in
an interview. ``The only difference between him and me is money.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley works as an industrial engineer at one of Waterloo's
five Deere and Co. installations and has spent a lifetime on
various boards and commissions here, overseeing everything from the
water supply to juvenile justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy that doesn't need to run, and he's running for
only one reason: To put this country back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most of Waterloo's minority community is
backing neither Bush nor Forbes. Because of its history as a
railroad and industrial center, Waterloo has a 12 percent minority
population. That's in a state where African-Americans make up only
1.7 percent of the 2.8 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Gore and Bradley campaigns recognize the
African-American vote as the key to victory in the caucuses and are
working hard to corner it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came to Waterloo a week ago to participate in a Martin
Luther King birthday observance. Talking about his own experiences
witnessing acts of racism, Bradley told an audience of about 100,
``I want you to know that what I see, you feel I can see it and I
know it must end.''
</P>
<P>
   National polls show that Gore has the support of two-thirds of
black voters, and it appears no different in Waterloo. ``He's my
man,'' said the Rev. Wilson Rideout, who at age 81 is the black
community's senior pastor. Rideout said he was impressed with Gore
as vice president and the Clinton administration's record of
appointing blacks to high office.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the Bradley appearance but afterward, ``I never
thought any more about it. I knew who I was supporting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is not taking the African-American vote for
granted here. Through the local ministerial alliance it has
arranged a bus to transport supporters to and from caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
   Unions also are solidly for Gore. The AFL-CIO, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and other
unions have sent full-time paid organizers to Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Iowa Federation of Labor, the state's AFL-CIO
affiliate, union officials have set up phone banks for Gore and
have bankrolled four pro-Gore mailings, the final one last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without organized labor, (a Democrat's) chances of winning are
diminished,'' said Gene Redmon, the poker-faced Iowa federation
district vice president who is heading its operation in Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   His main worry? Workers receiving too many calls from the Gore
campaign and all the unions. Many workers are ambivalent at best
about the political process, he said, turned off by candidates
talking about the booming economy when their pay checks seem
thinner than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see times as being all that good,'' Redmon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has precinct captains in 59 of Black Hawk
county's 64 voting districts. But the major opponent is apathy and
the belief that a Gore victory is inevitable, said John Carson, a
Wisconsin native who interrupted pursuit of a graduate degree in
geography to work here for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the fight with Bradley that's important, it's the
fight to get our people out,'' Carson, 24, said.
</P>
<P>
   That's small comfort to Bradley's supporters, who make up in
enthusiasm what they lack in numbers. ``We basically started from
nothing,'' said E.J. Gallagher, 50, a longtime local Democratic
activist and Bradley supporter. ``The only way we can go is up and
the only way Gore can go is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself has railed against the influence of the vice
president's ``entrenched power'' in terms of getting Democrats to
Monday's caucus meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be awfully difficult to overcome (Gore's
advantages) one person at a time,'' said Bob Fulton, 70, a Bradley
supporter who served as lieutenant governor in the 1960s. ``In
Iowa, organization means everything. If you've got the power
structure of the party, whether Democrat of Republican, your
chances of getting beat are almost nil.''

   Waterloo's five Deere and Co. farm tractor plants represent the
company's largest manufacturing concentration. The IBP Co.'s pork
production plant is one of the largest hog-slaughtering and
processing factories in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the birthplace of the Five Sullivan Brothers, all of
whom were killed while serving on the same naval vessel in the
Pacific during World War II. Their story was turned into a wartime
Hollywood movie that put Waterloo on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Waterloo's fortunes have risen and fallen and risen
again with Iowa's agriculturally based economy. When Iowa went
through its farm crisis of the 1980s, Deere suffered staggering
layoffs and another huge pork plant owned by Rath Co. went belly
up.
</P>
<P>
   Today IBP runs three shifts six days a week. With unemployment
at 2.5 percent, the company has had to recruit workers from Bosnia
and Mexico to fill openings. Deere is selling its farm implements
around the world, including a $90 million deal with the Ukraine two
years ago that included 650 tractors made in Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case in other regions, Waterloo has undergone an
explosion in service industry and health care employment. The
Principal Financial Group, for instance, manages small group
pensions with 300 employees, ``jobs that weren't there 10 years
ago,'' according to Carl Adrian, president of the regional Cedar
Valley Economic Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Times may be good but uncertainty and dissatisfaction still
rule. Deere employed 17,000 workers in the early 1980s; today there
are some 5,000. With 2,100 workers, IPB's starting wage is around
$9 an hour; 18 years ago at the Rath plant, it was $10.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say that with full employment, the attitude of
the people is `fat and happy,''' said Grant Veeder, Waterloo's
auditor and a Black Hawk County Democratic Party official. ``But
that doesn't reflect the reality of the people out there.''

 &HT;    `Marginally identified' Jews targeted for trips
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Jewish community isn't sure it's
going to survive until the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The intermarriage rate between Jews and gentiles in the United
States is approaching 50 percent and only one in 10 of the
grandchildren of these interfaith marriages will consider
themselves Jewish, according to studies. The number of Jewish
children receiving a religious education is half of what it was 30
years ago. Fewer than one in five American Jews can read Hebrew,
less than half belong to a synagogue and, perhaps most critically,
the generation of Jews born after the Holocaust and the
establishment of the State of Israel _ the two seminal Jewish
events of the 20th century _ no longer identify with either event.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the 5.7 million self-identified Jews in
America _ the largest Jewish population in the world _ will have
dwindled to 3 million by the middle of this century and to less
than half that by the century's end.
</P>
<P>
   This projected collapse has U.S. Jewish institutions in a panic.
How do we save our community, they ask each other at meeting after
meeting. How do we ensure Jewish continuity?
</P>
<P>
   The latest strategy? Free trips to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, now the Israeli justice minister, announced
several years ago that the Diaspora had helped Israel long enough.
Now that the state was mature, he said, she should return the favor
and help Jews outside of Israel maintain their sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at the Jerusalem Museum in Israel a year and a half
ago, Michael Steinhardt, a former Wall Street financier, and
Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company, decided to
take Beilin at his word. For the past month, thousands of Jewish
students ages 18 to 26, who had never been to Israel before, were
ferried _ all expenses paid _ on 10-day trips to the Jewish Holy
Land. The aim, according to organizers, was to expose ``marginally
identified'' Jews to Judaism by helping them connect with their
ancestral homeland, heritage and the larger Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish world, as lived in the United States in its
non-Orthodox context, is in decline,'' said Steinhardt, who
contributed $9 million toward the creation of the trip. ``We hope
that this will turn that around.''
</P>
<P>
   BIRTHRIGHT ISRAEL
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Birthright Israel, has drawn sponsorship
from the Israeli government as well as several Jewish philanthropic
organizations. By March, 6,000 Jewish students from both North and
South America _ including about 400 from Florida _ will have flown
to Israel, taken fast-paced tours of the major sites, and returned.
Eventually, organizers hope to send 50,000 young people to Israel
every year and open the program up to high school students.
</P>
<P>
   According to studies, the project may have some merit. Bill
Gralnick, the regional director of The American Jewish Committee, a
social action organization, names six experiences that encourage
young Jews to identify themselves as Jews later in life: attending
Jewish day schools, summer camps and after-school education
programs; belonging to a synagogue; becoming bar or bat mitzvahed;
and traveling to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Five out of six of those experiences are beyond the control of
any organization, Steinhardt said. But creating a free trip to
Israel was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will become a permanent part of Jewish life the
way bar and bat mitzvahs have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, himself an atheist, said he took Beilin's idea to
heart because he feels so strongly about doing what he can to
ensure that the Jewish community survives. It could be argued that
the three most influential people of the century were Jews,
Steinhardt said: Einstein, Freud and Marx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever this magic is that has created such an extraordinary
people, it is our obligation to somehow transmit that to the next
generation, which is so comfortable in America that Judaism has
become an option.''
</P>
<P>
   CASH COULD BE SPENT ELSEWHERE, CRITICS SAY
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the trip have pointed out that while the program
offers an intense Jewish experience to many nonpracticing Jews, it
mandates no follow-up and is open to thousands of students who
could afford to pay for a trip on their own. The money, critics
say, could be more effectively spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Abrams, a spokesperson for the organization, said follow-up
programs are in the works. But in the meantime, the trip is helping
to build a sense of Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing now is that they made new friends
that were like themselves and they want to keep in touch with
them,'' Abrams said. ``That is the true goal of the program, to
connect with other Jews there and then to bring that back home.''
(Abrams said at least one couple _ who knew each other before they
went on the trip _ got engaged. ``Yeah, sure, we're hoping they'll
be more (engagements),'' Abrams said. ``That would be nice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gralnick said the long-term impact Birthright Israel will have
on younger Jews remains to be seen, but ``it's like chicken soup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, it can't hurt.''

 &HT;    Floridian's visit to Jewish relatives a transforming event
 &HT;    By David Naiman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ David Naiman, 25, of West Palm Beach, is
a senior studying physical therapy at South College. He heard about
Birthright Israel, a program offering trips to Israel, though a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   DEC. 31, 1999
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish people engaged in a mass suicide here at Masada due
to the fact that a Roman takeover was seemingly inevitable. That
people could feel such a loyalty and devotion to not only their
religion but to their way of being is a concept that I could only
hope to grasp ... I think that if I was put in such a situation I
would choose my life and the existence of my family and friends
over the continued practice of my religion and culture. The fact
that my immediate family network means that much to me made me
realize that I am more a product of my culture than I ever thought.
JAN. 3, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Although I realize that the Golan was rightfully acquired by
Israel in warfare, I also sense that the true ownership of the land
rests with the Syrians. The land belonged to the Syrians throughout
history. They had established a culture and society just as the
Israelis had done with much of their land. The circumstances
surrounding the acquisition of this territory should possibly give
the Israelis a greater sense of empathy
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 4
</P>
<P>
   What struck me the most about the Wailing Wall were the cries
and the sobs, manifestations of profound feelings of loss and
distress. I was surrounded by friends who were in sync with the
deep emotion that was seemingly protruding from the wall. But such
feelings could not be elicited in me. I do not know why.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 12
</P>
<P>
   Naiman immigrated to the United States from St. Petersburg,
Russia, when he was less than a year old. After the Birthright
Israel program ended, he traveled to Tel Aviv and Haifa to visit
family he had never met.
</P>
<P>
   What an awesome trip. The sights I saw and the feelings I felt
were unlike anything I have experienced in my life. I know that I
have grown not only in character but in spirit as well. Being a
resourceful person I was able to locate various family members that
had lived here for years. I have not traveled to many places so I
never knew what it was like to feel distanced from home. When I
arrived at my cousin's home in Israel for the first time in my life
I felt that I had arrived home, to a place that had been missing in
my life. It was as familiar as walking into one's kitchen after
school and grabbing a bite to eat from the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   My relatives and I talked for hours, piecing together the
history and the missing links of our family. For the first time I
felt a sense of continuity in my life, as if I belong to an
extremely important chain in the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget what meeting these people has meant to me,
and throughout the rest of my life I will try to maintain a
relationship with them.

 &HT;    Trip inspires new connection to Jewish faith
 &HT;    By Lauren Yeckes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lauren Yeckes, 20, of Palm Beach
Gardens, is a junior at the University of Florida majoring in
criminal psychology. She went on Birthright Israel along with about
400 students from Florida on December 29 and returned on January 7.
She kept a diary, excerpted here, for The Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   DEC. 29, 1999
</P>
<P>
   It's 11 p.m. Florida time and I have been in an airplane for
five hours, six more to go. We had a two-hour delay at Miami
International Airport due to security threats. Once we were all on
the plane they made us get off and be searched by dogs. What a
pleasant way to begin my journey out of the only world I've ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   I feel like I am in a huge warp zone. I am on this plane filled
with a bunch of drunk college students who cannot manage to read
the ``Fasten Your Seat Belts'' sign. For as far as I can see the
aisles converge with crowds of people who can barely stand up, let
alone if there's heavy turbulence. Forget about time, forget about
sleep, forget about privacy. I can't wait to get there.
</P>
<P>
   DEC. 31, 1999, IN JERUSALEM
</P>
<P>
   Today was a blast. We woke up at 5 a.m. to eat an early
breakfast and then we were off to Masada! (Masada is a massive
natural stronghold atop a mountain in the Negev Desert near the
Dead Sea where a group of Jewish zealots committed mass suicide in
A.D. 73 rather than submit to the Romans). It took about an hour to
climb, stopping along the way several times to drink water _ and
for some to throw up. When we got to the top, each bus group broke
into groups. Our guide gave an amazing explanation of the history
of the mass suicide at Masada. Then we descended by cable car and
headed to the falls at Ein Gedi. We hiked up a smaller mountain of
dry gravel, then we came to this beautiful waterfall. It was so
amazing! All this desert and a waterfall 50 feet tall in the middle
of nowhere. I have never seen an oasis before. The trail along the
way was nice too, but very muddy and slippery. Also, I have yet to
see live animals in Israel. So far there has been nothing but
desert.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 1, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Last night was New Year's Eve! We had a dessert buffet at the
hotel followed by the most incredible New Year's celebration I have
ever had! I was hesitant to come on this trip because I didn't want
to miss out on the new millennium in the U.S., but now I feel
differently. I will always remember for the rest of my life that I
was in Israel at the turn of the century, in a gathering of young
Jews. I felt so much at home. The countdown was in Hebrew and then
I was drenched in champagne, confetti and kisses. It was this night
that made me realize something: Earlier at dinner, guest speaker
Mr. Avram Infeld, director of the Melitz Institute, expressed that
Judaism is not a religion, but rather a people. Tonight I was a
part of that and now I wouldn't take that back for anything in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, since it was Shabbat we weren't supposed to drive
anywhere, so we went into the desert behind our hotel. It was so
beautiful and there were little trails of water running through
rocks. Our bus (there are 39 of us) gathered on a pile of rocks and
had a spiritual conversation. Then we stood in front of the group
one at at time and talked about our Hebrew names and heritage. I
was given my Hebrew name after my great-grandmother on my dad's
side (Tzeporah).
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening we went to a Bedouin village for a desert
dinner extravaganza. Upon arrival some us rode camels around a
campfire while others tasted different appetizers. I was out in the
middle of nowhere in the desert with so many new friends. We were
all sharing this experience together. We all sat down (about 400 of
us) on these long mats that were facing each other and we were
served the huge trays of Bedouin-style food. At this point I am
getting to know more people, and faces are becoming more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 2
</P>
<P>
   Today was filled with too many speakers. I'd say about half of
us fell asleep for most of this day. I am being serious when I say
that I met so many people simply by waking up on their shoulder
after a long speech on politics that does not really interest me.
For dinner we went to an army base and ate with the IDF soldiers.
The girls went crazy. It was weird how some of them were younger
than us, yet they seemed so mature. As they sat down at the able to
eat they had to be careful not to knock anyone out with their
automatic weapons. I would like to add at this point that not once
so far have I felt threatened in any way as far as safety is
concerned. This place is safer than my own neighborhood back home.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 3
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is sick, coughing, sneezing, sore throats, etc. We rode
for an hour along the Israel/Lebanon border. We rode through the
battlefield of the 1973 War. We saw old bunkers and cars. We
learned all about the Golan Heights and how there has been a battle
for peace over this land between Syria and Israel. Personally, I
feel that we (Israel) should struggle to keep the Golan Heights as
we have for years.
</P>
<P>
   Right now we are (on the bus) leaving a Jewish National Fund
forest where each one of us planted a tree. This only took about 20
minutes but the experience was so amazing. I planted my tree with
my friend David Naiman, whom I met through this trip. Everything
hit me at once. This whole trip was given to me as a gift and I
felt that in some small way I was giving back. Afterward I stood on
top of a big rock and watched as hundreds of others my age began to
rebuild Israel. And then I realized: We, too, are the seeds that
can bring life back to Israel. Our generation can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 5
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the day was visiting the Western Wall. I've
seen it in pictures, but seeing it from a distance for the first
time was overwhelming. The line to go through security took
forever, but soon we separated, the guys went to one side and the
girls went to the other. It was emotional for me because I had my
family and friends give me messages to put in the wall. I felt like
a messenger, in a way, and that I was doing a good deed (mitzvah)
by delivering their messages. I was saying my prayers, and when I
was done, for some reason, I looked up towards the sky and what I
saw was breathtaking. Out of the wall (made completely of
limestone) grew a small plant just above my head with a few leaves
and branches. Attached to one of the branches was red string, which
was tied perfectly around a paper message. It hung there and blew
in the wind and it was so beautiful. The only part of the wall that
is alive is carrying a message to God. This has been one of my
favorite moments so far.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 6
</P>
<P>
   Tonight we visited the place in Tel Aviv where Rabin was
assassinated. We saw the huge memorial and each bus lit a candle. I
said my prayer and then I went with some friends from bus No. 3
around Tel Aviv for a free night around the city. I walked around
with Ryan Brill from FIU in Miami, his two brothers, Mark and
Kevin, and their friend Ze'ev, who lives in Israel. Ze'ev showed us
around like he was our tour guide. We went to the beach and then to
this famous juice bar right on the beach. I had such a great time
hanging out with Ryan. In such a short time I noticed we had very
similar values and interests. We also feel very connected to
Judaism, which means a lot to me. I rode his bus back to Jerusalem
and for that hour we have a nice, long talk.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 9
</P>
<P>
   I came on this trip for my own reasons. I wanted to be bold and
take a risk. I left my whole life behind to go to another world
with total strangers. But in five minutes we weren't strangers
anymore. We were united. And from that point on I felt comfortable
opening myself up to the people around me, creating some of the
best friendships. We were all sad to leave Israel, but mostly to
leave each other. We met so many people from other schools. I am
going to keep in touch with my roommates, some other friends that I
met on the trip and, of course, with Ryan, who made my experience
so much more memorable.

<P>
   Huizenga landed on the team's practice fields, then joined new
Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt in trying to persuade Donahoe _ who
was forced to resign as Pittsburgh Steelers' director of football
operations after a rift developed with head coach Bill Cowher _ to
take a new front-office position with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's a competitor,'' Wannstedt said. ``He's not going to
let anybody get an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Huizenga didn't prompt Donahoe, 52, to make a decision
_ he plans to talk to the Saints and Patriots again _ he made an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awful nice of him to do that,'' Donahoe said. ``I'm
sure he's got more important things to do than to talk to me ...
For a man of his reputation and how busy he is, it meant a lot to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wannstedt's search for an offensive coordinator
became a little clearer. One candidate seems to be out of the
picture. Kansas City quarterbacks coach Tom Rossley, who had yet to
interview in Miami, appears to be headed for Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt's next interview for that job will be Monday, when
former Dallas coach Chan Gailey comes to town. Indianapolis
quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians met with Wannstedt on Wednesday.
Washington quarterbacks coach Rich Olson also could be added to the
list.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Wannstedt concentrated on trying to hire Donahoe,
who had been with the Steelers for 14 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back over the years, the Steelers have drafted as
well as anybody,'' Wannstedt said. ``The biggest problem they've
had is not being able to keep their free agents. Who's making the
decisions as far as money, I don't know. But as far as getting
players, being thorough, being able to work with people in the
organization, Tom Donahoe is as good as the top group out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt and Donahoe, both Pittsburgh natives, have developed a
friendship during their careers. Two years ago, the two were in
Dublin, Ireland, for an exhibition between the Steelers and Bears,
then coached by Wannstedt, when a photo ran in a newspaper of
Wannstedt golfing at a local course. Donahue asked to have a copy
of the photo enlarged, then framed it and gave it to Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a fabulous coach and an even better person,''
Donahoe said. ``The Dolphins are lucky to have him as their head
football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dolphins are offering Donahoe a high-level job _
overseeing both the college and pro personnel departments _ he
would not be the team's general manager. That role disappeared when
Jimmy Johnson resigned Sunday. And although Wannstedt doesn't have
the title, his contract does include a clause that says he has
final personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If he went to New England, Donahoe could end up in a similar
situation. The Patriots are expected to offer Bill Belichick a job
as coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, however, are prepared to throw everything _ money
and power _ at Donahoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power doesn't mean anything to me,'' Donahue insisted Thursday
after meeting with Huizenga, Wannstedt, team president Eddie Jones
and director of football operations Bob Ackles. ``Titles really
don't mean anything to me. I'm concerned with winning. That's what
I think I've been all about. If I go somewhere, I just want to feel
I can make a contribution to a winning effort. Whoever gets credit,
it doesn't phase me.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Saints seem to fail the can-they-win test.
After trading away their entire draft for the chance to select
running back Ricky Williams, they finished 3-13 in 1999. Still,
Donahoe isn't ruling them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a team may not be in the position of winning
tomorrow, there still may be a commitment there to put the thing
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another possibility. Donahoe could pass on all NFL job
offers. He still has one year remaining _ worth about $500,000 _ on
his three-year deal with the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue admits that his ties to Pittsburgh will make it hard for
him to leave. Two years ago, he turned down a multimillion-dollar
deal to work for the Seahawks, saying he preferred to stay in his
hometown. This time, however, he seems ready to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is home, but I've talked to family about it, and we realize
that if we're going to stay in the NFL we will have to move,'' he
said. ``And they're fine with that.''

AUTO DESIGN: MEDIEVAL TECH: SHOW CARS IN SHINING ARMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PHIL PATTON DETROIT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the seasonal introductions of the latest fashions in New
York and Milan, auto shows give designers a chance to parade their
visions before their peers and the public. In either venue, the
stars are one-off models _ couture that is later translated into
pret-a-porter for the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   At auto shows this month in Los Angeles and Detroit, the techno
look is this year's dominant design theme. Techno is the term that
many designers use for a tough, machinelike style with boldly
flaunted screwheads, heroic hinges and handles and prominent panels
of metal, either solid or mesh.
</P>
<P>
   The most common color of show cars this year is not sporty red
or domestic green, but silver _ the silver of raw, machined metal,
die-cast or forged, brushed and buffed. Everywhere the emphasis is
on machined pieces that are joined together rather than on unified
shapes with flowing lines. The shows offer a vision of the
automobile that differs from metaphors of the past _ the car as
airplane, for instance. This is the year of the car as a piece of
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Designers these days seem interested in making vehicles look
like the sports equipment they show strapped on and packed inside _
all those mountain bikes and snowboards, kayaks and backpacks used
by customers with the ``active lifestyles'' that manufacturers are
obsessed with. To hold all that gear, the show cars offer roof
racks, removable coolers and cargo drawers. Storage abounds; the
theme is lock-and-load.
</P>
<P>
   Techno can even make the rugged appear elegant, as with
Volkswagen's beefy pickup truck concept, the Advanced Activity
Concept shown in Detroit, and its off-road New Beetle, the Dune, in
Los Angeles. Aluminum panels are used like armor to make the
vehicles seem extra tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tech at the shows,'' said J. Mays, vice
president for design at Ford, ``a lot of over-the-top Teutonic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the Terradyne,'' he added, referring to a huge diesel
pickup from his competitors at General Motors' GMC division. The
Terradyne, with its bulldog face, exposed wheel wells and metal
cladding, could have emerged from the film ``Iron Giant.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Close by stood some techno kin, including the Hummer H2, a
smaller but no less aggressive version of the vehicle originally
designed for the military. GM acquired rights to the Hummer last
year from AM General.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Isuzu accompanied its swoopy, sci-fi VehiCross
with two concepts for future sport utility vehicles, the ZXS and
Kai, all metallic arcs and angles.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had a rugged pickup, the Dodge Maxxcab, as
aggressive as the huge ram on its grille; the truck would look at
home in the post-apocalyptic ``Mad Max'' films.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Mays showed his Desert Excursion, a concept for
a macho SUV, and in Detroit he had the Equator, a futuristic
four-door pickup with lower panels of Kevlar, the material in
bulletproof vests. Surveying the abundance of hard-faced vehicles
on the show floor, he said, ``Now, I think I'm going to stop doing
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   As if anticipating this year's design trend, BMW held a dinner
for the press at the Detroit Institute of Arts, in an entry hall
lined with medieval and Renaissance armor. The show's themes were
all there: the articulated shoulder and breast plates, the bold
rivet heads, the mesh faceplates and helmets. The high technology
of the 16th century had foreshadowed that of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on nuts and bolts and armored plate suggests an
industry driving into a combative, fearful new world. As if girding
against road rage, the new show cars wrap themselves in bars and
grids and meshes; taillights and headlights peer out like
crossbowmen from slits in castle walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is everyone in Detroit afraid of? Last year set sales
records. But uncertainty lies ahead. New technologies, from the
Internet to fuel cells, make the industry nervous. So does a new
generation of buyers, the maturing ``echo boomers'' about whose
tastes Detroit is uncertain. Perhaps paramount is the difficulty of
figuring out a suitable look for crossover vehicles that combine
features of truck, car and sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Technological changes are inspiring esthetic changes, too. Some
techno designs are about real technology, like Ford's Prodigy and
GM's Precept, two hybrid-powered cars that have both
internal-combustion and electric systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Think city, a small electric coupe from Ford, looks forward,
as does the Think neighbor community car, essentially a futuristic
golf cart by Dan Sturgis and Mark Johnson of frogdesign, the
prestigious design firm whose clients have included Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Other visions look back to go forward, including the Chevrolet
Super Sport Roadster, a small rear-drive pickup with coupelike
lines and a V8 engine. It manages to combine tech with retro,
merging the nose of a 1940's pickup with the lines of an El Camino,
the half-car, half-truck centaur that spent two decades in Chevy's
lineup. A sliding cover tops the SSR's bed and the cab's top
retracts to make a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Zarrella, president of GM North America, said the SSR was
likely to be produced within two years. But it is a far less
sophisticated concept than last year's lovely Nomad wagon, which
the company's vice president for design, Wayne Cherry, said he was
still pushing for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the parts add up to less than a unified whole. Last
year in Detroit, the Pontiac Aztek was only a concept car; now it
is here as a production model, little changed. Promoted as a
``sports recreation vehicle'' _ part van, part SUV, part sport
sedan _ it offers a new package whose wrapping is not entirely
successful. The Aztek's rendition of Pontiac's traditional split
grille and horizontally split hood give its face an aggressive,
hungry, snoutish quality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even sports car concepts show techno influences. For the
Mercedes-Benz Vision SLA, a small roadster, the theme is thick
metal punched with portholes. Exposed shock-absorber towers
protrude from the hood like gun emplacements; a huge beak swoops
down a panel of perforated aluminum like the face of a knight's
helmet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tech infiltrated the new car that Mays called his favorite, the
F-Type concept by Jaguar, Ford's premium subsidiary. A flowing
shape evoking the classic E-Type, it is rendered in the ubiquitous
silver with a barely discernible crease around its waist. The
F-Type will almost certainly go into production in two or three
years to give Jaguar a smaller, less expensive car to compete with
the BMW Z3 and Porsche Boxster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The F-Type also pleased the Boxster's designer, Grant Larson, a
young Minnesotan who works for Porsche in Germany. ``It has to be
refined,'' he said, ``but it's impressive.'' Even in this sleek
evocation of a classic sports car, however, techno intrudes. Lining
the F-Type's oval grill is rugged metal mesh, like chain mail _ a
bit of Olde English amid Cool Britannia. &QL;

 &HT;    N.C. CONGRESS MEMBERS ASK CLINTON FOR GREATER FLOOD RELIEF
 &HT;    Eds: Changes in first 4 grafs with 2nd letter.
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Carolina's congressional delegation sent
President Clinton two letters Friday asking that victims of last
year's Hurricane Floyd receive additional aid quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically, your inclusion of additional Hurricane Floyd
relief in an early emergency supplement request is critical to
meeting the most pressing needs of suffering US. citizens in areas
such as housing, agriculture and aid to coastal communities,'' said
one letter, sent to Clinton, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by all 12 of the state's House members, comes
just before the second session of the 106th Congress convenes
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., also sent a letter to the president
late Friday afternoon asking for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five months after Hurricane Floyd devastated the eastern half
of North Carolina, life is still anything but normal,'' Edwards
wrote. ``Thousands of people still remain in temporary trailers and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster hotline still logs
more than 100 phone calls a day.''
</P>
<P>
   A planned supplemental funding package for U.S. operations in
Kosovo is seen as a good candidate for the flood aid. Funds in a
supplemental budget bill for the current fiscal year could be sent
to the state as early as June, some on Capitol Hill believe.
</P>
<P>
   The letters mark a renewal of efforts by state officials to win
substantial federal housing and farm assistance. Despite vigorous
lobbying of Congress and the White House last year, including seven
visits to the capital by Gov. Jim Hunt, many officials were
disappointed by the $2.2 billion in aid finally approved. The state
General Assembly later approved $836 million in relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``came down here and felt everybody's pain, but nothing
came later,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's letters request no specific amount of aid. That will
come after Hunt's office finishes its analysis of the state's unmet
relief needs.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies are still tallying program needs, but should have
a figure ready by the first week of February, said Robert Carver of
the North Carolina Hurricane Floyd Redevelopment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is especially needed for long-term replacement housing
and the replacement of farm equipment and to prepare farmers for
the upcoming growing season,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.
``Agriculture is still the economic engine of eastern North
Carolina, and that is what makes the economic disaster so much
worse. It came on the heels of an already disastrous growing season
and several years of poor prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Edwards said they expect Clinton will ask for the
money, but the representatives are not solely banking on that
request.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said she used the nine-week winter
break to talk with representatives from other states hard hit by
Hurricane Floyd to support a special relief program.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina was the state most severely hurt, but others
suffered as well,'' Clayton said. ``I think we'll have more
(representatives) than North Carolina carrying the banner this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said Republican leaders have indicated to her that they
did perceive the needs as pressing and wanted to wait for Clinton's
supplemental funding request.
</P>
<P>
   A separate program with support in the Senate is an $81 million
program to provide debt relief to tobacco, cotton and peanut
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The money was part of the fiscal 2000 budget approved by the
Senate last fall but removed in final negotiations with the House
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have assured Edwards that the money will be
included in the Senate's first appropriation bill, said Edwards
spokesman Michael Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers are still suffering from substantial crop
losses,'' Edwards writes. ``If more help does not come soon, some
farmers will simply have to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's budget maneuvering stung the North Carolina
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed our (GOP) leadership didn't understand the
dire need of our farmers,'' Jones said. However, Jones said he
understood Hastert's worries that reopening budget discussions for
the agricultural money may have prompted a flood of special
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm right in saying this, but the leadership has gotten
a better idea of the devastation,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that while he wants Clinton to ask for supplemental
flood relief, he hopes it is not linked to funding for Kosovo or
another foreign aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my five years I have not voted for a foreign aid package,''
Jones said. ``But to help the people of eastern North Carolina I
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ``We really felt as the session wound down we started
behind the eight ball,'' Etheridge said. ``Members were so
distracted with, number one, trying to get the budget through and,
number two, trying to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, Etheridge and Jones agree the problems eastern North
Carolina faces cannot be solved with a single appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take years to get back on their feet,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond funding the immediate relief needs, Jones and Clayton
said the delegation needs to pursue money for long-term recovery
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said she wants Congress to establish a commission to
study what investments are needed to turn eastern North Carolina
into ``an economically viable region'' and to look at the region's
unmet housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government can't do it alone. but because of the
demographics, this area needs more help in securing affordable
housing and repairing and improving its infrastructure,'' she said.
``My dream is to turn this disaster into an opportunity and that
there is a redeeming grace out of all this suffering,'' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge said such a study could lay the groundwork for
providing better assistance to states in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The betting had been on the voices, a trifecta of
soprano thoroughbreds that could not miss. At the finish line _
certainly one of the most beautiful ever devised _ there they were,
neck and neck: Renee Fleming as the Marschallin, Susan Graham as
Octavian and Heidi Grant Murphy as Sophie singing the trio that has
broken the hearts of opera lovers for almost a century.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, of course, was ``Der Rosenkavalier'' by Richard
Strauss, not his last paean to the female voice but perhaps his
truest. Although the Metropolitan Opera's production is 30 years
old, the summoning of this much singing talent to one stage had
something fresh about it on Thursday night. The voices were pretty
much what our operatic racing forms had touted them to be, but
voices were not the substance of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of disbelief is the usual evening's work at the opera
house. Ticket buyers faced with the overweight soprano, the aged
tenor or the incredible plot treat such inconveniences as a kind of
surcharge: any fee will be paid to get to the melting sound, the
tenorial throb or the languid melodic line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' with a libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal
as real, as subtle and as touching as its music, suffers sorely
from such transactions. The opera's intersection of young love and
fading beauty has a humanity that demands credibility. The Three
Sopranos may inhabit a Viennese palace, but their progress is
guided by irreducible facts of life that touch anyone who has loved
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   These elements formed the background of Thursday's impressive
success. For here we could look up to the stage and see without
fear of compromise the people Hofmannsthal might himself have
imagined. The three voices _ each one of high quality _ were also
very different in timbre and size; and just as Ms. Graham looked
the perfect Octavian, so her clear, assertive voice sounded like
him too. Equally successful was Ms. Fleming, a Marschallin who
finds the languid desperation that lies behind the frenetic
goings-on of Act I.
</P>
<P>
   The splendidly calculated and yet very natural interaction
between Ms. Fleming and Ms. Graham must have come as much from
previous collaborations in other opera houses as from Bruce
Donnell, the stage director for this revival. I thought the
physical comedy of Acts II and III degenerated too often into
slapstick, but whatever contribution Donnell made to the exquisite
timing in the love scenes deserves credit. Ms. Fleming sang not
just beautifully but touchingly. I had a little trouble hearing her
in Act I, the impression being not necessarily of a voice too small
but of a stage too big. Gradually the acuteness of her portrayal
drew one closer, and her vocal presence at the end was large.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy's Sophie is long on rambuctiousness and a little
short on tender femininity, but when she sang those pure, reedy
pianissimos, the ear was supplied with qualities the eye might have
been denied. Franz Hawlata was the unusually svelte Baron Ochs;
otherwise his performance followed soundly in the tradition of
Ochses before him. Hans-Joachim Ketelsen (Faninal), Wendy White
(Annina), Anthony Laciura (Valzacchi) and Julia Faulkner (Marianne)
were all strong performers.
</P>
<P>
   The production by Nathaniel Merrill and Robert O'Hearn has aged
gracefully and retains its sense of grandness. One tires of having
to find new ways to say how well the Met Orchestra plays for James
Levine, but one does not tire of listening to them. Strauss'
exquisite, lapidary orchestra writing is what these players and
their conductor manage better than almost anyone.

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ When Dr. Carl Chen arrived in Southern
California from Taiwan with $300 in his pocket, he looked skyward
for opportunity. The year was 1968, and the region around Los
Angeles was the uncontested world center of the burgeoning
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the industry is a shadow of its former
self, with many of the most important companies from those days
merged, moved or shrunk beyond recognition. Yet Chen, and a small
band of entrepreneurs like him, believe there remains a bright
future here in developing new and innovative aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be sort of childish to think this, but I think
there's still a big opportunity in this business,'' said Chen,
whose company, Advanced Aerodynamics and Structures, is working on
a new line of small propjets in a 200,000-square-foot plant in this
city. ``Everybody else goes to a dot-com, but we are stupid enough
to think that you can still make money making something.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced, which says it has a $220 million backlog of orders for
182 of its new Jetcruzer corporate aircraft, exemplifies a new
breed of aerospace manufacturers, hardened by bitter experience,
that has emerged from the devastating downturn in Southern
California aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the industry, once dominated by military and space
contractors, has shed nearly 20,000 jobs in the region, and many of
the flagship companies have migrated away or been acquired by
companies based elsewhere, including Lockheed, Douglas Aircraft,
Convair, and Hughes Aircraft, where Chen, who has a PhD in
engineering from the California Institute of Technology, once
worked as a leading researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace companies have also reduced employment in other
regions, but the hemorrhaging was particularly severe in Southern
California, which once dominated the business, not only nationally
but in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the region lost roughly one-fifth of its
aerospace jobs, while the average elsewhere was just 3 percent.
Now, for the first time in decades, Southern California is no
longer the largest region for aerospace; it has been eclipsed by
Seattle, home of Boeing, which acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sedlik, manager of economic and business development at
Southern California Edison, the region's biggest privately owned
electric utility, traces this collapse to a host of factors,
including a widespread perception that living and doing business in
the region is very expensive, which helps explain why many
corporate headquarters have shifted to other regions after mergers
and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these firms moved, there weren't the allegiances that
used to be there,'' Sedlik said.
</P>
<P>
   Sedlik also credits effective ``pork barrel'' maneuvering by
legislators from Georgia, Texas and other states, steering
contracts to their districts and away from California. He said
government procurement rules that stressed factors like local wages
and cost of living tended to drive work elsewhere while more
nuanced economic advantages, like the presence of a large skilled
work force and easy access to suppliers, tended to be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has had a particularly harsh impact on the region's
20,000-odd smaller subcontractors, who account for the bulk of
aerospace employment in the area. Many of these dozen-employee,
million-dollar-a-year shops, long the heart and soul of the local
industry, are being left behind by the few remaining prime
contractors, whose escalating technological requirements and ever
tougher price and delivery demands put even more subcontracting
work beyond the small shops' reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape has changed,'' said David Goodreau, president of
Quantum Manufacturing, a Burbank-based aerospace machine shop whose
roots in the field date to before World War II. ``The bigger
companies can buy the equipment to meet the cost requirements of
the primes. They can do the work of 10 of my shops.'' Quantum's
payroll has dwindled to five workers in the last few years from 17.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, the best entrepreneurial
opportunities now may lie not in doing specialty work for the
giants, but instead in developing new technology, as Advanced is
doing. Some companies, like tiny Dyna-Cam Industries, are
attempting this on little more than sweat and optimism. For more
than 10 years, Dyna-Cam has been working on a high-efficiency new
engine that may find uses in boats, aircraft and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Limping along on slightly more than $1 million invested by the
founder, a former real estate agent named Pat Wilks, or borrowed
from investors and the Small Business Administration, Dyna-Cam says
it has orders for 50 of its new engines but not enough capital to
begin full-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what's going to happen,'' said Ms. Wilks, whose
father and brother are engine designers. ``If we don't get more
investment, we'll be in trouble soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital does not seem to be much of a problem for Advanced
Aerospace. Begun with a $20 million investment from a Taiwanese
businessman, the company went public in December 1996, raising
enough money to finish developing the Jetcruzer. The company has
tapped deeply into the region's reservoir of skilled workers,
employing engineers with experience on projects like Lockheed
Martin's F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, the B-2 Spirit stealth
bomber from Northrop Grumman and the McDonnell Douglas MD-ll
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetcruzer makes use of innovations like a graphite composite
skin and a very fuel-efficient engine. Unlike many aircraft its
size, the Jetcruzer can carry passengers from New York to Los
Angeles with only one stop. Its six-seat cabin was developed by
designers from BMW's Southern California design studio, and is
intended to appeal to younger executives and entrepreneurs whose
success in the Internet economy put them into the target market for
a business jet with a $1.5 million price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced expects to finish testing the aircraft by spring, and
then submit it to the Federal Aviation Administration for safety
approval. If all goes well, the company will have the Jetcruzer in
full production by the end of the year, expanding its payroll to
300 from 100 today.
</P>
<P>
   Given the still prodigious number of unemployed or underemployed
skilled aerospace workers in the region, Chen expects little
trouble staffing his plant. He already has 2,000 job applications
on file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a lot of ups and downs in this business, and a
lot of good people let go,'' Chen said, ``but that has worked out
for us. Everyone thinks this industry is wrong, but we believe we
have turned out to be in the right place at precisely the right
time.''

DAILY NEWS CRITICS GET A GOLDEN GLOBE-LIKE HANDLE ON THE OSCAR
RACE

A conversation with BOB STRAUSS AND GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday's Golden Globe ceremonies kick off that two-month orgy of
self-congratulation, misplaced enthusiasm and unseemly pleading
otherwise known as movie awards season.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the 72nd Academy Awards presentation on March
26, not-so-small armies of lobbyist and publicists will be making
uncountable calls and buying oodles of trade ads to convince
industry types that their version of ``This Prisoner Is Innocent''
or ``My Miserable Irish Youth'' was 1999's pinnacle of film art.
</P>
<P>
   The politicking should be especially fevered this year, since no
film or two dominated the year-end critics' choices and there is an
unusually wide field of estimable contenders to pick from. Your
usually self-assured _ and sometimes even right _ Daily News
prognosticators Bob Strauss and Glenn Whipp admit that they, like
everyone else, are essentially stumped at this point. But that, of
course, won't stop them from opining about what they think will _
or should _ be nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   You can judge their psychic abilities for yourself when Academy
Award nominations are announced in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 15. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Theoretically, I like the idea that there are few Oscar
front-runners this year, but the fact that there was so much good
work of fairly equivalent value also makes the idea of choosing a
single best artistic endeavor seem even more dubious than it
usually does.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Yes, especially when our two favorite movies from the
past year _ ``The Straight Story'' and ``Magnolia'' _ don't stand a
snowball's chance in hell of making the final cut for best picture.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Now now, no need to be bitter. There are plenty of
really fine films in the running. ``American Beauty,'' ``The
Insider'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' all have their flaws, but
overall they're exceptionally intelligent and cinematically astute
movies, and they're all pretty likely best picture nominees. I also
think that ``Topsy-Turvy,'' ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Three
Kings,'' and maybe even ``All About My Mother'' and ``Toy Story 2''
have outside but real chances to run the big race.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Well, as much as I loved ``Three Kings,'' ``Malkovich''
and ``Toy Story 2,'' I can't see them winding up as best picture
nominees. And ``All About My Mother'' and ``Topsy-Turvy'' are too
arty for the Academy's mainstream leanings.
</P>
<P>
   All of them would certainly be better choices, however, than
either ``The Hurricane'' or ``The Green Mile,'' two Important
Movies that seem to have been specifically geared toward Oscar
voters. Same for ``The Cider House Rules,'' a minor movie that
Miramax is trying to shove down people's throats as a work of art.
If Miramax's Oscar campaign for this film wins it a passel of
nominations, they should just call off next year's ceremonies right
now and give the best picture award to the studio that ponies up
the most money.
</P>
<P>
   Oh wait ... that's what they did last year. How quickly we
forget.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Yeah, except ``Shakespeare in Love'' was actually
clever. Plus, it was all about putting on a show, a subject academy
members understandably hold dear and which, I think, makes the
late-blooming critics' darling ``Topsy-Turvy'' the most likely
``surprise'' contender.
</P>
<P>
   But on to more predictable matters. I've got to say _ and it's
probably the only time I'll ever agree with that bunch in this or
any century _ that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association got the
actor field as right as it possibly could with its dramatic picture
Globe nominations. ``The Insider's'' Russell Crowe, ``Ripley's''
Matt Damon, ``Striaght's'' Richard Farnsworth, ``Beauty's'' Kevin
Spacey and ``Hurricane's'' Denzel Washington should not only turn
out to be the academy nominees, they gave my favorite lead
performances of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Well, them and ``Topsy's'' Jim Broadbent. And that spooky kid in
``The Sixth Sense,'' but they're wrongheadedly pushing him in the
more crowded supporting actor category.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: It is a more crowded category, although the ``kid'' (and
let's give the tyke a little credit and call him by his full name,
Haley Joel Osment) probably stands a better chance in winning the
supporting actor award.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, Spacey, Washington and Farnsworth have all taken critics
prizes, and Sunday's Globes and the upcoming SAG awards will give
us an idea of who the front-runner truly is. Farnsworth is the most
deserving, but Washington probably has the most support. The
academy could certainly do worse, i.e. Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   No such dilemma presents itself in the actress category, where
it's Hilary Swank and ... well, Hilary Swank. She has won every
award thus far. But then, not everyone has seen her boyish turn in
``Boys Don't Cry,'' which could bode well for Annette Bening, even
though she's probably the least of ``American Beauty's'' fine
ensemble. It just highlights what a weak category this is. There
will be none of those silly ``year of the woman'' pronouncements
this year.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Speaking of silly, I'm afraid the limited field means
we're going to see a Janet McTeer nomination. The ``Tumbleweeds''
star is perfectly suited for the traditional overacting Brit slot
that's accommodated Brenda Blethyn, Julie Walters and Pauline
Collins in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On a more ambivalent note, I'd love to see the always-deserving
Julianne Moore compete in the big contest. Unfortunately, she only
qualifies for one of her five 1999 films, ``The End of the Affair''
_ which, though another best picture possibility, was much too
timid in addressing the tough spiritual themes of Graham Greene's
blistering novel. Other than that, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep,
Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder and Reese Witherspoon could all
conceivably make the cut, but yeah, it doesn't matter; Swank looks
like the safest Oscar bet of the season. The role gave her a lot to
work with, and she achieved practically all of its great potential.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Well ... yes. But, I would hasten to add Cecilia Roth's
deeply moving turn in ``All About My Mother'' to any list of worthy
performances. She's every bit as good as Swank, and in many
respects, she pulls off a more profound accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to look so hard to find worthy nominees for
supporting actress. ``Boys'' co-star Chloe Sevigny deserves just as
much acclaim as Swank, while Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz made
``Malkovich's'' identity crises so much fun to watch. Then add two
disparate turns: Angelina Jolie's seductive wild child in ``Girl,
Interrupted'' and Samantha Morton's mute moll in ``Sweet and
Lowdown,'' and you have a group that positively dwarfs those in the
actress category.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I'd like to see Moore for either ``Magnolia'' or ``An
Ideal Husband,'' and ``Sixth Sense's'' Toni Collette will get votes
just for playing Spooky's mom, but that pretty much covers it. From
those slim pickings, though, we go to overflowing volume in the
supporting actor category. We can probably each pick five decent
candidates who have a good chance and still have big ol' Michael
Clarke Duncan from ``The Green Mile'' left over.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, let's do it. I'll go with, in descending but close
order, ``Magnolia's'' Tom Cruise, ``Beauty's'' Wes Bentley,
``Insider's'' Christopher Plummer and ``Cider House's'' Michael
Caine. ``Three Kings''' Said Taghmaoui may be a little obscure for
my fifth choice, but the way he humanized that Iraqi torturer was
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: OK. I'll pick Eddie Murphy, so good in his dual roles in
``Bowfinger,'' followed by Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman from
``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (although you could just as easily
nominate Hoffman for his work in ``Magnolia'' too), the previously
mentioned Osment and, of course, John Malkovich for lampooning
himself so fearlessly in ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and Malkovich are my two favorites and, unfortunately,
neither will win (Murphy won't even be nominated) because of the
academy's blindness to the merits of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: That's not fair. Look at the general run of foreign
language Oscar winners over the past two decades _ their taste in
that category is hilarious, while at the same time poignantly
tragic. I'd say Pedro Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' which
has won the lion's share of the world's major film prizes, should
logically have that award all sewn up. But since it doesn't have a
sad-eyed little kid in it, the academy may well not be capable of
finding the film meaningful enough.
</P>
<P>
   I'd bet Almodovar has a good chance for an original screenplay
nomination, since the writer's branch is traditionally the
academy's most perceptive lot. But I don't know if being a
writer-director will work against him politically among that
oversensitive, turf-protective group, and it may have the same
effect on such other accomplished hyphenates as ``Three Kings'''
David O. Russell and ``Magnolia's'' P.T. Anderson. Don't think the
writers will exclude ``Sixth Sense's'' director M. Night Shyamalan,
though; that twist ending was Hollywood craftsmanship at its
undeniable apogee.
</P>
<P>
   Other original screenplay slam-dunks would be Alan Ball's
``Beauty'' and Charlie Kaufman's ``Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: It's a much more interesting bunch than the adapted
screenplay possibilities. Most of the year's touted literary
adaptations _ ``Angela's Ashes,'' ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' ``The
Cider House Rules'' _ didn't live up to the hype. ``The Insider''
certainly merits attention, even if screenwriters Michael Mann and
Eric Roth played loose with the facts in a needless attempt to
ratchet up the drama.
</P>
<P>
   But the best adaptation came courtesy of Anthony Minghella, who
took Patricia Highsmith's already rich source material and made it
a mesmerizing thriller of the highest order. Minghella lost in the
adapted screenplay category three years ago to Billy Bob Thornton's
``Sling Blade.'' This year, he should win for ``Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Of course, Minghella's a possibility for repeating best
director honors. But like most of the other major categories, the
competition's intense. I think he's a sure nomination, as is
``Beauty's'' Sam Mendes. But after that, it's a free-for-all.
Anybody who tackled a true story _ ``Hurricane's'' Norman Jewison,
``Insider's'' Michael Mann, ``Boys Don't Cry's'' Kimberly Peirce
and ``Topsy-Turvy's'' Mike Leigh _ has to contend with people
taking issue with the accuracy of their films. I'd sure like to see
Almodovar and ``Malkovich's'' Spike Jonze acknowledged for, at the
very least, their remarkable tonal control. But it's really
anybody's game.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: And let's not forget David Lynch, the man least likely to
make a G-rated Disney film, not to mention such a masterful one. It
would be nice, too, to see his collaborator, cinematographer
Freddie Francis, nominated for making those amber waves of grain
(and Farnsworth's expressive eyes) come alive in ``The Straight
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And while we're lobbying ... how about recognition for Gabriel
Yared's score for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and Rick Heinrichs'
evocative production design for ``Sleepy Hollow''?
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I'll push for Conrad Hall's exquisite ``American
Beauty'' cinematography, the musical contributions Aimee Mann and
Jon Brion made to ``Magnolia,'' and any of the songs from ``South
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Yup, those ``South Park'' guys sure did send you out of
the theater humming. And the great thing is, there are a fair
amount of people who want to vote for the movie, which underscores
the great diversity we enjoyed in movies last year. Now if Oscar
will just honor some of that originality ...
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Well, anything may seem possible this year, but let's
not get ridiculously optimistic. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles chiropractors must just love awards season. They
surely do a brisk business treating all those people who've
dislocated a shoulder or twisted an elbow while patting themselves
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Shameful, isn't it, this explosion of congratulations and
adulations every winter and spring for a bunch of people who spent
last year heaping kudos on each other on talk shows and accepting
the gratitude of executives in the form of six- or seven-figure
checks and the adoration of the masses in ticket sales, Billboard
rankings or TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Daily News counted 66 entertainment
industry award events. Since then we've just stopped counting. And
when you think about all the shows and TV segments devoted to the
award shows ... well it just boggles the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many other industries outside entertainment present annual
awards, but they don't expect the rest of us to watch them do it.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question: What if another business actually
televised its awards ceremony? Suppose you're at home with a dozen
friends and a nice spread of food, and you all settle down in front
of the big screen and tune in to ... HGTV.
</P>
<P>
   There are the searchlights, the screaming fans who camped out
for days, the camera flashes strobing into the night ... and Bob
Vila in a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   VILA: The red carpet _ a sturdy indoor-outdoor nylon fiber with
an extra-thick pad _ has been rolled out in front of the Van Nuys
Home Depot, where the big players in home building, remodeling and
decorating are gathering for the event of the year: The 12th annual
Home Improvement Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Homies, as you know, go to the best and brightest in the
various trades, with a new category added this year: best invoice
coming in 100 percent or more over estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the host for tonight's event, star of his own show on
another cable network, Mr. Glue Gun himself, Christopher Lowell.
Christopher, what should the viewers at home be expecting tonight?
</P>
<P>
   LOWELL: Well Bob, in addition to the presentation of the
hammer-shaped Homies in 37 categories, we've got a dance number
saluting wallpaper hangers, a montage of the year's best moments in
woodworking and a hilarious outtake reel of contractors who fudged
projects in violation of local codes without the property owners'
knowledge. And one exciting segment, one I've been pushing for the
past three years, is a tribute to that most underappreciated home
accent, pompon fringe.
</P>
<P>
   VILA: Sounds great, Christopher. Best of luck and we'll see you
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Al Grebowski of Like Lightning Electricians, up for
best rewiring of a formerly low-voltage 1960s suburban ranch house.
Look how his ensemble accentuates his carpenter's crack.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carlotta, is sporting a diamond- and ruby-encrusted
tool belt created just for this evening by Tiff Van Winston
jewelers of Beverly Hills. Of course, with a pricey accessory like
that, she is being escorted by armed security guards recruited at
dawn yesterday from among the day laborers hanging around outside
the store.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind the Grebowskis is Jake ``One Arm'' Fischbender, one
of the fastest shinglers in the roofing business until that
unfortunate incident three years ago with an electric nail gun.
It's great to see some of the past stars in the business. Welcome
back, Jake!
</P>
<P>
   FISCHBENDER: It's great to be here tonight, Bob. I just want to
say best of luck to all the nominees tonight, 'cause I know every
one of them is hoping to get Hammered.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the morning newspapers' breathless accounts of the
ceremony itself:
</P>
<P>
   John Dweenfanger of Outside Exteriors was the big winner
Saturday at the 12th annual Home Improvement Awards, capturing the
exterior stucco and window-caulking honors as expected, and scoring
an upset in paint color matching over favorite Larry Grubmeister of
To Dye For.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank my father-in-law, who let me apprentice
with him when I was in high school even though I was sleeping with
his daughter,'' Dweenfanger said, clutching his third Homie and
choking back tears. ``And I also want to thank my beautiful wife,
Shirley, who has been the company's bookkeeper and office manager
for 17 years. Honey, next year you get a paycheck, I promise!''
</P>
<P>
   The top Homie for which all trades are eligible _ the ``We'll be
there tomorrow by noon for sure'' award _ went to Stan Klebowitz of
Plumb Crazy. He was honored for abandoning a repiping job and
leaving a homeowner stranded without running water for 16 days,
just a few hours short of the state limit that could have cost him
his license. Klebowitz did not make an acceptance speech on advice
of his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ... After the ceremony, winners and nominees celebrated under a
tent of clear plastic sheeting at an affair catered by Taco Bell
and Budweiser, with sanitation services by Johnny on the Spot. As
expected, they left their cans and fast-food wrappers on the
floor. &QL;

TIJUANA, Mexico: not better treatment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's not to say conventional care has not had its successes.
Chemotherapy essentially has provided cures for testicular cancer
and Hodgkins' disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system, and it
performs reasonably well in many other cancers if they're detected
early enough. But for advanced cancers of the digestive system and
lungs, like Perrot's, the prognosis is usually hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Perrot's family nor Cynthia Cooper, her Comets teammate
and close friend, nor M.D. Anderson Cancer Center doctors would
talk about Perrot's decision to seek treatment in Tijuana. In her
only public comments on the decision, an interview segment aired
during halftime of a Comets' game telecast on Lifetime in June,
Cooper said the horrors of her mother's conventional cancer
treatment last year foreclosed that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kim) saw my mother go through chemotherapy so she knows the
potential danger of what it can do,'' said Cooper. ``She was the
first one to say, `Hey, I don't want to do chemotherapy. We gotta
do something, but I don't want to do chemotherapy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot went to Tijuana in May, following surgery to remove the
tumors and radiation. There, the 32-year-old, 5-foot-5-inch player
did ``detoxification'' treatment, a standard alternative practice
involving colonics, coffee enemas and juice diets, that seeks to
cleanse the body of toxins. The theory is that gallons of water
pumped into the large intestine during a colonic release poisons;
and that coffee enemas held for roughly 15 minutes stimulate the
liver and gall bladder to discharge bile.
</P>
<P>
   When Perrot returned to Houston in June, she was well enough to
become a familiar face at Comets practices and games, receiving her
championship ring one night and even traveling with the team on a
trip.
</P>
<P>
   But Perrot's visits to the Comets became far less frequent and,
on July 17, she returned to Tijuana. This time, Perrot pursued a
therapy that has become the new buzz in alternative circles _
insulin-induced coma therapy. It involves injecting the patient
with enough insulin to put him or her into a hypoglycemic sleep for
30 to 60 minutes, during which time cancer cells are starved of the
blood sugar they feed on. The treatment is typically given 30 to 50
times over a period of six to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, which one expert described as plausible-sounding
but risky, was used on mental patients from the 1930s to early '60s
before it was superseded by electric shock therapy.
Serendipitously, in 1957, a New Jersey psychiatrist found it
improved the cancer of two mental patients, but the state stopped
him from treating cancer patients with it, and it was never pursued
as a treatment thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a Tijuana clinic named BioPulse revived the therapy,
mostly with Stage 4 cancer patients. Since then, according to
President Loran Swensen, BioPulse has treated 26 patients, five of
whom died _ none while undergoing the procedure _ five of whom are
in remission and the rest of whom are somewhere in between. Swensen
said he will continue the treatment ``as long as we're helping more
than we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been called everything from saints to charlatans,'' said
Swensen, whose treatment, comprising state-of-the-art medical
facilities and five-star hotel accommodations, costs $24,000 for
four weeks and $3,000 a week thereafter, the most of any clinic in
Tijuana. ``Hopefully, we're somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   High fees raise eyebrows among skeptics. They're less than
conventional cancer-care fees, of course, but since most insurance
plans don't cover Tijuana treatment, they've been known to cause
patients to mortgage homes or exhaust what would have been their
children's inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Perrot never followed through on the treatment.
After undergoing a five-day preliminary treatment BioPulse requires
to monitor and gauge how much insulin each patient needs, Perrot
did only two ``comas.'' She was in unbearable pain, and BioPulse's
attempt to take her to a radiation lab _ her cancer was approaching
the spinal cord _ failed when the machine was being calibrated and
unavailable for use.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana's limited infrastructure and Perrot's non-celebrity
status in Mexico kept her from getting radiation for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Perrot, her sister and mother went to another
clinic, International Biologics, whose treatment method involves
injecting into cancer patients live animal fetal cells, which
purportedly rejuvenate tissue. But according to IB's head doctor,
soon after Kim was admitted, the family received a phone call from
Cooper in Houston, and they headed off to C.H.I.P.S.A., which
provides nutritional and detoxification therapy and stresses the
role of dental problems and modern dentistry techniques in cancer,
but also uses conventional methods like radiation and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   C.H.I.P.S.A. doctors did a number of conventional therapies to
stabilize Perrot, including radiation and blood infusions, but by
then the cancer was ravaging her body. A few weeks later, her
condition much worse, Perrot was airlifted back to Houston, where
she received aggressive treatment in the intensive-care unit and
went on life support. Four days later, on Aug. 19, she died.
</P>
<P>
   Was Perrot, beloved Houston figure and role model, foolish to
travel to Tijuana when she had world-class conventional facilities
in Houston? Would she have fared better _ lived longer, suffered
less _ had she pursued treatment at M.D. Anderson? Most oncologists
would say yes, of course, but some experts aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on your risk/reward system,'' says David Hess,
a medical anthropologist and professor of Science and Technology
Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Rochester, N.Y., and
author of ``Evaluating Alternative Cancer Therapies.'' ``Do you
undergo conventional treatment that prolongs your life one to three
unpleasant years but leaves little chance of miraculous recovery?
Or do you try a riskier treatment that causes less side effects and
very occasionally results in pocket survivors? It's up to the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The individual drawn to the Tijuana clinics, according to
studies, tends to be educated, relatively affluent, roughly 50
years old and either unhappy with conventional care options or
already finished with them. A study by UT Houston Health Science
Center professor Mary Ann Richardson also found a significant
percentage went to Tijuana because chemotherapy violated their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism of Tijuana, it does have indisputable
strengths. For example, it occasionally will offer treatment that
is later accepted in conventional medicine. Some practitioners were
using diphosphate drugs for bone metastasis and hormonal blockades
for prostate cancer long before both became accepted treatment in
conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the practitioners can come with high credentials or
be held in high regard. BioPulse's head doctor, Bernarda Lara, was
Mother Teresa's personal physician. Nobel Prize-winning
doctor-missionary Albert Schweitzer called Max Gerson, the inventor
of the nutritional therapy employed at C.H.I.P.S.A., ``one of the
most eminent medical geniuses in the history of medicine.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
TIJUANA, Mexico: history of medicine.'' Yet no one denies there are con artists, some of whom have been
prosecuted, found guilty of fraud and sentenced to years in U.S.
prison. There was also the clinic in the late 1980s whose
diagnostic methods couldn't differentiate between human blood and
chicken and cat blood submitted by a Los Angeles Times reporter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to make queasy even those cancer-resource services
less than enthusiastic about conventional care. The editors of two
publications that provide regularly updated information on
promising alternative treatments _ CanHelp and The Moss Report _
say they are currently not recommending any Tijuana clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make too blanket a condemnation of the Tijuana
clinics because occasionally they do glom onto something and hit a
jackpot,'' says Ralph Moss, the author of 11 books on
cancer-related topics. ``But most make me uneasy _ they succeed
first and foremost as freewheeling capitalistic ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   To the adventurous cancer patient, Moss and CanHelp editor
Patrick McGrady recommend Germany's alternative clinics, which,
supported by that government's health-care system, charge
reasonable amounts and reflect the country's state-of-the-art
technology and sophisticated understanding of immunity and cancer.
Tijuana's cancer clinics have been described as a Third World
version of the German model.
</P>
<P>
   Moss acknowledges that his optimism regarding the curative role
of herbs in cancer treatment, celebrated in his book ``Herbs
Against Cancer,'' has not been borne out and says he would not want
to encourage cancer patients to forsake better therapies for them.
He and many holistic doctors say herbs are best for boosting the
immune system and minimizing the side effects of chemotherapy, not
killing tumors.
</P>
<P>
   That is unhappy news for many patients. A Canadian study by Dr.
Eduardo Bruera, now M.D. Anderson's chief of palliative care, found
75 percent of advanced cancer patients taking alternative treatment
(along with chemotherapy) were doing so out of hope it would kill
the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for patients who want to treat cancer with only
natural products because they think that will be easier on their
bodies, holistic doctors warn that the strongest anti-tumor herbs
are no picnic either. One, scorpion, is hard to get in the United
States because it is so toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the striking thing about the Tijuana clinics is that despite
all odds, they flourish. Even when they seem transparently nutty,
like the doctor who argues that cancer is usually a misdiagnosis of
parasites, it is not hard to find a patient who says he or she was
at death's door until starting the clinic's therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing clinics like those in Tijuana often bring is an
intangible quality, a stimulation of patients' positive beliefs
that all doctors should take note of,'' says Caryle Hirschberg, a
biochemist whose book ``Remarkable Recovery'' examines mysterious
cures that defy current medical knowledge and questions why doctors
aren't more curious about them. ``If a doctor gives chemotherapy
with enthusiasm, patients will do a lot better than if he or she
gives it with little chance of doing much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschberg says spontaneous remission, the inexplicable
disappearance of a tumor, is more frequent than the oft-cited
estimation that it occurs once in every 100,000 cases. She says her
research suggests the cases never reported alone are 10- to 25-fold
greater than that.
</P>
<P>
   One place to find such apparent recoveries is an herbal clinic
known as Hoxsey, the one Carol Main made the videotape about. In
the only peer-reviewed study of the Tijuana clinics published to
date, six of 16 advanced-cancer patients at Hoxsey _ including two
with lung cancer and two with melanoma, among the nastiest cancers
_ claimed to be cancer-free five or more years later.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, which originated in Dallas before authorities drove
it out of the United States in the late 1950s, was the subject of
an award-winning 1987 documentary ``Hoxsey: How Healing Becomes a
Crime.'' One critic said it did to the American Medical Association
what was done to General Motors by Michael Moore's award-winning
``Roger &AMP; Me,'' the documentary on the effect of the automobile
company's closing of a factory.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary interviews patients whose doctors told them that
Hoxsey, ``the worst cancer quack of the century,'' would take all
their money. ``How can they?'' replies one. ``You already have.''
Now ``Hoxsey'' author Ken Ausubel is shopping around a feature-film
script on the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   One Tijuana patient hoping for a remarkable recovery is Jackie
Morales. A 49-year-old Colorado social worker, she was told in
July, after 19 surgeries and a bone marrow transplant, that her
Stage 3 cancer had become Stage 4, that she had more than 100
cancerous tumors in the bone, lungs and brain and that she probably
had six months to live. Since starting treatments at BioPulse in
late October, her brain lesions and lung tumors are gone and the
bone cancer is down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is 200 percent better emotionally, physically,
spiritually,'' said Morales, sweat-drenched but energetic after
awakening from a coma treatment. ``I don't know how long I'm going
to be around, but I feel like a different person, I feel like I
have dignity again. If I go today, that will be OK. And if I go in
20 years, that will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana's testimonials are generally dismissed by cancer
specialists as random statistical anomalies with no discernible
cause. But others, interested in determining if there is a way to
kick-start the healing system, are starting to scour the globe to
study such outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that there are two ways to do research _ locking
yourself in a laboratory or going out in the world and
investigating what people have done _ those researchers say they
want to find clinics whose records demonstrate clusters of a dozen
or more ``exceptional positive outcomes'' in cancers that were not
expected to respond.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they argue, such therapies can be improved
upon by cancer-industry researchers, as has been the case
historically. A quarter of chemotherapy drugs, for instance, were
derived from herbs, including etoposide, a favorite remedy of
19th-century alternative doctors.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that few conventional doctors are knowledgeable
about the alternatives that cancer patients are pursuing. In
Bruera's study, for instance, the patients taking complementary
therapies in hopes they would kill their cancer were left to their
own devices instead of working in conjunction with the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   It is a recipe, say some, that lead the Kim Perrots of the world
to seek treatment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we don't have that we need is more oncologists who
know something about complementary cancer treatment,'' said UT's
Richardson. ``We need cancer specialists who are open and informed
enough to advise patients about what can be done to, say, minimize
the toxic effects of chemotherapy, so they don't head off for
Tijuana.''

   WASHINGTON _ Some sympathic voters, and even Al Gore, appeared
today to downplay Bill Bradley's disclosure that he's had
additional irregular heartbeat episodes. But while Bradley insists
the problem is irrelevant to his campaign, Cox's Ken Foskett
reports that he's being peppered with questions about his heart
today at the expense of other issues. Bradley dismisses the
epiosodes as a ``nuisance'' possibly caused by drinking too much
caffeine in cream sodas.
</P>
<P>
   MY ATTACKS ARE BETTER THAN YOURS
</P>
<P>
   Striking back against front-runner George W. Bush, John McCain
aired a new 30-second ad in New Hampshire, accusing Bush of
breaking his promise to steer clear of negative campaigning. McCain
also accuses Bush of misleading voters over taxes. ``Mr. Bush's
attacks are wrong,'' says McCain.
</P>
<P>
   PALMETTO POINTS TO W.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush holds a commanding lead over John McCain in a
poll of likely Republican South Carolina voters released today.
When asked who they would vote for in the state's Feb. 19 primary,
51 percent said Bush, 29 percent said McCain. The others were in
single digits. The Clemson University Palmetto Poll has a 4
percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   ALL POLITICS, ALL THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN is geared up for nonstop coverage of the campaign in
Iowa, where the first votes will be tallied Monday night. All
weekend, C-SPAN will air live and taped events featuring all of
presidential candidates. ``Washington Journal,'' its daily call-in
program, also will originate from Iowa. And on Monday night, C-SPAN
plans to broadcast live from a caucus site in Ames. Look for the
same type of coverage next weekend, too _ from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   THE KEY TO KEYES' SURGE
</P>
<P>
   Those who think Alan Keyes is gaining support for his long-shot
campaign can point to Lynn Goodrich, who was the Forbes for
President chairman in Harrison County. He is now endorsing Keyes.
Today's Wall Street Journal says Keyes has used strong debate
appearances in the debates to surge past Gary Bauer, who
pre-election pundits had predicted would have the support of social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON
</P>
<P>
   Fuming over a New York GOP effort to remove his name from the
state's primary ballot, John McCain accused party leaders of making
New York less democratic than Russia. McCain stood outside the
Russian consulate in Manhattan and declared that voters in Moscow
and St. Petersburg have a wider choice at the polls than those in
the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   A NARROWING IN THE BAY STATE
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only a recent health problem for Bill Bradley; it's a
recent polling problem, too. He is depending on big support in the
Northeast, but is losing ground in Massachusetts to Al Gore. A new
University of Massachusetts poll has Gore up 42 percent to 36
percent (the rest were undecided or mum). A similar UMass poll in
October showed Bradley leading 43 percent to 35 percent. But
because the poll's margin of error is 6 percentage points, it's
still considered a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD IOWANS FEEL DISSED?
</P>
<P>
   In two noisy rallies in western Iowa, Al Gore accused Bill
Bradley of committing ``a disservice to Iowa'' when he suggested
that any lead Gore enjoys in Iowa is due to the ``entrenched
power'' of his backers in the Democratic Party establishment and
labor union hierarchy. ``Fighting for family farmers, fighting for
pharmaceutical benefits for seniors, fighting for improvements in
our schools _ that's not entrenched power; that's fighting for
people,'' Gore roared.
</P>
<P>
   IF IT'S FRIDAY ...
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush, Bill Bradley and Al Gore are in Iowa today
trying to win in Monday's caucuses, John McCain, who is not
competing there, was in South Carolina. Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch and
Steve Forbes also were in Iowa. Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan
was in Arlington, Va., addressing the Conservative Political Action
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL RIVALS, ABORTION RIGHTS SOUL MATES
</P>
<P>
   With their husbands campaigning in Iowa, Ernestine Bradley and
Tipper Gore made a rare joint appearance to reaffirm their spouses'
support for abortion rights. The two would-be first ladies spoke at
a National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League dinner
commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v.
Wade decision that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   THAT OLD MOTHERLY LOVE
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all of you who are helping George W. Bush get
elected,'' said Barbara Bush said at the airport in Lebanon, N.H. _
a practiced campaigner on yet another stump. ``I can't tell you how
overwhelming that is for a mother to say,'' she declared. ``This
guy,'' she went on, smiling even more broadly, ``is just a great
son and father and husband.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSING FOR DAD
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, eldest daughter of Al and Tipper, will
travel by bus from New York to New Hampshire this weekend with
GoreNet volunteers to campaign on behalf of her father. Schiff, 26,
is a third-year law school student at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   TOUTING GORE ON HIGH-TECH
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and Commerce Secretary Bill
Daley are set to visit a growing high-tech company in Londonderry
on Monday, Prototype Circuits, to focus on benefits of Al Gore's
economic plans.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH OUT FOR THAT LEFTIST RASCAL
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes urged a gathering of conservatives
in Arlington, Va., to reject George W. Bush, warning he'll move the
party to left. ``Nominate him and this party will go down to bitter
defeat,'' he told the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Forbes, addressing the group by satellite from Iowa, said, ``If we
go for mush and moderation, we won't win the trust of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW MEDIA PLAYING FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Network evening newscasts spent far less time covering the
presidential campaign in 1999 than they did four years earlier.
ABC, CBS and NBC had 37 percent to 55 percent less campaign
coverage last year than in 1995, when President Clinton was gearing
up to defend against eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole, according to
the Center for Media and Public Affairs. But the news landscape has
changed: Three cable news networks are covering the campaign, and
Internet coverage has grown markedly.
</P>
<P>
   EARNING POINTS FOR SECOND SPOT?
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, at the behest of George W. Bush,
will head to New Hampshire this weekend to bash John McCain's tax
plan. Pataki said he would be joined Saturday in Manchester by Sen.
Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
Pataki is considered a potential running mate for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   EDGE ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   If presidential races were won solely by online news images, a
new study says, Bill Bradley and John McCain would be the winners.
During the past six weeks, Bradley and McCain got their political
message placed prominently and positively on the sites most likely
to be used by potential voters surfing the Web for news, said Hass
Associates of Ann Arbor, Mich. The candidates' own Web sites were
not counted.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THE BALLOTS OF BABES
</P>
<P>
   If children mimic their parents, then it's all over. Al Gore and
George W. Bush were winners in a mock caucus staged by Iowa's
schoolchildren. Gore beat Bill Bradley 56.6-43.4 percent in the
first Iowa Youth Mock Caucus. Bush won with about half of the vote,
well ahead of Steve Forbes' 16.6 percent, Alan Keyes' 15.6, John
McCain's 7.9, Gary Bauer's 6.4 and Orrin Hatch's 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BOXER PUTS NEW PAC IN THE RING
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) launched a Web site for her
political action committee that she hopes will raise $1 million for
House and Senate Democrats to help her party win a majority in
Congress. Boxer said she realizes that ``we can't change the world
the way we want to unless we have more Democrats in both houses.''
She said her PAC for a Change is the first of its kind to focus on
fund-raising for candidates in both chambers.

DESPERATE CANCER PATIENTS FLOCK TO TIJUANA'S ALTERNATIVE CLINICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 23) 
(Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Carreno) 
 
By TODD ACKERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Four weeks before she died of lung cancer,
professional women's basketball player Kim Perrot arrived at an
undistinguished-looking, six-story building that houses one of this
border city's better-known alternative hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the point guard's third clinic of the day, and the
merry-go-round had not exactly eased the excruciating pain in her
neck. By the time hospital staffers pulled her from the back seat
of the car and wheeled her into the hospital, her mother and sister
at her side, her howling was deafening.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shrieking so loud you could hear it to the sixth
floor,'' said Ronald Carreno, the Centro Hospitalario Internacional
Pacifico, or C.H.I.P.S.A., physician who treated Perrot of the
WNBA's Houston Comets. ``We did what we could, but she was too far
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot went to Tijuana, eschewing the advice of conventional
medicine, for a simple reason: hope.
</P>
<P>
   This mecca of alternative medicine lures thousands of advanced
cancer patients every year, from the United States and beyond, only
too happy, in their quest for a cure, to try treatments shunned or
banned back home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their notoriety, little is known about the efficacy
of the Tijuana clinics' magic elixirs, coffee enemas, live cell
injections and other unorthodox remedies. The U.S. medical
establishment scorns them as quackery preying on the desperate,
robbing their pocketbooks, but only now are the clinics and
therapies beginning to be evaluated by medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   That Perrot died was unlikely the fault of any Tijuana
practitioner. After all, cancers like Perrot's _ Stage 4 lung
cancer that has spread to the brain _ are considered virtually
incurable, and the average survival is three to six months. (Perrot
lived seven.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, few people would deny that Tijuana's cancer clinics are a
risky gamble, a mix of agonizing deaths and miracle recoveries,
scam artists and well-intentioned healers, latest fads and
centuries-old approaches, unkempt holes in the wall and modern
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bewildering scene, and not just for advanced cancer
patients unwilling to accept inevitable death. Scientists armed
with grants to study Tijuana's clinics have made scant progress in
the past decade, and even U.S. alternative medical practitioners
who might be inclined to be open to Tijuana's alleged strengths
complain that the lack of hard information about what's good and
what isn't leaves them unable to advise patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an outrage we still don't have an answer to the simple
question of how effective the clinics in Tijuana are,'' said Leanna
Standish, a doctor of holistic medicine and director of research at
Bastyr University, an accredited institution in Washington state
dedicated to the study of natural medical practices. ``Every year,
Americans dump thousands of dollars in treatment there, but we
don't know if it's valuable, useless or harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend a lot more than that on alternative cancer
treatment in the United States. A recent survey found roughly 68
percent of University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center patients
in Houston use some sort of alternative or complementary medicine,
be it acupuncture, herbs, disciplines such as yoga, or mind-body
exercises such as guided imagery; other surveys have found just
under 10 percent of patients entirely forsake conventional care for
alternative treatment, up from a few percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, there is an array of choices besides the Tijuana
clinics:Other border towns such as Matamoros and Juarez; the
Bahamas and the Caribbean; and a number of European countries,
especially Germany, whose alternative clinics are considered the
world's most advanced.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Tijuana that has most captured the popular image of
alternative cancer treatment. The city itself, where the First and
Third worlds meet, has long been famous for its seediness and
poverty. It's also the foreign city most visited by U.S. tourists,
now less a tribute to its red-light district than to its general
ambience, shopping, and cheap pharmaceuticals and lax medical laws.
</P>
<P>
   The last has made Tijuana the place for many unorthodox U.S.
practitioners to hang a shingle. Often located in decrepit
buildings and accessed only by hilly, potholed roads, they draw
patients with a distrust of the conventional cancer-care industry
and a faith in ``nontoxic therapies without side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Many such patients stay at motels on the U.S. side of the border
and take vans to the clinics, chatting cheerfully about their good
fortune to be able to receive treatment in Tijuana. On one recent
trip, Alaska patient Carol Main told fellow riders, ``If I had an
insurance policy that allowed me to be treated anywhere else in the
world for free, I'd still pay to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after her doctor gave her six months to live
because of pancreatic cancer, Main is so grateful to the Tijuana
clinic that treated her she has made a 50-minute videotape about
it, complete with the admonition that cancer victims ``don't have
to die'' and testimonials of other patients who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely to convince skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of testimonials mean absolutely nothing to me,''
said Dr. Barrie Cassileth, chief of integrative medicine at
Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York and a member of the American
Cancer Society's board of directors. ``They say nothing about all
the Tijuana patients who die. The bottom line is: Those clinics are
costly, dangerous and don't work. They're a scam.''
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana's clinics have inspired such passion among both sides
since the 1960s. Its heyday was the late '70s and early '80s, when
actor Steve McQueen's cancer treatment was big news in the
tabloids. If the traffic slightly abated in the late 1990s, say
observers, it's probably because the explosion of alternative
medicine in the United States has lessened the need for some
patients to make the journey south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Cassileth recommends that advanced cancer patients who feel they
have nothing to lose should instead stay in the United States and
participate in clinical trials of new conventional treatment.
Citing a study in which subjects posed as cancer patients, she
alleges that all the Tijuana clinics promise to cure cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But people keep going to Tijuana's clinics, and one reason is
conventional medicine's failure to conquer cancer. Since President
Nixon proclaimed war on cancer, annual American cancer deaths have
grown from 340,000 in 1971 to 555,000 today, and it's poised to
overtake heart disease as the nation's No. 1 killer early in this
millennium. The latest statistics, from 1990 to 1995, show a
decline in the death rate of one-half of 1 percent, but critics say
the main reason is less smoking and earlier diagnosis, not better
treatment.

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS ARE THE HOT TICKET NOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Fla.)  (af) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional mutual fund industry may be in a funk, but the
interest of the money management business in so-called
exchange-traded funds, indexed offerings that trade like stocks, is
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Two big money management firms are poised to introduce dozens of
new exchange-traded funds, or ETFs as they are sometimes known, in
the next few months, according to government filings.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Bank and Trust _ which already administers the
popular SPDRs fund, known as spiders, which tracks the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, and Diamonds, which track the Dow Jones
industrials _ has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to offer eight new ETFs on the American Stock Exchange next
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the funds will track newly created Dow Jones indexes for
large- and small-capitalization value stocks, and large- and
small-cap growth stocks. The rest of State Street's new funds will
invest in particular industry sectors, but State Street, based in
Boston, has not disclosed which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Barclays Global Investors, filed a registration
statement and prospectus last month for a total of 36 funds, all
under the iShares Trust moniker. Barclays made preliminary filings
for the funds last spring and will introduce them around March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The indexes that the Barclays funds will track include the S&AMP;P
500, putting it in direct competition with State Street's spiders,
as well as the S&AMP;P/Barra Growth and Value indexes. The Russell 2000
and 3000 indexes will get their own ETFs, as will value and growth
variations on those benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   And Barclays will offer a variety of sector funds, based on Dow
Jones industry benchmarks, including technology, Internet,
telecommunications, consumer cyclicals and noncyclicals, and energy
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more ETFs you have, the more attention these things are
going to get,'' said Jim Novakoff, a partner with Levitt, Novakoff
&AMP; Co., an investment firm in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs are gaining momentum in the index fund market because they
offer some advantages over traditional funds. Like stocks, they can
be traded throughout the day, bought on margin or with limit
orders, or sold short. ETFs tend to have fees in line with index
funds offered by the low-cost Vanguard Group, the leading index
fund company, and have a more efficient tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantage for some ETFs is a problem known as cash drag:
Many of the funds, including spiders, are structured as unit
investment trusts which allow dividends to be reinvested only
quarterly, creating a drag on performance as cash dividends build
up in between quarters. The new funds being introduced by State
Street and Barclays _ like existing Select Sector SPDRs and World
Equity Benchmarks, or WEBs, which track particular foreign markets
_ will be structured as open-end funds, avoiding the cash drag
problem.
</P>
<P>
   So Barclays' new S&AMP;P 500 ETF may pose a challenge to State
Street's spiders, introduced in 1993. Gus Fleites, director of
exchange-traded funds at State Street Global Advisors, the bank's
investment division of State Street Bank and Trust, said it was
looking into ways of addressing cash drag within the unit
investment trust structure, but said it was not currently an issue
for spiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the spider today _ if you see a cash drag in it, let
me know because I don't see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that the open-end structure is superior in
general, he noted that most of the companies now in the S&AMP;P 500 do
not pay dividends. Moreover, in the current bull market, the share
prices are rising so quickly that the dividends are a very small
percentage of the share price, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fleites said he welcomed the competition because it would bring
more attention to all ETFs. ``The traditional index mutual funds
are the ones that should be really concerned,'' he said. ``If
retail investors start to understand what the potential is of these
funds as opposed to traditional products, that will really present
a challenge to the traditional index mutual funds.''

 &HT;    Christianity has many rivals in fight for souls
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Welcome to the first century _ of the
first millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar insists that we are beginning the 21st century, but
the religious scene for the next hundred years or so will look more
like the first century than any since.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity, while still the overwhelming religious choice for
Americans, has lost its near monopoly on the care of souls in the
West. The faith now competes with a cornucopia of spiritual choices
for the allegiance of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been so since Christianity burst on the scene in
the first century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like then, God is popular. Many people yearn for the kind
of meaning that religious faith can provide. And there is a
supermarket of religious products available to fill those needs.
</P>
<P>
   Islam is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism, Hinduism and other Eastern religions are now American
faiths practiced by American-born children of Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   New Age rites, Native American spirituality and astrology, among
many others, vie for recognition with Judaism and countless
Christian permutations. That rich potpourri of religious choice has
not existed for 1,600 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early fourth century, the emperor Constantine declared
Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire. The battle for
spiritual supremacy essentially ended in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone became at least nominally Christian except
for Jews who, as a result, were persecuted. That religious status
quo prevailed even through the Reformation, until the rationalism
of the 18th century began to nibble away at all forms of spiritual
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first century, many religious options greeted
spiritual yearning. The official religion of the Roman Empire
remained. Few took it seriously. The Olympian myth no longer made
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Pax Romana, or the peace of Rome, provided stability around the
diverse Mediterranean basin. Trade flourished, bringing in its wake
multiple religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The cults of the Great Mother from Asia Minor and Isis from
Egypt were popular. The Persian Mithras, the faith of a dying and
rising god, challenged early Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   There were several Jewish sects and a number of different ways
to understand the latest Jewish cult called Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Within 300 years, Christianity prevailed. And the rich
competition for religious truth has not known such energy since.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The information age today offers even greater opportunity for
the flow of ideas than Pax Romana. Christianity still reigns, but
for many, the ancient myth has lost its power to convince.
</P>
<P>
   Like the situation in the first century, no one faith dominates
the field. Spiritual yearning is extraordinary. Spiritual
opportunities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for souls is on _ again.

 &HT;    HEALTH CARE PROVIDES CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN GORE-BRADLEY RACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In the final days before the Iowa
presidential caucus and the New Hampshire primary, the most
contentious issue on the Democratic side is health care.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few issues where Vice President Al Gore and
Bill Bradley actually have major differences.
</P>
<P>
   But the occasional red-hot rhetoric and the eye-glazing number
crunching that has characterized their debates over health care has
been perplexing, even to those who follow the issue closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many activists are confused,'' said Steve Gorin, a professor
of health care at Plymouth State College in New Hampshire and an
organizer for ``New Hampshire Asks,'' a health care advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bradley has outlined his proposals in a clear
and concise way. Consequently, few activists are taking sides, at
least at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are another matter, however. Sen. Ted Kennedy of
Massachusetts, the leading voice on health care in the Democratic
Party, has endorsed Gore and is scheduled to appear with him in
Waterloo, Iowa, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care plan is much more sweeping than Gore's,
part of the ``big ideas'' he has espoused as the core of his
challenge to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But when he speaks of his plan, or when he is responding to
criticism from Gore, Bradley often lapses into a discussion of
``weighted averages'' or other technical aspects of it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gore, rather than dwell too long on his own
proposal, repeatedly lashes Bradley for a plan he claims would
``shred the safety net'' for poorer Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And in suggesting that reforms be built on the existing health
care system, he subtly reminds Democrats of the disastrous
political consequences that followed the Clinton administration's
health care reform effort in 1994: the plan was defeated in
Congress and it contributed to the Democratic Party's loss of
majority control of the House that year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not as harsh in his criticism Friday, however, as he
toured Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines in an effort to contrast
his health care plan with Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bradley's health plan is based on ``a respectable theory
not to be dismissed out of hand.'' He added, ``Although I do
dismiss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days ago, Gore's criticism had a much harsher edge: ``He's
a good man with a bad plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ever since Bradley unveiled his proposal last September,
Gore has charged that it not only would eliminate health care plans
on which poorer Americans depend, but also would cost so much that
it would use up the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the vice president aimed his criticism more at
the Republican presidential candidates than at Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that in the Democratic caucus contest, we are having
an in-depth and full debate about how to expand health care to
every American,'' Gore said. ``In the Republican contest, they're
debating how to blow the entire surplus on a risky tax scheme that
would benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's response to Gore's criticism has been consistent: he
suggests that the vice president would rather take ``little steps''
rather than act boldly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``proposes nibbling around the edges,'' he told a gathering
of elderly Iowans in Des Moines on Thursday. ``There is a major
difference here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan starts with the abolition of Medicaid, one of the
programs that provides health care assistance to poor people.
Instead, he would provide tax subsidies to purchase health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He also would allow Americans to buy into the Federal Employee
Health Benefit Program, which provides coverage to federal
employees and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His plan also calls for all Americans, regardless of income, to
deduct the cost of their health insurance premiums from their
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, he would uncap prescription drug benefits under
Medicare, the health care program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He puts the cost at $65 billion annually, though some critics
put the price tag much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan is more incremental, building on the current
Medicaid program and the Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP), the federal-state program that provides coverage for poor
and near-poor children.
</P>
<P>
   He would extend CHIP and Medicaid eligibility and allow
uninsured children above the income eligibility cutoff to buy into
the programs. He also would let uninsured people aged 55 to 65 buy
into Medicare. He would provide tax credits of up to 25 percent for
individuals buying their own insurance and for small businesses who
provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Bradley, he would provide prescription drug coverage
under Medicare, but capped at $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore estimates his program would cost $25 billion. But again,
some critics say the cost would be higher, though not as high as
Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising to some political observers is that health
care has taken on such an importance in the presidential campaign,
at least on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage of the uninsured is back on the political agenda,
long before any observer of the 1994 fiasco would have predicted,''
said Robert Reischauer, a budget and health care expert at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, when President Clinton came into office promising
health care reform, about 39 million Americans lacked health care
insurance. Today, that number is 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, polls show that the aging American population is
concerned about health care, particularly amid predictions that
Medicare is going to run out of money as the number of baby boomers
retire.

 &HT;    HEALTH CARE PROVIDES CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN GORE-BRADLEY RACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In the final days before the Iowa
presidential caucus and the New Hampshire primary, the most
contentious issue on the Democratic side is health care.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few issues where Vice President Al Gore and
Bill Bradley actually have major differences.
</P>
<P>
   But the occasional red-hot rhetoric and the eye-glazing number
crunching that has characterized their debates over health care has
been perplexing, even to those who follow the issue closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many activists are confused,'' said Steve Gorin, a professor

<P>
   DRUG-MERGER (Undated) _ On Procter &AMP; Gamble's talks with
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products about some form of a
combination. By Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SMUGGLING (Beijing) _ With mounting intensity, China's
leaders have railed about the mortal dangers that smuggling and
corruption pose to the society and to Communist Party rule. Now, as
details emerge of the largest smuggling scandal yet _ a conspiracy
that apparently involved dozens of Party, police and banking
officials and virtually the entire customs department of a major
seaport _ the basis for those fears is becoming clearer. The case
suggests critical weaknesses of the Communist Party and its ability
to govern the vast country. By Erik Eckholm. With map.
</P>
<P>
   (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-CONSERVATIVES (Undated) _ Despite the best efforts of
George W. Bush to keep the race in the center, the upcoming Iowa
caucuses have put a decidedly rightward slant on the GOP side of
the equation, as Bush appealed for votes from religious
conservatives and Steve Forbes continued to hammer him on the
abortion question. Meanwhile Forbes is trying to cast himself as
the only real conservative opponent to Bush as Alan Keyes continues
to run strongly here. By Frank Bruni and Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Washington) _ The Food and Drug Administration
on Friday announced it is temporarily shutting down every human
gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania after an
inspection uncovered a litany of federal rule violations by
scientists conducting a clinical trial that cost an 18-year-old
Arizona man his life. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   BOX-ORGANIZATION (Undated) _ Many critics say the pivotal
problem in boxing today is that there is no central governing body,
as there are in other professional sports, that would enforce
safety rules, create credible rankings and ensure that the best
fighters rise. In short, no one is in charge. By James C. McKinley
Jr. 3,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   With photo NYT8.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS-GROWTH (Undated) _ Looking at companies' previews of
fourth-quarter earnings and the pace of earnings growth so far. The
1999 fourth quarter is shaping up as one of the strongest periods
of earnings growth in years, and may help explain why the stock
market continues to be resilient despite interest rate fears. By
Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-SOLDIERS (Washington) _ After months of resistance, the
Pentagon has dropped its opposition to establishing 18 as the
minimum age for sending soldiers into combat, clearing the way for
negotiators in Geneva today to complete a new international
protocol prohibiting the use of child soldiers in war. The Clinton
administration, under pressure from military commanders, had
insisted for months that any agreement allow the United States the
option of sending volunteers as young as 17 into combat. By Steven
Lee Myers.

 &HT;    Food experts look into their crystal bowls for a look at what's
ahead
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The exciting new flavor making its way around New York foodie
circles _ and we're not making this up _ is dried fennel pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the very essence of fennel,'' says Food &AMP; Wine editor
Dana Cowin, who recently ate pork dusted with the intense seasoning
and has spotted it on hot restaurant menus around town. ``New York
is a trend incubator. And when something comes on strong in New
York, I have to believe that it will eventually eke its way across
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether dried fennel pollen makes it onto the spice shelves of
our nearest Piggly Wiggly in this decade _ or even this millennium
_ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a century ago we might have laughed at the
suggestion that in our foreseeable future we'd be eating ice cream
in edible cones, or pulling summer squash out of our own iceboxes
in the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   One benchmark of the major changes and developments of the past
century is with what we were having for dinner at the time. What we
ate and how we ate it often mirrored what was going on in our lives
and in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What trends are most likely to mark the way we eat in the first
decade of this century? We asked four experts whose jobs involve
following changes in consumer cooking and eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DANA COWIN
</P>
<P>
   Editor, Food &AMP; Wine magazine
</P>
<P>
   Besides dried fennel pollen, Cowin and her trendmeisters predict
in this month's Food &AMP; Wine that pork will be the ``meat of the
millennium.'' Also big in 2000: oven-roasted whole fish; Latin
ingredients such as guava paste and Scotch bonnet chiles; chestnut
flour, used in rustic sweets, pastas, pierogi and other Eastern
European staples; nut oils such as almond and pistachio.
</P>

   Award-winning cookbook author and New York restaurant consultant
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for wasabi (a green powder or paste used as a condiment
in Japanese cooking, with a strong, sharp taste similar to
horseradish) to become a pantry staple. You'll be seeing wasabi
mashed potatoes, vinaigrette, cream cheese wasabi,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that's already a favorite with New York foodies
and will no doubt trickle down is pomegranate molasses. It has a
Middle Eastern flavor that's sweet and tart at the same time and
great for marinating anything from fish to steak to lamb. People
will also be talking about an intoxicating Middle Eastern spice
blend called za'atar which is 10 times more interesting than
oregano and basil. By 2001, I predict it will be sprinkled on every
single slice of pizza in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are rediscovering heirloom foods. What is old is now
new to us and being rediscovered. Heirloom tomatoes, ancient grapes
will capture our interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much like we used to be into flavored olive oils, people will
become very honey-savvy. Also American cheeses are coming of age
and finally getting respect around the world.''

<P>
   &QR;  BRIAN
</P>
<P>
   SANSONI
</P>
<P>
   Senior manager, public policy communications, Grocery
Manufacturers of America
</P>
<P>
   ``We are likely to see continuing interest in functional foods
and beverages _ products that can provide health benefits beyond
basic nutrition, when consumed as part of a balanced diet. Products
that fit under this umbrella include: calcium-fortified orange
juice, cranberry juice that is helpful in warding off urinary tract
infection, cholesterol-lowering margarines, ketchup and soups that
contain lycopene, an antioxidant that can help lower the risk of
certain cancers and heart diseases; and vitamin-fortified cereals,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this growth is being fueled by aging baby boomers.
Nowadays, folks don't just want to live longer, they want to live
better. Between 1980 and 2030, the number of Americans 65 and older
will double. And if they can get vitamins and nutrients in foods
instead of pills, they're going to opt for those foods.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BRIAN MAYNARD
</P>
<P>
   Director of integrated marketing, KitchenAid
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for `smart appliances' that will use more computer
technology and become more interactive. For instance, refrigerators
will be able to read universal product codes so they will know what
is inside and will be able to tell you what you need. Your
refrigerator will be able to call you at work to alert you that the
power has gone out. There will also be a lot more flexibility in
storage space, with areas specifically designed for, say, fresh
herbs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see more small appliances that can do more
than one thing so it doesn't take up so much counter space,'' he
adds. ``We have a food processor that doubles as a citrus press.
``Microwaves and conventional ovens will be combined.
</P>
<P>
   As far as kitchen colors go, ``metallics like copper and
stainless steel will be popular, as well as faux finishes like faux
marble. We have also developed a new finish called chameleon that
changes colors depending on the light and where you are standing.''

 &HT;    A century of food: The evolution of eating well
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE 1900s
</P>
<P>
   While the huddled masses boiled cabbage over wood stoves, the
rich lived it up on oysters Rockefeller, salmon, beef filet, fine
wines and molded ice cream desserts. Culinary master Auguste
Escoffier distilled classic French cooking techniques into texts
that became bibles for chefs. John Harvey Kellogg, C.W. Post and
Wilbur Atwater and others pushed healthful eating. Kellogg created
cornflakes, Post invented Grape-Nuts, and Atwater introduced the
concept of calories. Americans got their first taste of peanut
butter, hamburgers, iced tea and ice cream cones. Fannie Farmer
opened a cooking school and wrote a cookbook using standardized
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the 1900s: Hershey's bar, hot fudge sundae, Karo syrup,
Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Royal Crown Cola, Pepsi, Dr Pepper, Hebrew
National frankfurters, A-1 Steak Sauce, French's mustard, Animal
Crackers, tea bags, Ovaltine, Wesson oil, chili powder, self-rising
flour, canned peas, creamed corn, canned tuna, Campbell's Pork &AMP;
Beans.
</P>
<P>
   1910-1920
</P>
<P>
   Railroads and Model T's brought people into cities. Waves of
immigrants brought with them goulash, spaghetti, kebabs and other
ethnic dishes. Every man ate his lunch at cafeterias, diners and
hot dog stands. The canning industry offered new convenience.
Crisco arrived to take the place of difficult-to-get lard during
World War I. The beginning of self-service grocery stores changed
the way people shopped. Housewives thrilled over gas stoves.
Chicken a la king, crab Louis, fettuccine Alfredo, hush puppies,
vichyssoise and chop suey were popular recipes of the day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New from 1910 to 1920: Nathans Famous Coney Island Hot Dogs,
Hellmann's Mayonnaise, Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour, Oreos, Lorna
Doones, Moon Pies, GooGoo Clusters, A&AMP;P, Piggly Wiggly, Lifesavers,
Whitman's Sampler, fruit cocktail, the electric mixer, Contadina
tomato sauce, Pyrex baking dishes, free-flowing salt, Domino sugar,
Mazola corn oil, Quaker Puffed Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cocktails we drink today were developed during
Prohibition, which went into effect in January 1920. As restaurants
that sold liquor closed their front doors, they opened speakeasies
in the back. Another effect of Prohibition was the development of
candy bars because chocolate was thought to counteract the bitter
taste of bathtub gin. Housewives who were listening to the ``Betty
Crocker Cooking School of the Air'' delighted in refrigerators with
tiny freezer sections, pop-up toasters and stainless steel knives.
Perhaps the most welcome development of the 1920s was sliced bread.
Popular recipes included Swiss steak, spaghetti, heavenly hash,
chiffon pies and Caesar salad. In October 1929 the stock market
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '20s: Kool-Aid, Sanka decaffeinated coffee, Gerber
canned baby food, White Castle, Velveeta, Welch's grape jelly,
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, General Mills and General Foods,
Popsicles, Howard Johnsons, Ruby Red grapefruit, Hormel canned ham,
Rice Krispies, Birdseye quick-frozen vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The1930s
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring 20s were just a memory as Americans made do in the
face of the Depression. People stayed home and socialized by way of
potluck dinners, teas, bridge parties and county fairs. The repeal
of Prohibition near the end of 1933 led to the re-opening of
restaurants and bars. Cookbooks beginning with ``The Better Homes
and Gardens Cookbook'' and then the ``Joy of Cooking,'' along with
numerous radio programs and newspaper columns, were dedicated to
cooking with an emphasis on thrift, stretching and the art of
disguise. Macaroni and cheese, chili with lots of beans, Spam and
soups were on most people's tables. An ad in 1939 summed up the
decade: ``Hitler Threatens Europe _ But Betty Havens' Husband's
Boss Is Coming to Dinner and That's What Really Counts.''

</P>
<P>
   The 1940s
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the 1940s were marked by food shortages and
World War II rationing. Many staples were limited, including meat,
sugar, coffee, fish, butter and cheese. American cooks rose to the
challenge and used their ingenuity to stretch, save and substitute.
The end of the war brought unbridled optimism and a booming
economy. Americans couldn't get enough steak. Convenience foods
gained popularity. Continental cuisine and gourmet cooking took
hold. We ended the decade on a high note as beef stroganoff,
lobster thermidor and crepes suzette appeared on our tables.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '40s: M&AMP;Ms, Dannon yogurt, cake mixes, La Choy
Chinese foods, Chiquita bananas, Cheerios, French's instant mashed
potatoes, Minute Maid frozen orange juice, Reynolds Wrap, V-8,
Cheetos, Maxwell House instant coffee, the General Electric garbage
disposal, Toll House cookies, Chicago-style deep-dish pizza,
electric dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s
</P>
<P>
   The '50s are etched in our minds as a utopia compared to the
tumultous social changes that were to come. Father could be found
in the back yard, barbecuing (sales of backyard cooking
paraphernalia hit $30 million) while mother, in high heels and
pearls, was in her modern kitchen, stocking her side-by-side
refrigerator freezer with TV dinners. (Swanson's turkey, stuffing,
gravy, peas and sweet potatoes cost 98 cents.) Home cooks became
infatuated with convenience cooking. Cooking with bottled, canned
and packaged foods became gourmet. Dishes like crab and cheese
souffles were unapologetically made with Velveeta. American
supermarkets were the envy of the world and visited by heads of
state such as Queen Elizabeth and Nikita Khruschev. The fast food
industry was born. McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, Church's, Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Denny's, and
International House of Pancakes all got started in the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '50s: Kraft presliced processed cheese, Duncan
Hines cake mix, Mrs. Paul's frozen fish sticks, Butterball turkey,
Sweet 'n' Low, Special K, Rice-a-Roni, Haagen-Dazs, Cheez Whiz,
Lipton onion soup mix, Eggo frozen waffles, instant tea, Tropicana
orange and grapefruit juices, Carnation instant nonfat dry milk,
peanut M&AMP;Ms, Tang.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s
</P>
<P>
   First lady Jacqueline Kennedy raised the culinary bar by hiring
a French chef for the White House. Julia Child helped us get
comfortable with French cuisine. As we developed a fondness for
fondue, the 1964 World's Fair in New York further broadened our
palates. Gazpacho and Belgian waffles were all the rage. We
discovered kiwi fruit. By 1968, the Immigration Act brought a flood
of immigrants to our shores and ethnic restaurants began cropping
up. In Buffalo, N.Y., chicken wings made their debut. By the end of
the decade, the youth counterculture had begun a resurgence of
interest in vegetarianism, brown rice, macrobiotic diets and health
foods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '60s: Shake 'n' Bake, Coffee-Mate, Sprite, Tab and
Diet Pepsi, Charlie the Tuna, frozen pie crust, Pop Tarts, Cremora
nondairy creamer, Carnation Instant Breakfast, Cool Whip, Total
cereal, Apple Jacks, Kellogg's Product 19 cereal, Gatorade,
Pringles potato chips, Taster's Choice freeze-dried instant coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of quiche doctored with anything and everything
lasted through the decade. Crockpots were welcome appliances that
let Mom have a hot meal on the table after a day at work. Nouvelle
cuisine (``the new cooking'') _ simple, light fare made with the
freshest of ingredients _ was the decade's defining trend. While
hip foodies were talking about arugula and Belgian endive, everyone
else flocked to salad bars that were light on the new greens but
well stocked with iceberg lettuce, shredded cheeses, bacon bits and
fatty dressings. Granola became mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '70s: Gourmet popcorn, Starbucks, Perrier, Snapple,
Herbal teas, Cup-O-Noodles, Ben &AMP; Jerry's, lite beer, Stove Top
Stuffing, Hamburger Helper, Food &AMP; Wine magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s
</P>
<P>
   Bon Appetit magazine dubbed the 1980s the ``Bonfire of the
Foodies.'' Think junk bonds, the Trumps, Nancy Reagan, credit
cards, status food and status restaurants. Roasted whole garlic,
especially with mashed potatoes, picked up speed. So did blackened
everything. Martha Stewart (not yet an empire) published her first
cookbook. People fell in love with their microwaves as actual
cooking gave way to heat-and-eat meals _ except on weekends. Then,
in 1987, the Dow Jones tanked, and meatloaf was back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '80s: Lean Cuisine frozen dinners, Scramblers egg
substitute, Boboli pizza crusts, Fruit Roll-Ups, Tofutti, microwave
popcorn, Bud Light.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s
</P>
<P>
   Anything that was low-fat or fat-free got our attention. Even
fat free fat in the form of Olestra was introduced. Vegetarian
dishes gained in popularity. Still, we indulged ourselves with
steaks, butter, cheese and rich desserts, partly as a backlash to a
steady diet of negative and often conflicting health and nutrition
news. The computer became a kitchen appliance, with some 20 million
recipes floating around in cyberspace. Interest in ethnic food of
all types exploded. Mixing and matching was dubbed ``fusion.'' When
we didn't feel like cooking, we sought out a ``home meal
replacement'' _ the buzzword for take-out meals. Food got its own
24-hour cable channel. Focaccia, risotto, fruit salsas, grilled sea
bass, portobello mushrooms and organic produce were on menus
everywhere. Cool designer water was hot, hot, hot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New in the '90s: Harvest Burger, SnackWell's cookies and
crackers, V-8 Splash, Fruitopia, Progresso Healthy Classic soups,
Healthy Choice breakfast cereals, Promise Ultra nonfat margarine,
Stouffer's Homestyle entrees, Wow! potato chips (made with the fat
substitute olestra), Fresh Express trimmed and washed salad greens
in bags, Kraft vitamin E-enhanced salad dressing.

   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-IOWA-REVIEW (Des Moines, Iowa) _ A little-noticed
reality of Campaign 2000 is magnified in Iowa but has set the tone
for the entire political season: Even in the face of relentless
sniping from their rivals and from interest groups, all major
candidates have refused to swerve from the middle of the road on
nettlesome social issues. The situation is most striking in Iowa
because this state has a storied history of driving candidates to
the extremes. By Richard L. Berke. (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CASH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Record amounts have poured
into national political committees. Record sums have been raised by
most senators and congressmen and governors. Record amounts have
flowed to leadership committees, state party organizations and
political action committees. The 2000 elections could cost a total
of $3 billion, an amount that far exceeds the estimated $2.1
billion spent on the 1996 elections. By Don Van Natta. (Moving in
the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-DIARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Diary excerpts by Zalpa
Bersanova, a Chechen graduate in history from Moscow State
University and an aspiring author, who recently returned to Grozny
and became a refugee. (Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INCOME-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a time of plenty, why are the
poor still so poor and becoming even poorer? The problem is
substantial and persistent enough that some analysts, particularly
on the left, now see it not just as a social problem but as a
potential threat to the economy's long-term prospects. And it is
striking enough that politicians across the spectrum feel compelled
to address it as they set out their election-year agendas. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SC-FLAG-REVIEW (Columbia, S.C.) _ To many South Carolinians, the
Confederate flag debate is not about slavery vs. Southern heritage,
but is about whether the rest of the country should keep out of
South Carolina's business. This stubbornness is of no surprise to
students of South Carolina history, who have seen it throughout the
centuries. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTHAND-CANDIDATES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Left-handed persons
comprise only about 10 percent of the population, but they are
often overrepresented among prominent presidential candidates: Al
Gore, Bill Bradley, John McCain, Steve Forbes (and, in previous
campaigns, Bill Clinton, George Bush the elder, Ross Perot, Gerald
Ford). The phenomenon might be explained by some new findings about
handedness, psychology and the brain. By Melissa Roth.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-ADS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the FDA relaxed its rules to
permit drug companies to pitch products directly to consumers on
TV, the viewing public has been taken on a short course through
pharmacy school, Madison Avenue style. As the multi-million dollar
media blitz has escalated, so has the criticism, from drug safety
experts and irritated physicians complain that the flood of ads
will misinform consumers and put undue pressure on doctors to write
unnecessary, or inappropriate, prescriptions. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-COINS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When it comes to their money,
Americans hate _ pardon the pun _ change. More than 75 percent of
Americans, according to one recent poll, oppose eliminating the $1
bill in favor of any dollar coin. The nation's conservatism about
money is embedded in its history. The result is that U.S. money
doesn't change much. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ARKAN-REVIEW (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The murder of Arkan,
a Serbian patriot and indicted war criminal, was treated here as a
cultural event, and in fact there may be no better recent window
into this land's curious political culture. For Arkan and his death
combined the peculiarly Serbian worlds of mobsters and police,
sports stars and starlets, businessmen and politicians. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLARIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ecuador has joined a growing list
of more than two dozen countries, the largest of them Panama, that
use the dollar as their official currency, as well as the people in
more than 50 other countries who unofficially put their trust in
U.S. currency. Questions arise about how many economically battered
countries can take refuge behind the U.S. dollar without having an
impact on the U.S. economy itself. By Anthony DePalma.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ With mounting intensity, China's leaders have railed
about the mortal dangers that smuggling and corruption pose to
society and Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as details emerge about the largest smuggling scandal yet _
a conspiracy that apparently involved dozens of party, police and
banking officials, the wife of Beijing's powerful party chief,
virtually the entire customs department of a major seaport and a
flamboyant corporate leader who has vanished _ the basis for those
fears is becoming clearer.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the sprawling syndicate smuggled billions of
dollars' worth of cars, oil and industrial materials through the
bustling southeastern port of Xiamen, evading huge sums in taxes,
according to officials familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   This was no pick-up scheme to sneak the odd container past a
customs booth, but a systematic corruption of the port to allow
rivers of goods to pass through illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which the central authorities began investigating last
fall, has to be embarrassing and sobering for President Jiang
Zemin, who has spearheaded the anti-corruption crusade. But even
more, it suggests critical weaknesses in the Communist Party and
its ability to govern the vast country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a cooperative, well-integrated operation,'' said Ding
Xueliang, a Chinese-born expert on corruption issues, noting the
apparent suborning of Xiamen's entire customs branch and the
complicity of the police and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law and party discipline became irrelevant in a whole city,''
said Ding, a research associate at Australia National University
who is now conducting research in Hong Kong. ``That's got to be the
most worrying thing for the central leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Xiamen case is only the most extensive of several recent
scandals involving large numbers of officials who cooperated in
crime, Ding said. ``These large criminal schemes will destabilize
the political and social situation in China much more than one or
two dissidents in the streets with slogans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The country's top leaders have stayed publicly mum about the
investigation, which is being carried out by hundreds of agents who
were specially sent from Beijing and have taken over two hotels in
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few hints about this smuggling case in Fujian
province, on the coast across from Taiwan, have been reported in
the state-controlled media here.
</P>
<P>
   But too many people have been detained or otherwise affected for
the inquiry to remain a secret. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji described
the giant investigation in a recent internal party speech, an
official said Friday, while accounts from Hong Kong newspapers have
appeared on Chinese Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, officials in Xiamen and Beijing have privately
confirmed to foreign reporters many startling details about a case
that has Beijing's political cognoscenti buzzing with speculation
about where it may lead.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials in Beijing confirmed Friday that this month, as
investigators closed in, a deputy mayor of Xiamen, Lan Fu, and his
wife fled the country. The Chinese authorities believe that they
flew to Australia, and officials said they had asked for their
arrest through Interpol.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Embassy here said it had no knowledge of Lan's
whereabouts or of requests for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official in Fujian was reportedly arrested for
helping Lan and his wife flee.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in Hong Kong newspapers, since September
all middle-ranking and senior officials in Xiamen have been
forbidden to travel outside China without special permission.
</P>
<P>
   Among other senior officials reportedly accused in the case are
another deputy mayor of Xiamen; the deputy chief of police for
Fujian province; the chief of police in Fujian's provincial
capital, Fuzhou; the Xiamen customs chief; two of Xiamen's deputy
party secretaries, and three senior bank managers in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suspects have already been held for months for
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent high-profile smuggling cases, some officials
convicted as ringleaders were given death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of the wife of the Beijing Communist Party
secretary, Jia Qinglin, who is also a member of the party's
policy-making Politburo, is especially embarrassing and sensitive
for the top leaders. Jia was formerly party secretary in Fujian
province, and his wife, Lin Youfang, held powerful posts in
Fujian's economic planning establishment and a provincial
government trading corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Jia had been picked by Jiang to help clean up the image of
Beijing, tarnished by the rampant corruption of the city's former
mayor and party secretary, who in 1998 was sentenced to 16 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said Friday that in an effort to salvage his
career, Jia recently divorced his wife, but this could not be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As the top political official of China's capital, Jia presided
over the huge parade on the 50th birthday of the People's Republic
on Oct. 1. His political future is now unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the center of the scandal is Lai Changxing, president
of a corporation called Yuanhua Group, which carried out most of
the illegal trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lai had cut a large figure in Xiamen, sponsoring the local
soccer team and investing in a giant office and hotel complex with
a planned 88-story center. He bought an expensive apartment and
company offices in Hong Kong. And, investigators say, he bought the
support of the Xiamen customs authorities and the police for his
smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have closed down the Yuanhua company, and at
some point last fall Lai disappeared, presumably into a secret life
abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Jiang has not spoken publicly about the Xiamen case,
spreading word about the scandal has led to new scrutiny of his
Jan. 14 speech to the Central Disciplinary Inspection Committee,
the party's internal investigations body, which was published the
next day in the party's newspaper, People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading cadres must be strictly supervised,'' he said.
``Leading cadres who are found to have violated discipline and the
law must certainly be strictly investigated and handled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more senior the cadre, the more famous the person, the
more rigorously cases of violation of discipline and law must be
investigated and handled,'' he said. ``No matter who they are, no
matter what their seniority, they should be punished in whatever
way is appropriate.''

 &HT;    Michigan files suit against Home Depot for discrimination
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state of Michigan has filed a racial
discrimination complaint against Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Department of Civil Rights follows a lawsuit
filed against the company earlier this month by employees at a
store near Detroit. Twelve black employees in Southfield, Mich.,
allege they faced discrimination in hiring and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The state department said it is negotiating an agreement with
the Atlanta-based home improvement retailer. If a resolution cannot
be reached, the state will launch a formal investigation into the
company's employment practices, said Rachel Nusser, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot met with department officials Thursday and plans to
discuss a potential agreement Feb. 4, Nusser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuation of our discussions with the (department)
doesn't mean that we believe discrimination has occurred in the
Southfield store,'' said Faye Wilson, senior vice president of
value initiatives at Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic that the issue with the store will be
resolved quickly, as we share the same interests as the
(department),'' said Wilson, who is also a company director.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs originally filed a complaint against Home Depot
with the state last year, but later decided to pursue the matter in
court, Nusser said. They are seeking $1.12 billion in damages. The
state's complaint was filed separately on behalf of Michigan
citizens, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a group of institutional investors filed a
resolution to get details on the retailer's employment of
minorities and women. Home Depot plans to release a report on
minority hiring prior to the company's annual shareholder meeting
May 31.

POINTS WON'T COME SO EASILY FOR RAMS VS. VIKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ If anything is certain about Sunday's NFC
Championship game between the Bucs and the Rams _ aside from the
decibel level inside the TWA Dome being as loud as a fleet of TWA
jets revving for takeoff _ it is that the Rams will not score as
quickly as they did last Sunday against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to imply that Tampa Bay can hold St. Louis's
explosive offense down as it did to Washington last Saturday, when
it put the clamp on the Redskins' No. 2 offense in the league and
held it to a mere 157 yards of offense. It's just that the Rams may
have to eat up their yards in dibs and dabs rather in huge chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay offensive lineman Frank Middleton was right in saying
``The Vikings can't stop anybody,'' scoffing at the 49 points St.
Louis scored, but it is more the style of the Tampa Bay defense
that could slow the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Vikings, Tampa Bay likes to play a zone pass defense
much of the time ``and if that means we're going to have to throw
underneath it, then we'll do what we have to do,'' said St. Louis
quarterback Kurt Warner. ``We'll adjust to what we see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's secondary coach, Herman Edwards, disdains man-to-man
coverage ``because I like our guys to see the ball when it's coming
at them.'' In man-to-man coverage, defensive backs often have their
backs to the ball until the last instant.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has the league's best defense statistically and Warner
said the Bucs' defense is similar to others he has seen this year,
``except they have better talent.'' But the Rams have the best
offense in the league and Warner, displaying the confident attitude
of all these Rams, warned, ``I can still improve and play better. I
haven't played the perfect game (this season).''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay usually pays the most basic, vanilla pass defense in
pro football, the ``Cover 2'' _ a zone defense with both safeties
often deep to prevent the long ball. Unlike the Patriot cornerbacks
who usually pressed receivers at the line, for example, Tampa Bay
corners Donnie Abraham and Ronde Barber often play well off the
ball, allowing the short pass but preventing a deeper one.
</P>
<P>
   (The Vikings, by contrast, played football's macho pass defense,
an aggressive bump-and-run and were quickly burned on the game's
first play when St. Louis wide receiver Isaac Bruce hauled in a
77-yard TD pass from Warner. It's unlikely the Bucs will give up
any 77-yard pass plays.)
</P>
<P>
   All this might be considered a Tampa Bay blessing if the Rams
did not have one particular player in their backfield _ running
back Marshall Faulk. Faulk truly has the sixth sense of knowing
where all would-be tacklers are, and he is sure to be sent out for
pass plays that might be short plays initially, but turn into
longer ones because of his unique talent.
</P>
<P>
   When a play is sent into the huddle, ``We all look at each other
and it's like, `Whoever gets open first gets the ball,' '' said
Faulk. ``It makes no difference who gets the ball. It's just that
we score and we win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' offensive philosophy is simple. As offensive
coordinator Mike Martz explained it, ``Go as fast as we can and
pressure them.'' And Warner said that his greatest legacy from the
Arena Football League is the realization ``that you have to score
every time you have the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Rams coach Dick Vermeil put it, ``There's going to be a
real clash in personalities and profiles'' in Sunday's game. Tampa
Bay ``forces you to play a more conservative game because of the
style they play. They eliminate the big play and you get very few
big plays. They force you to go into a more conservative and
patient attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's huge handicap, of course, is that it can't score
easily, so its defense must play close to a perfect game to have
any chance. And if only Green Bay was able to score as many as 26
points against them (the Vikings scored 21 and 17 points in the two
games against Tampa Bay), the Tampa Bay defense is not as
dominating on the road as it is in Tampa. Even more, it is possible
to run on the Bucs and, in Faulk, the Rams have the best runner in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Points will come Sunday, but they come more slowly.

HOUSTON DOCTORS TAKE ISSUE WITH PLAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In ``Wit,'' the patient, not her doctor, is the hero.
The tough, uncompromising poetry scholar is dying of ovarian
cancer. She finds herself in the harsh theater of a teaching
hospital, at the mercy of physicians who see her as nothing more
than data for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The story is profoundly moving, but how close is it to the
reality of cancer treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Five cancer doctors who attended the Houston performance, which
opened earlier this week at the Alley Theatre, say they empathized
with the patient, professor Vivian Bearing, and identified with the
pitfalls of their profession _ but they took issue with the
playwright's unflattering portrayal of physicians and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient was familiar to me in many ways. I do high-dose
chemotherapy for patients with ovarian cancer. Many of the people
who come to me are highly educated, strong-willed, that are put in
this position of feeling like they're relinquishing power and
control,'' said Dr. Michelle Donato, bone-marrow transplant
specialist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the play reflect how patients feel? It probably does.
Does it reflect medical reality? It probably does not. That's what
made me wince.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Edson's play won the Pulitzer Prize in 1999. The
doctors were invited to the play by the Houston Chronicle and asked
to discuss their reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Gershenson, chairman of gynecologic oncology at M.D.
Anderson, found the play ``a little disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was a caricature of reality for what we see at M.D.
Anderson. I think they were trying to portray the attending
physician as pretty insensitive, focused on research and not the
patient herself,'' he said. ``The fellow was sort of a bumbling
idiot who had no bedside manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life doctors also found flaws with the play's portrayal
of aggressive chemotherapy, which they say has come a long way from
the grueling experience depicted in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Chang, a Baylor College of Medicine oncologist
specializing in breast cancer, pointed out that new cancer drugs
are better tolerated by the body, with fewer side effects.
Patient-controlled pain medication is readily available, as are
drugs to control nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel bad about is people leaving (the play) will have
all these misconceptions of cancer and cancer therapy, which I
don't think is a good thing,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patients are up, showered, makeup on, dressed, every single
day, and they walk the hallways, and they are committed to their
treatment,'' added Donato. ``They're not in bed vomiting. It's not
as scary as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the script provided food for thought for doctors
in cutting-edge medicine, who must balance science and the thirst
for new discoveries with sensitivity and patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time. If you're telling someone they have a
new diagnosis of cancer, you can't just spend 10 minutes, hand on
the doorknob, and leave the room,'' said Dr. Roy Herbst, a
researcher and specialist in cancers of the head, neck and lungs at
M.D. Anderson. He no longer answers patient questions through
e-mail because of the potential for sounding insensitive or
impersonal. ``You have to make sure they realize you care. ... So
they don't feel like a (laboratory) mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to learn how to break bad news,'' Gershenson said.
``It doesn't come naturally. One of the hardest questions is,
`What's my prognosis and how much longer do I have to live?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of M.D. Anderson, said the lesson
doctors learn from their teachers and through experience is that
every patient wants a different answer to that question. The
physician's job, he said, is to figure out what the patient wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want hope. That's a uniform thing,'' he said. ``Some
people want to know `72 percent are cured and the average life span
of those who aren't cured is 13 1/2 months.' Some people don't want
to hear those kinds of numbers. They want to know we've seen people
cured with this approach. That's enough for that patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato said, ``It's hard to be honest, but the patients do
appreciate it. Most of them want to know what you know. Doesn't
make it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbst said, ``People are always very angry with the first
doctor they've seen. `I don't want to go back to him. He said I was
going to die.' Maybe it came across that way because it was the
first time. It's an evolving process. People have to come to grips
with their diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their criticism of the play's depiction of modern
medicine, the doctors said the performance prompted
self-examination. Gershenson said, ``I think any physician watching
that play would really reflect on, am I like that? I think all of
us at one time or another see that, because medicine is a microcosm
of society and we have insensitive people and we have caring
people. For sure, I looked for myself in all those characters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This play was good for doctors, I think,'' Donato added.
``Maybe when I (go on rounds) tomorrow, I'll make sure I was not
like any of the doctors I saw in the play. I may take a little bit
more time. It's a reality check. I may take a few extra moments
tomorrow.''

BUSH APPEAL TO WOMEN VOTERS APPEARS TO BE TAKING HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ For many Democrats, the scariest thing about
Texas Governor George W. Bush's tax-cut plan is that he says it's
aimed at single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest job in America is to be a single mom, making
$20,000 a year,'' Bush declared at a recent Rotary Club lunch where
he promised that as president, he would reduce the struggling
woman's marginal income-tax rate and ``knock down her tollbooth to
the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a single mother becoming the poster child for a
presidential candidate in a party that typically defines family in
two-parent terms is remarkable enough. Moreover, it signals Bush
isn't ceding the Democrats' usual advantage with women voters, but
has a strategy to appeal directly to women on issues and to
contrast himself as a strong, moral man determined to restore
integrity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush is having some success. Today, with the nominating
process about to begin, the gender gap that has vexed Republican
presidential candidates and twice elected Bill Clinton isn't
bothering Bush. National polls consistently show him beating Vice
President Al Gore and leading him among likely women voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's problems with women persist,'' said a report from the
Pew Research Center, which released a poll this week that has Bush
defeating Gore 51 percent to 39 percent overall, ahead of the vice
president 49 percent to 42 percent among women and 54 percent to 35
percent with men.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a Gore pollster, acknowledges that the vice
president is not getting the benefit of a gender gap, and the
reason is that ``cross-pressured women'' _ defined as those who
tend to agree with Democratic positions on issues but are disgusted
with Clinton's immorality and his abuse of his office _ ``favor
Bush pretty solidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are the soccer moms of the 2000 elections,'' said
Lake, noting that women who would be inclined to support Gore are
holding the administration's scandals with campaign donations and
Monica S. Lewinsky against him. ``They will be the decisive women
voters this cycle and the key to that election.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake's latest data show that cross-pressured women make up 17
percent of all likely voters. Unlike 1996's soccer moms, who mostly
were married, upper middle-class, and lived in a suburb,
cross-pressured women span a wider range of income and education
levels, Lake said. Both Bush and Gore are targeting them as they
campaign to improve schools, expand day care, create economic
opportunity for the working class, and bring family values to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Wood, an unemployed dietitian, a married mother of two,
and an undecided voter, attended the Rotary lunch here and listened
intently as Bush talked about his ``compassionate agenda'' and the
joy of being part of a family of ``wonderful women'' _ his wife,
twin daughters, and mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went on in Washington over the last couple of years
really has colored the image of the candidate I want to vote for
this time around,'' said Wood, who lives in Exeter, N.H. ``He has
to be moral and ethical, absolutely. My decision hinges much more
on who the candidate is than where he stands on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of American men and women now believe
Democrats are more capable than Republicans of handling almost
every issue, from the economy to the environment, from crime to
Social Security. The problem for the Democratic candidate, whether
it is Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, is that times
are so good that issues probably won't be as important as character
when voters choose the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more interested in a change of leadership than a
change of direction,'' said William Schneider, a political analyst
at the American Enterprise Institute. ``They want a new face,
someone who is very un-Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a new face but from a familiar family, and many women
remember his parents, President Bush and his wife, Barbara, as
dignified and respectable. ``I think we need to get a stable family
in the White House,'' said Amy Koch, who attended a recent Bush
town meeting in Londonderry. ``I'm undecided, but I lean toward
Bush because I liked his father.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP pollster Linda DiVall says Bush may draw from his father's
popularity, but he has developed a distinctive persona to win
women's votes that ``is not prototypical of Republican presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bush, women see someone who has children, who is younger,
and who understands the time pressures and cultural demands they
face every day,'' DiVall said. ``Women relate to him as an open
guy, maybe not the genius of the class, but someone who won't
embarrass them or let them down when it comes to the
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Bush may be smartly wooing women, but the
flirtation won't last. When the time comes to settle down with a
presidential choice _ and women typically make up their minds later
than men _ it will be with the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now George Bush is all sizzle. When women begin to focus
on his record and find out that he is more conservative than
compassionate, they will move away from him, and it will fix the
problem very quickly,'' said Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's
List, a political action committee that raises money for Democratic
women candidates who favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, who conducts polls for the Nelson Rockefeller
Center at Dartmouth College, says Bush definitely lost some support
among Republican women in New Hampshire as his closest rival,
Arizona Senator John McCain, became more well-known. Between
October and January, Bush's support among women dropped from 47
percent to 36 percent, while McCain's surged from 26 percent to 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Dartmouth Poll shows Bradley holding a big lead over
Gore with men _ 56 percent to 38 percent. The candidates get about
equal support from women.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent town meeting in Salem, N.H., Gore reminded women
that he has deep feminist roots _ his mother worked her way through
Vanderbilt Law School to become one of its first female graduates _
and as a legislator and vice president he championed many women's
issues, including pay equity, abortion rights, and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress we have made for women's rights in the last
century is only the beginning of the progress we will make in this
century,'' Gore promised.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Haynes, who advises the vice president on women's issues,
knows there are some cross-pressured women Gore will never win
over. ``But many women have yet to hear the vice president,
recognize his accomplishments, and remember this election is about
the future, not about reliving the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Carolyn Keilig is grappling with that. The Hopkinton,
N.H., pastor voted for Gore in the 1988 primary here and would vote
for him again if she could get over feeling he was tainted by his
association with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not fair to do that to Al Gore,'' Keilig said as
she waited for McCain to show up for a town meeting, ``and I'm
trying to separate who he is from who he worked for. But the
president lied. And if you don't have integrity, nothing else
really matters.''

AUSTRIA'S RULING COALITION COLLAPSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Austria's old ruling coalition, reunited just this past
Wednesday after three months of wrangling, abruptly fell apart
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Viktor Klima, head of the labor-oriented Social
Democratic party, which has 33 percent of the seats in Parliament,
said he would try to form a minority government with a cabinet of
non-party members, but the collapse of his talks with the
business-oriented Austrian People's Party was seen as a national
embarrassment. The unusual coalition of leftist and conservative
parties has ruled Austria since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse puts the right-wing Freedom Party, led by Joerg
Haider, in a powerful position. It came in second in the October
elections, beating the Austrian People's Party by a mere 415 votes,
but has been squeezed out of negotiations because President Thomas
Klestil feared Austria would become an international pariah with
Haider in a coalition government. Haider is best known abroad for
his anti-immigrant stance and remarks he made years ago that were
taken as sympathy for Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Haider's party could form a majority government with either
of the other parties, the ``reds'' and ``blacks.'' Both have
conservative elements in them that are pushing for such a deal
because they say voters are tired of the bickering and
indecisiveness of the current leaders. Or, if new elections are
forced, opinion polls suggest that frustrated voters may even give
victory to Haider, who has tripled his party's showing since he
took it over 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But one political analyst, Hans Rauscher of Die Presse
newspaper, suggested that a more likely scenario is that Haider
will sit by and let the Social Democrats form a minority
government.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever government emerges, it will face a $5-billion deficit
in the national budget. The shortfall, recently discovered, must be
made up by spending cuts or tax hikes because Austria is required
to match the fiscal discipline of all European Union countries
converting their currency to the euro. Negotiations between the
reds and blacks foundered on how to make those cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, since the coalition was announced on Wednesday, the
Social Democrats' labor allies refused to accept one money-saving
proposal _ raising the minimum retirement age to 62 _ and the
People's Party demanded that the reds surrender the position of
finance minister to them so there would be no more $5-billion
slip-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Any party in power when those unavoidable budget cuts are made,
Rauscher pointed out, would be blamed by the voters. Haider may
have more to gain by staying out of government; an unpopular
minority government can be readily turned out by Parliament and new
elections forced sometime when Austrians have adjusted to the cuts.
Even by comfortable European standards, the Austrians enjoy
generous social and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider will stay in Carinthia until he's ready to be
chancellor,'' Rauscher predicted, naming the conservative southern
province of which Haider is governor.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of talks two days after they were declared a
success was seen as a blunder by Klima, who became head of
government in January 1997 after a career spent largely in
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian stock market fell on Friday, and The Associated
Press quoted one trader who blamed it on the chaos in government
and pessimism about a weak government; he suggested that investors
would prefer an alliance between the conservative Austrian People's
Party and Haider's party.

DOCTORS SAY BRADLEY HEART AILMENT LOW RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as Bill Bradley's heart is basically sound, which his
doctors say is the case, his more-frequent recurrences of an
irregular heartbeat are not worrisome and should not bear on his
ability to campaign or serve in office, heart specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his episodes of atrial fibrillation have become more
numerous _ and campaign stress may or may not be to blame _ Bradley
remains at low risk for any complications of the condition, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation, a glitch in the heart's electrical system
that causes the upper chambers to beat out of their normal rhythm,
is of most concern when it coexists with other cardiac problems,
like valve defects, coronary artery disease, or high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bradley's heart is reportedly normal and the cause of
his episodes isn't clear, his condition is called ``lone atrial
fibrillation.'' In cases like these the risk is low that the
fibrillation, or chaotic beating of the atria, will generate a clot
that could in turn cause a stroke. The only symptoms a patient
typically notices are an uncomfortable flutter in the chest and, in
some people, fatigue or exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's revelation this week that he has had four more
episodes since the one reported in December ``doesn't really change
the picture,'' said Dr. Deeb Salem, a cardiologist and chairman of
medicine at New England Medical Center &UR;  &LR; in Boston. ``The assumption
is that if they worked him up and found no underlying disease, it's
just a nuisance problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Zimetbaum, a cardiologist who researches atrial
fibrillation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston,
concurred. ``There are a lot of athletes and people in high-profile
jobs'' who have frequent or chronic atrial fibrillation, he said.
``I have patients who run marathons in atrial fibrillation.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treat arrhythmias like Bradley's with a variety of drugs
that can squelch irregular heartbeats, but Salem said that most
work well only 60 to 70 percent of the time. He said that he
doesn't prescribe the drug Bradley is taking, called Procanbid,
because ``I think there are other drugs that are more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   When atrial fibrillation continues despite drug treatment,
doctors may want to give a blood-thinner, like Coumadin, to prevent
clots. Even if that should happen in Bradley's case _ which would
mean that he'd have to have his clotting time monitored and perhaps
modify his diet _ Salem still didn't think that should disqualify
him from serving as president.
</P>
<P>
   Salem said that campaign stress, which may cause the body to
secrete more adrenaline, could be a factor in Bradley's recent
bouts of ``afib.'' Zimetbaum said, however, that ``we don't find
that stress per se'' is clearly linked to episodes of atrial
fibrillation. ``It's not uncommon for people to have storms of
it,'' he added, ``and everybody has different triggers.''

COMMENTARY: `IMPOSING ON THEM A BADGE OF INFERIORITY'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On May 17, 1942, Elmer Henderson, a federal government
employee, took a Southern Railway train from Washington to Atlanta.
The trip was on government business.
</P>
<P>
   As the train passed through Virginia, Henderson went to the
dining car for dinner. He was black. Two tables at the end of the
car were for blacks _ unless white passengers needed them, as in
this case they had. One seat was empty, but the steward would not
let Henderson sit with whites. He went without dinner _ and
complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The ICC decided that Henderson had been treated unfairly. The
Southern Railway then issued new dining car rules. Two tables at
the end were reserved exclusively for blacks, and separated from
the others by a curtain.
</P>
<P>
   That segregation rule satisfied the ICC and a federal court, but
not Henderson. He appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At that point something happened that made the Henderson case an
engine of history. The ICC's decision had been defended in court by
the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. But now the case
was considered by the solicitor general's office, which handles all
government business in the Supreme Court. There it was handled by a
lawyer of unusual skill and vision, an assistant to the solicitor
general for many years, Philip Elman.
</P>
<P>
   Elman urged the solicitor general, Philip Perlman, to tell the
Supreme Court that the dining car segregation was indefensible _ to
confess error, as lawyers say. Perlman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was October 1949 when the government entered the case on
Henderson's side. Not many remember what the racial system was in
the South then. Public schools and colleges were totally
segregated. So were restaurants, hotels, even cemeteries. In many
areas blacks could not vote. Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme
Court decision upholding ``separate but equal'' facilities, was the
law; the prospect of overturning it seemed to most people remote.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, Elman wrote a brief that tackled the
legal and factual premises of segregation head on. I looked at the
brief the other day, and it is a remarkable document. Here are some
passages from its 66 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segregation of Negroes, as practiced in this country, is
universally understood as imposing on them a badge of
inferiority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The curtain which fences Negroes off from all other diners
exposes, naked and unadorned, the caste system which segregation
manifests and fosters. A Negro can obtain service only by accepting
or appearing to accept, under the very eyes of his fellow
passengers, white and colored, the caste system which the
segregation signifies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This message of humiliation comes, not as a single voice, but
with all the reverberations of the entire pattern of segregation
and discrimination of which it is a part.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief urged the Supreme Court to find that the segregated
dining car violated the Interstate Commerce Act. But if it was
necessary to reconsider the separate-but-equal rule, the brief
said, the court should reject it as ``a constitutional
anachronism'' subjecting blacks to ``humiliation on the pretense
that they are being treated as equals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court found unanimously that segregated dining cars
violated the Interstate Commerce Act. The practice, it said, called
``attention to a racial classification of passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices did not then face the constitutionality of
segregation. But on the day they decided the Henderson case, they
began striking down state rules that made blacks go to a separate
law school or be segregated in university classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Elman was my friend. I decided to write about him because
what he did shows that the civil servants who are often dismissed
as ``bureaucrats'' can do important, even noble work. At a time
when Southern leaders insisted that segregation was equality, he
showed its crushing reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department from then on played an important part in
racial cases _ right up to Brown vs. Board of Education, decided on
May 17, 1954, 12 years to the day from Elmer Henderson's train
ride.

FEDERAL BUDGETEERS PONDER A MULTIPLE-CHOICE SURPLUS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let the budget games _ bigger and more rancorous
than ever _ begin Congress will return to town this week, and the
first order of business for the Republican majority will be to
start sparring with President Clinton and the Democrats over what
to do with the tax revenue that is flooding into the Treasury in
quantities substantially greater than either party imagined even a
few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a reader's guide to Round One: How Big Is My Surplus?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the federal budget surplus is growing, but
over the next few weeks there will be a complicated and
jargon-ridden argument over just how large it will be. The
Congressional Budget Office will go first, releasing its
projections on Wednesday. The White House's Office of Management
and Budget will follow early next month.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal situation is so complex this year that the budget
office is likely to provide not one set of numbers but three.
</P>
<P>
   The first set will be what budgeteers refer to as a ``capped
baseline.'' It will assume that government spending next year will
decline, by tens of billions of dollars, to meet a statutory limit
set in 1997 but shattered for the last two years. Under this
script, spending would then decline again in 2002, and then grow at
the rate of inflation for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the capped baseline, the government's operating surplus _
the portion of the surplus generated by general tax revenue rather
than excess Social Security payroll taxes _ could be twice as much
over the next 10 years as projected last year. That would mean a
non-Social Security surplus of nearly $2 trillion for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   That is a staggering amount of money even by Washington's
standards, enough to set off a frenzied rush to enact tax cuts and
big new spending programs, or to make an accelerated push toward
paying off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and some Republicans say it is a fantasy, because
the spending assumptions behind it are unrealistic. Especially in
an election year, they say, there will be no will to slash
spending, and given the surplus outlook, no need.
</P>
<P>
   So the budget office will probably set out some alternative
projections.
</P>
<P>
   One, favored by many influential Republicans, is known as
``without discretionary inflation,'' or WODI. It assumes no
spending cuts this year. But it also assumes a freeze in
discretionary spending _ basically everything except Social
Security, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt _ for
the rest of the decade, without even adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   WODI could yield a surplus nearly as large as the capped
baseline. Most Democrats, however, think WODI is no more realistic,
given the overwhelming pressure on both parties to spend more each
year. They are hoping the budget office will provide what they call
a ``discretionary growth baseline,'' which would assume that
spending will grow from its current level at the rate of inflation
each year for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Democrats want to bake some spending increases into
the budget pie for the next decade, rather than having to fight
each year just to keep inflation from eating away at the real value
of expenditures. Under those assumptions, the 10-year surplus
projection would be hundreds of billions of dollars less than under
the other two options.
</P>
<P>
   But the CBO projections, however numerous, will be only the
start. Clinton administration officials say their estimates will
almost certainly be lower than any of the congressional numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the White House seems likely to start with
slightly lower assumptions about economic growth and about the
current fiscal year's surplus. Those small differences, multiplied
over 10 years, could leave the White House surplus estimates for
the decade as much as $400 billion lower than the congressional
surplus estimate, even if both were to work with a capped baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House is all but certain to build its main
surplus estimate around an assumption that spending will at least
keep pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? So are some of the people who make a living working
with these numbers. But there are a few simple things to keep in
mind as fiscal policy plays out this year.
</P>
<P>
   First, by any measure, the projected non-Social Security surplus
will be huge, providing an opportunity for a real national debate,
in an election year no less, about how the fruits of the current
prosperity should be invested.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the numbers could change radically for the worse if the
economy turns down or the stock market plunges.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the two sides have largely agreed to take off the table
the entire surplus generated by Social Security _ $2 trillion over
10 years by last year's projection _ and to use that money only for
debt reduction or to overhaul the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, the likelihood of political gridlock in Washington
this year is so high that you will almost certainly have an
opportunity to try to make sense of all this again next year.
</P>

COLOMBIAN PEACE DEAL NEAR, UN ENVOY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA _ Just 10 days after the Clinton administration proposed
giving the Colombian government $1.6 billion to combat the drug
trade here, the government and the main rebel group appear poised
to strike the first part of a peace deal, a United Nations envoy
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After secret meetings this week with President Andres Pastrana
and guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda Velez, Jan Egeland, the UN
special representative to Colombia, told the Globe he was
optimistic that a deal would emerge. He gave no timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more political willingness to bring the peace process
forward than I've seen in any past point in the process _ and I've
been involved with Colombia for more than 20 years,'' Egeland said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Colombia, devastated from more than 40 years of
civil war that has killed an estimated 35,000 people, has become a
major concern for US officials because of a huge increase of drugs
flowing from the country into the United States. Officials estimate
that Colombian drug traffickers, with help from rebel groups,
supply 80 percent of America's cocaine. The rebels were among the
harshest critics of Clinton's plan to sharply upgrade US aid here.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials, including Representative William D. Delahunt, a
Massachusetts Democrat, believe the only chance to stem the flow of
drugs is through a peace settlement. But few people, inside and
outside Colombia, have previously held much hope for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering Egeland's positive assessment, Colombian President
Andres Pastrana, also in an interview with the Globe, said the
government was ``willing to start'' projects with Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia if it forcibly joined the fight against
drugs. He said such cooperation had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with them in eradication'' of coca and poppy
plants, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   Egeland, the former deputy prime minister of Norway who has
helped mediate peace deals in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and
Latin America, said he expects the government and the guerrilla
movement to agree to the first step of a plan for more roads and
schools and alternative crops for farmers in neglected rural areas.
It would be the first concrete step toward ending one of the most
intractable wars in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration aid plan, which will come up for
debate in Congress next month, is tilted heavily toward giving the
Colombian armed forces more military firepower and intelligence in
attacking the explosion of drug cultivation. Many analysts believe
the plan could easily kill the peace process because the fight
would be directed in areas held by guerrillas, who rule in
provinces filled with coca and poppy fields, the raw ingredients in
the production of cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, numbering about 15,000 and known by their Spanish
acronym FARC, are believed to reap hundreds of millions of dollars
through taxing traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' cooperation in fighting drugs also is doubted in
several quarters, including the Narcotics Affairs Section at the US
Embassy in Bogota, which runs drug eradication programs. The
US-donated OV-10 planes used to spray pesticides on coca and poppy
fields have come under frequent fire from guerrillas. American
citizens, working for private companies, fly the planes, one of
which was struck by three bullets on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana launched the peace process more than a year ago after
he agreed to a guerrilla demand to demilitarize a Switzerland-sized
area in Colombia, essentially ceding control to more than 30
percent of the country. But since then, the process has stalled,
sparking massive pro-peace civilian marches and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting a lunch this week for a delegation of four US
congressman, including Delahunt, Pastrana said that the guerrillas
have been unfairly linked with drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the starting points to say that they are not a
narco-guerrilla group. They are really a guerrilla-insurgency group
and they are willing to fight drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he would encourage other US congressmen
to visit FARC leaders; Delahunt met with a FARC leader last summer,
the only congressman in recent years to meet with the guerrillas, a
trip to the demilitarized zone that caused great discomfort to US
diplomats who worried about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana said such meetings were important so that the
guerrillas ``will themselves know what people are thinking about
them outside Colombia. ... You have to realize that these people
have been in the mountains for the last 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a diplomatic offensive at this point,''
Delahunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Egeland, the UN envoy for Secretary-General Kofi Annan, revealed
he met for three hours with FARC leader Marulanda on Tuesday,
sitting on the veranda of a small house about a two-hour drive from
San Vicente del Caguan, south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Marulanda and Egeland, ate lunch and talked around
a small table about the agenda for the peace process and how the
United Nations ``could assist in alternative development,'' such as
creating new markets for farmers who now grow coca and poppy,
Egeland said.
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda told Egeland ``that in the last one and half years the
FARC has learned that the government is sincere and wants to
negotiate an end to the war,'' the envoy said. ``He said he looks
forward to working with the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Egeland said he ``spent hours'' talking with Pastrana at the
presidential palace in Bogota on Monday and then Tuesday night,
immediately following the talk with Marulanda. While stressing that
neither he nor anyone else was acting as a mediator between the
parties, he and Pastrana talked extensively on Tuesday about a key
concern of the guerrillas and the United Nations _ the need for the
government to rein in paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has to crack down on the paramilitaries. I told
Pastrana this, and he agreed,'' Egeland said.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary groups, a 5,000-member force, are responsible
for about 70 percent of all political violence in Colombia,
according to the US State Department and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this peace process could have moved faster,'' Egeland
said. ``But Colombian history is full of failed peace process and
the murder of many who laid down their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Colombian process ``is more complex than any I have
seen,'' including the 1993 Oslo peace deal between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, and that the talks now could still fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I think Pastrana has initiated an irreversible
process toward ending the war. The biggest mistake we can do now is
to see Colombia as a lost case. It is not. The world needs peace in
Colombia as much as Colombia needs international support and
investment.''

 &HT;    Whirlpool stock dives after Home Depot drops launch of company's
appliances
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whirlpool's stock plunged as much as 12 percent
Friday, following a report that Home Depot has dropped the nation's
largest appliance maker from a product launch.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot disclosed to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on Thursday that it had stopped ordering from
Whirlpool in the early stages of a major appliance roll-out to more
than 900 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company has said exactly why Whirlpool was dropped from
the launch. Analysts cited shipping delays caused by possible
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is continuing the appliance program with its other
major partner, General Electric. That roll-out should be complete
by August. The home improvement retailer is shopping around for
another supplier of washers, dryers and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot and Whirlpool said they are continuing to discuss a
partnership for ``a long-term relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions that both parties finally must make will be
based on how well this opportunity fits both company's long-term
strategies,'' said Whirlpool Chairman and Chief Executive David R.
Whitwam in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool stock closed at $57.50, down $2, but not before
falling as much as $7.25. Volume was nearly 2.5 million shares,
compared with average volume of around 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing reports of shipping problems, Whitwam cited the
company's fourth-quarter earnings report, which will be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unit sales volumes outpaced industry growth in North
America for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. The view
that continuing systems problems are affecting our ability to ship
and supply our customers runs counter to the evidence of our fourth
quarter 1999 performance,'' Whitwam said.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool is expected to earn $1.48 per share in the fourth
quarter, according to a First Call/Thomson Financial survey of
analysts. That compares with $1.09 a share in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock closed Friday at $59.75, down $1.06 1/4.

CAR BOMBS KILL 1, INJURE SEVERAL IN MADRID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Two car bombs exploded in Madrid Friday, killing
a Spanish army officer and injuring several other people. The
government accused the Basque separatist group ETA of staging the
attacks, which would be the first after a year and a half of peace
overtures that included a unilateral cease-fire which the rebels
broke off late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two blasts came four days after Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar set general elections for March 12. No one has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, but the long-feared renewal of
separatist violence immediately took center stage in the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The first car bomb, activated by remote control at about 8:10
a.m., killed Lt. Col. Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 47, as he walked
in his neighborhood, where many military families live, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspected rebels then fled several blocks in a second car,
which they left to explode about 30 minutes later. The police said
a 14-year-old girl was also injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETA will fail,'' Aznar said in a nationally televised address.
``The attack in Madrid is a sign of their weakness, not their
strength. The government will not step back one inch in the fight
against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, has fought for 31 years for an independent
Basque homeland. But its last fatal attack was on June 25, 1998,
when a bomb killed a Basque town councilman from Aznar's ruling
center-right Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   The past year and a half has been the longest period in three
decades without separatist violence, and had raised hopes that both
sides might use the rebels' unilateral cease-fire, declared in
September 1998, to achieve a lasting peace to a conflict that
officials say has killed about 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 people demonstrated Friday evening in Madrid
to demand an end to Basque violence, but at similar gatherings in
two Basque provincial capitals, San Sebastian and Bilbao, the
state-run news agency EFE reported that were was tension when
political supporters of the rebels showed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   The protests against terrorism, scheduled to continue throughout
the weekend, apparently sought to revive the outpouring in 1997
when millions of Spaniards marched in the streets for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The first political fallout from the blasts came while workers
were sweeping up broken glass at the bomb sites in southwestern
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the regional Basque government, Juan Jose
Ibarretxe, said that his moderate Basque Nationalist Party would
suspend its parliamentary deal for support from the Euskal
Herritarrok coalition, widely considered to be the rebels'
political wing.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarretxe said the suspension would last until the coalition,
whose name means Basque Citizens, clearly condemns the rebel
violence. But a coalition leader, Arnaldo Otegi, retorted that
while the attack was the work only of its perpetrators, the entire
political class shared blame for not preventing it.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, when announcing on Jan. 17 the March election date, said
that he had started his first term in 1996 with the goal of
standing firm against Basque terrorism. He and Joaquin Almunia,
leader of the opposition Socialist Party, had agreed that the fight
against the rebels was a national matter that should not divide the
major political parties during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Almunia, alluding to differences, said Friday:
``Unfortunately, in recent weeks, unity among the democratic
parties has not been sufficiently strong and intense. We have not
been able to meet the high standards demanded by the citizens who
remind us that the only one to blame for the terrorism is ETA.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 14-month cease-fire, which the rebels initially
described as ``indefinite,'' the government negotiated only once
directly with rebel leaders, at a secret meeting last May 19 in
Switzerland. But the peace effort had been stalled for months
before the rebels announced last Nov. 28 that attacks could resume
by Dec. 3.

<P>
   Vernon Forrest will step into a ring in Las Vegas on Saturday
night for the 31st time as a professional boxer. It will not be a
title fight. Although he is undefeated in eight years as a pro and
is considered one of the best welterweights in the world, Forrest
has never been given a chance to fight a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Johnson, a Brooklyn-born boxer, never got a title fight,
either. Johnson died of injuries he suffered during a bout in
Atlantic City, N.J., two months ago. Canadian authorities had
suspended him for medical reasons last April, but officials in New
Jersey, South Carolina and Georgia continued to let him fight,
despite a CAT scan suggesting that he might have a brain injury and
required more medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the tales of these two fighters underscore what many
critics say is the pivotal problem in boxing today: there is no
central governing body, as there is in other professional sports,
that would enforce safety rules, create credible rankings and
insure that the best fighters rise. In short, no one is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   And while government generally has not regulated boxing
aggressively, a federal judge in Newark, N.J., did step in last
week, appointing a monitor to run the International Boxing
Federation, the only U.S.-based group that ranks professional
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time that a federal court had intervened to
oversee a private sports organization, and it followed the
indictment of four IBF officials on charges of soliciting bribes
from managers and promoters to inflate boxers' rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport is a bit like Dodge City,'' said Lou DiBella, a
senior vice president at Home Box Office, a major broadcaster of
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations vary from state to state, as does enforcement.
Contracts among fighters, managers, promoters and television
outlets are unregulated and often written to exploit young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctioning organizations do not rank each other's champions,
leading to a proliferation of titles, but few fights between the
best fighters. There are now 47 champions in 17 weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most damaging to the sport's standing is that the
ranking of contenders has often lacked credibility and that the
federal and state governments have failed _ at least until last
week _ to take charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governance of the sport is corrupt, period,'' DiBella
said, ``and everyone involved in the sport knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been able to do much about it. Boxing has long
defied efforts to clean it up. That is partly because no one is
truly in charge and partly because change would not be in the
interest of the small circle of promoters, rating organizations and
celebrity boxers who benefit from the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing promoters, unlike employers in other sports, see
themselves as individual entrepreneurs in competition with one
another, rather than as a group with a mutual interest in
protecting the sport's image and promoting fair and credible
competition, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corruption in the industry has never been so
complicated,'' said Elliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general, who headed a task force on boxing. ``It's just been
impossible to root out.''

   Vernon Forrest fell in love with pugilism early, at the age of
6, when he wandered from a playground into a nearby gym in Augusta,
Ga. A well-respected light-heavyweight, Binny Heard, was knocking
sparring partners to the canvas. Forrest was entranced.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an auto mechanic and a cleaning woman, Forrest fought
225 amateur fights and lost only 16. In 1991, he won a silver medal
at the world amateur championships, losing on points to Konstantin
Tszyu, one of the world's best welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he won the U.S. amateur title and was
favored to do well in the Olympics. But he contracted a stomach
virus the night before his first bout and lost. His teammate, Oscar
De La Hoya, won a gold medal that year and has since become a
welterweight superstar.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional, Forrest, who is 28, has won all 30 of his
bouts, 25 by knockout. Steve Farhood, the former editor of Ring
magazine, said Forrest was talented enough to deserve a title
fight, even though he has not fought many highly ranked fighters.
Most champions and contenders do not want to fight a dangerous
fighter with little name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a guy the very best don't want to fight,''
Farhood said. ``It's all about risk versus reward. With Vernon the
risk is very high, and the reward is not where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Forrest had risen to No. 4 in the World Boxing
Council ranking, where De La Hoya had become champion. But Forrest
could not get a title shot from the champion's promoter, Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said that, because Forrest was not well known, he would not
draw enough viewers to pay-per-view television to make a fight
profitable. ``It has nothing to do with ability, but nobody knows
who Vernon Forrest is,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest's handlers decided he might have a better shot competing
in the International Boxing Federation, where Felix Trinidad has
been the champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Forrest was also unable to rise to the coveted No. 1
contender's status in the IBF ranking. What irks Forrest and his
handlers was that a series of fighters with questionable skills
remained above him in the ranking, and two of them, Vincent Pettway
and Raul Frank, were promoted by Don King, who is also Trinidad's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway tied up the top contender's spot for more than two
years, though most boxing aficionados considered his ranking
absurd. He had not fought anyone with a winning record since 1995
and had not fought a welterweight with a winning record since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway was abruptly dropped from the ranking on the eve of a
mandatory fight with the champion, Trinidad, last April after HBO
executives, fearing a bloodbath, objected to televising the fight.
A doctor discovered just before the bout that Pettway had a
detached retina.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettway disappeared from view, Hugo Pineda, of Colombia,
became the top contender. Pineda, who had fought primarily against
little-known boxers in Colombia, was ranked right above Forrest at
No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That ranking apparently was tainted, however. In November 1997,
Pineda jumped from No. 6 to No. , after a $5,000 bribe was paid to
IBF officials, according to the federal indictment. Although the
indictment did not name Pineda, it gave details identifying the
date and terms of his ascension in the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda fought Trinidad in Puerto Rico last May, with Trinidad
knocking him out in the fourth round. With Pettway and Pineda gone,
Forrest rose to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the final insult for Forrest came last October, when he was
dropped back down to No. 4 by the IBF. Shane Mosley, a powerful
lightweight who had moved up to the welterweight division, was
placed above him, even though Forrest had beaten Mosley in their
only meeting, as amateurs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The other fighter who moved past Forrest in October, Michael
Covington, a little-known journeyman, was promptly knocked out in
November by a fighter ranked below Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   Because Forrest has never reached the coveted top contender's
slot, he had no leverage in negotiations with King, the champion's
promoter. Forrest's manager, Shelly Finkel, said he had approached
King several times about arranging a fight against Trinidad, but
King demanded that Forrest give King rights to future fights in
return for a title bout. ``He wanted too much,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fritz, a spokesman for King, denied that King has any
influence over the IBF's rankings, although he acknowledged that
King was in a position to demand concessions from Forrest. ``If
Vernon Forrest really wants to fight Felix Trinidad, then he needs
to make an agreement that is good for the champion,'' Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, who has never made more than $100,000 for a bout, said
he was now desperate enough to make a deal with King. ``In boxing
you have four or five guys making the majority of the money,''
Forrest said, ``and everyone else is in the lower class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I always thought I would retire around
30,'' he said. ``I thought by then I would have accomplished all my
goals in the professional game. But I haven't even scratched the
surface of what I wanted to accomplish.''

 UNDATED: to accomplish.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dubious rankings and outright corruption are hardly new in
boxing. For much of the 20th century, organized crime controlled
the sport in America. But what distinguishes boxing from other
professional sports is that repeated efforts to clean it up have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Those failures are linked to boxing's structure: there is no
organized association of fighters or managers or promoters that
could oversee fundamental change. And government has generally been
unable or unwilling to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who run the organizations that rank fighters
became powerful in the late 1970s and 1980s as self-proclaimed
reformers, intending to reward contenders solely on the merits. But
they, too, have come under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a federal judge last week used for the first time
a civil racketeering statute usually employed against organized
crime and corrupt labor unions to appoint a monitor to run the IBF.
The appointment was sought by federal prosecutors after the
indictment of four IBF officials on bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effects of this prosecution are hard to predict,
of course. But critics, including many boxing people, say the
industry's chaotic structure has made it nearly impossible to
repair. Without a central governing body, there are no universally
recognized rankings, no coherent system of rules, no ethical
guidelines for contracts, no fair business standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the more powerful promoters like the status quo,''
said Arum, who is among the top American boxing promoters, along
with King, Cedric Kushner, Kathy Duva and Dan Goosen.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Sugar, a historian of the sport, described boxing as ``the
last single entrepreneurial sport there is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are out there cannibalizing everyone else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The few professional boxers who achieve celebrity status and
contracts for multimillion-dollar title fights also benefit from
the present system. But the mythology of the fighter who rises from
poverty to wealth belies reality: managers say that fewer boxers
than ever before are even able to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has shied away from a direct role in
overseeing boxing, although Congress passed legislation in 1994
requiring states to share information and honor medical suspensions
of boxers issued by individual states.
</P>
<P>
   States have not been particularly aggressive about regulating
boxing, in part because some _ like New York, New Jersey and Nevada
_ are in competition for bouts.
</P>
<P>
   New York did begin last year to require promoters and ranking
groups to disclose their contracts and fees. But if one state were
to come down hard on boxing unilaterally, promoters would simply
move bouts to other places.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, New York's attorney general, said that unless states
agreed to raise the bar together, efforts to improve boxing would
fail. ``One state against the other will destroy the sport,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the existing regulations do not always protect fighters.
The death of Stephan Johnson is a sad case study.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a junior middleweight, and his manager were able to
gain approval last year for fights in three states while he was
under medical suspension in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario authorities had suspended Johnson after he suffered
an odd knockout during a fight against Fitz Vanderpool in Toronto
last April. Though he had led in scoring through most of the bout,
Johnson appeared simply to stagger back and collapsed in the 10th
round, without being hit. ``He was just like he ran out of gas,''
the Ontario athletics commissioner, Ken Hayaschi, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayaschi required Johnson to undergo a CAT scan, a brain wave
test and four hours of tests involving memory and motor skills
before fighting again. Ontario posted the suspension on the
Internet through Fight Fax, a private records company that is an
official clearinghouse for medical information.
</P>
<P>
   A CAT scan was performed on Johnson in New York City two days
after the fight. Johnson sent a written report on the CAT scan to
Ontario's boxing regulators, but he never submitted the other two
tests. Hayaschi said he simply filed the CAT scan away and waited
for the other tests to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Johnson fell unconscious during a fight in
Atlantic City last November and subsequently died that Hayaschi
pulled the file and showed Johnson's CAT scan to Canadian
neurologists. The doctors said there were slight abnormalities in
Johnson's brain that warranted further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was border-line normal,'' Hayaschi said. ``I would never
have let him fight again based on that CAT scan alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York radiologist who administered the scan, Dr. Mika
Lidov, wrote in her report that a magnetic resonance imaging test
was needed to determine whether a dense area on one side of the
brain was evidence of internal bleeding, which would indicate a
brain injury, said three people who have read the report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Johnson's suspension in Canada, the boxing commission in
South Carolina approved a fight in August between Johnson and
Otilio Villarreal. The state commission ruled that it did not have
to honor the Ontario suspension because it came from a foreign
country, said James Knight, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires a state seeking to lift a boxer's
suspension to consult in writing with the state that imposed the
suspension. The law does not spell out whether a state must consult
with a Canadian province or other foreign jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   A family doctor in South Carolina, Dr. R.L. Ashton, gave each
fighter a physical before the bout and pronounced each of them fit.
The matchmaker, Walter Johnson, said he gave Stephan Johnson's CAT
scan results to the boxing commission at the weigh-in, but it is
unclear whether Ashton reviewed it. Ashton did not return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fought 10 rounds against Villarreal without difficulty
and won the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's manager, Kenneth Woods, arranged another bout in
Albany, Ga., for early October. Georgia does not require a CAT scan
for fighters who have been knocked out. But Thomas Mishou, the
executive director of the Georgia Boxing Commission, told the
matchmaker, Bobby Mitchell, on Sept. 22 that Johnson would have to
convince Canadian authorities that he was healthy before he could
fight in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the matchmaker informed Mishou that the suspension
had been lifted. Mishou then checked with Fight Fax, he said, and
Johnson's name had indeed been removed from the list.
</P>
<P>
   How that happened is a mystery. Phill Marder, the president of
Fight Fax, said that on Sept. 23, South Carolina officials had
contacted his company to say Johnson should be taken off the
suspension list. South Carolina authorities deny they made the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fought Calvin Moody, an overmatched journeyman, on Oct.
2 in Georgia, knocking him out.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Johnson again gained approval to fight, this
time from the New Jersey State Athletic Commission for a November
bout in Atlantic City against Paul Vaden _ a match that could have
led to a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson's death, the state attorney general and the
director of gaming enforcement began an investigation into how he
got approved to fight in New Jersey. While no one at the New Jersey
commission would comment on the case last week, a commission
spokeswoman said in December that Sylvester Cuy-ler, a chief boxing
inspector who is not a doctor, had approved Johnson's application
after he reviewed Johnson's CAT scan, along with some other tests.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Rhonda Utley Herring, said Cuyler looked at the
radiologist's report, interpreted it to mean the fighter's brain
was normal and sent the application to his superiors for approval.
It is not clear whether any doctor in New Jersey reviewed the CAT
scan results before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th round of the Atlantic City bout, Johnson staggered
backward after absorbing a series of light blows and fainted,
hitting his head on the rope and mat. He died 15 days later of
bleeding and swelling on the left side of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   His family is planning a lawsuit against all three state boxing
commissions. ``It was certainly a questionable CAT scan and should
have provoked additional inquiry at the very least,'' said a lawyer
for Johnson's family, Richard Giampa. ``Based on the evidence of
the CAT scan alone, he should not have been permitted to fight.''

DOMAIN NAMES COULD BE WORTH 7 FIGURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- What's in a name? More than a million
bucks, if you've got the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Internet address auctioneer GreatDomains.com has four it
believes are worth seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   They include Year2000.com, which was put up for sale on the
auction site eBay for $10 million but the winning bid turned out to
be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining three -- Loans.com, Cinema.com and Taxes.com --
are being sold in a joint auction that will close Jan. 28, said
Jeff Tinsley, chief executive officer of GreatDomains.com.
</P>
<P>
   The auction is being billed as the highest aggregate value sale
to date of domain names, the electronic addresses to Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be big. We have a verified offer for loans of
$1.3 million and offers of over $1 million for taxes and cinema,''
Tinsley said. ``We've actually received offers in excess of $3
million for loans.com that are in the process of verification.''
</P>
<P>
   The verified bids for taxes and cinema stand at $250,000 each as
of Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley values the loans.com domain name at or near the price
for which his company sold business.com: $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the larger bidders are holding back until
the end of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always happens that way,'' Tinsley said. ``We're not
surprised at all at the offers we've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying six- and seven-figure prices for the right to use a name
is increasingly common, said Clay Ryder, vice president and chief
analyst for Zona Research, a Redwood City, Calif.-based Internet
Research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price paid is either absurd or it's not -- depending on
your point of view,'' Ryder said. ``What they spend advertising
them far outstrips the amount of money they pay for the name.''
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains.com has a strict verification process to protect
sellers as well as buyers who are putting up those huge sums of
money, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's account executives receive the bids, then calls
the company or person who submitted them.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains.com also requires some sort of financial
verification as well, Tinsley said. It can be in the form of a bank
statement showing that the bidder in fact has the money or it can
be a letter of credit from the bidder's bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to show us the money. We're not going to take any
offers that aren't verified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That policy is designed to prevent exactly what happened to
Canadian computer consultant Peter DeJager and his partner Tenagra
Corp. of Houston. The partners auctioned their domain name,
year2000.com, on eBay, but the winning bid and the second-highest
bid both were fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A bid verification policy such as the one GreatDomains.com has
would prevent that problem, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay takes a much less active role in managing the transactions
on its site than does GreatDomains.com, said Kevin Pursglove, eBay
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the Internet to allow individuals to conduct their own
business,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   He said eBay offers bid verification service through outside
contractors at an extra charge, in much the same way eBay offers
escrow service.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder said sellers who are unfamiliar with the ways of the
Internet set themselves up for just such a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are uneducated in the market in which they're
playing are going to lay peril to those who victimize,'' Ryder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said the vast majority of eBay customers -- buyers and
sellers -- conduct their transactions with no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 90 percent of the transactions that take place on
eBay satisfy the buyer and the seller,'' Pursglove said. ``Here's
an example where we had a problem and we had a customer who is not
satisfied. We hope to learn from it and if necessary we will have
new policies in place to deal with it.''

SUBSIDIES AND MERGERS ROIL OUTLOOK FOR DRUGS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Questions may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This could be a big, potentially painful week for big drug
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is State of the Union day, and there is more than a
passing interest _ and fear _ at the companies and on Wall Street
about what President Clinton will say about prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about subsidies has been a drag on drug stocks for months,
stunting the group's performance despite two megamergers, one done,
the other a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malley, portfolio manager of the $1.2 billion Janus Global
Life Sciences fund, took some time last week to talk about mergers,
politics and prospects in the health care business. Following are
some excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's start with the deal that isn't a deal yet, the one
involving Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and Pfizer. Last
week it was reported that Procter &AMP; Gamble was approached by
Warner-Lambert as a white knight to fend off the Pfizer bid. Do you
put much credence in that? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It could happen if Procter &AMP; Gamble bought both American Home
Products and Warner-Lambert, because you could take out more costs.
But the dilution would be too great if they just bought
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   As Warner-Lambert shareholders, we wouldn't want to see Procter
&AMP; Gamble buy Warner-Lambert. There is not a lot of overlap between
the two companies, so I can't imagine they could cut costs very
much. And at its core, Procter &AMP; Gamble is a single-digit growth
rate company. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So is this overture merely an attempt to get Pfizer to up
their bid? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That is what I am hoping. We also own Pfizer. I think a
Pfizer transaction is a great deal for Warner-Lambert. But there
may be some resistance at Warner-Lambert, because some of their
folks may lose their jobs. Pfizer may raise its offer 5 percent to
10 percent to get the company, but I don't think they will go
beyond that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The deal that did get done, Glaxo Wellcome's $76 billion
takeover of SmithKline Beecham, hasn't thrilled investors. Why? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we don't own either stock.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of a bounce doesn't really surprise me, because the
residual growth rate when you combine these companies isn't any
higher. You get a couple of years of cost cutting, and then you are
done. When a merger gets done you like to see something that adds
to the residual growth rate of the surviving entity. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This week the president is widely expected to propose some
sort of subsidy to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs.
What do you expect he will say? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The administration has been throwing out a lot of trial
balloons and the market is very nervous about what Clinton will
propose.
</P>
<P>
   He probably will offer some plan to pay for drugs. The issue is
whether it is through a private cooperative with a voucher for all
sorts of medical services, including drugs, or through a federal
agency like the Veterans Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The latter would scare people a lot. The Veterans Administration
gets the biggest discount allowable, at times as much as 40 percent
to 50 percent, depending on the drug. Applied broadly, that would
mean the biggest chunk of the industry might take a price hit of a
like amount. That would annihilate research. That is the fear.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think Clinton will not be so bold. But no matter
what he proposes, it is difficult to see anything passing this year
because this is a tough issue. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of folks argue that drug stocks won't go much of
anywhere until the issue is addressed by a new Congress and a new
president in 2001. Do you agree? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On the surface, I wouldn't disagree with that. Drugs are
likely to underperform technology and biotechnology, even though
the latter group is looking very, very frothy.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point these stocks will get so cheap that people
will come in to look. This is not the steel industry. It's not
going away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your fund was up 60 percent last year. Drug stocks didn't
generate that sort of growth. So what areas of health care have you
been buying that did? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have owned our quality drug companies without adding to
our positions in them. The entire drug position is only one to two
percent of all the assets at Janus. It is a little bit more than
that in my fund, but only marginally. We have been buying stuff in
medical devices, in biotechnology, in health care technology. It's
very spread out.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you name some stocks you like? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We really like QLT Photo Therapeutics, which will be
launching a drug this spring that retards a growth in the blood
vessels in the eye that is the leading cause of blindness in the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   We are positive on Incyte, which has genomic data bases. And we

`BIG MONEY' CORRUPTING BAY STATE BALLOT ISSUES, CRITICS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Big money donors and corporations are pouring money
into Massachusetts to create sweeping new laws through the ballot
process, a development that is alarming reformers who say the
initiative petition system is being corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to just buy a car or electronic equipment, but now
you can buy a law,'' said George Pillsbury, executive director of
the Massachusetts Money and Politics Project, a group which
monitors campaign financing and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, a New York financier, and two wealthy donors from
Ohio and Arizona contributed nearly $400,000 to hire signature
gatherers to win a spot on the ballot for a drug measure. Their
initiative would allow low-level drug dealers to receive treatment
instead of jail time, and make it tougher for law enforcement
officials to seize assets from those accused of drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has so far poured $1 million into a campaign to fight a
ballot measure that would require it and other cable firms to open
their lines to competitors. Grace Internet Capital, the owner of
several Internet companies, spent $600,000 to get the law on the
ballot next November.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, which is trying to promote charitable
giving, spent $175,000 to win a spot for a state income tax
deduction for charitable donations. Putnam Investments kicked in
another $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Government watchdogs say they are alarmed at the role
corporations and out-of-state financial interests are playing in
the upcoming election, bypassing the Legislature and its public
hearing process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this election cycle appears to mark the completion of a
shift which began in 1994 and transformed the initiative petition
process from voluntary citizens efforts to well-financed operations
of paid signature gatherers.
</P>
<P>
   Even anti-tax leader Barbara Anderson and her followers, once
the model for citizen participation in the initiative process, had
to rely on Governor Paul Cellucci and other Republicans to raise
funds to pay a Nevada firm $100,000 to collect signatures for the
measure to cut the income tax. A citizens' effort in 1998 failed to
gather enough signatures to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The only true grass-roots drive to win a ballot spot this cycle
appears to be the campaign to ban dog racing in Massachusetts.
Those advocates gathered 83,526 signatures -- well above the
necessary 57,000 required to qualify for the ballot -- but only
spent $330 to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury said the initiative petition process was created early
in the last century to allow citizens, who were frustrated by
legislative inaction, to take their cases directly to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the framers of the constitutional amendment made the
process ``intentionally burdensome'' so that it would not be used
frivolously. He said they also envisioned it to be a voluntary
citizens enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what we're seeing with these professional signature
gathering firms, is the burdened removed,'' Pillsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot proposals for this year offer dramatic changes.
Soros' measure in particular is raising strong concern from law
enforcements officials.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sullivan, the district attorney in Plymouth County, said
the proposal would create legal loopholes for drug dealers and
traffickers to escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a huge setback,'' Sullivan said, saying the
state's tough drug laws have contributed heavily to the crime rate
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The law would allow a defendants to declare themselves at risk
of becoming drug addicted and ask a judge to send them to a drug
treatment program rather than jail. It would also make it more
difficult for law enforcement to force the forfeiture of money and
property in low-level drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and other law enforcment officials say they are
convinced that Soros' campaign is aimed at eventually legalizing
marijuana and lowering the penalities for trafficking. ``This
becomes the first step toward decriminalizing drug dealing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros and the other two financiers -- Phoenix businessman John
Sperling and Peter Lewis, a Cleveland insurance executive -- have
not advocated legalizing drugs. But they have bankrolled efforts
around the country to ease drug laws. For example they have
financed campaigns to allow for the medicinal use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stewart, a spokesman for Soros' Massachusetts-sponsored
campaign, dispute Sullivan assertion that the ballot question would
lead to decriminalization of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't gut the anti-drug laws,'' Stewart said. ``It raises
the bar for civil fortfeitures. There will still be seizures and
forfeitures on the criminal side.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the proposed changes in the drug laws would only
apply to small-time dealers and trafickers. He said sentencing
discretion is left to judges, and the law would screen virtually
all violent and serious criminals out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury believes the petiton process has become so corrupted
by big money interests that the state needs a law banning the use
paid signature gathers. But that may be legally dubious. A similar
ban in Colorado was thrown out by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back to the framers' original intentions, that
it be only a bona fide citizens movement,'' Pillsbury said.

<P>
   PERRY, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore stumped across farm country
in central Iowa Friday, recalling his days in the 4-H Club, his
Angus cattle and how his father taught him to stop gullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my dad the respect for the environment that all
farmers who farm their own land have,'' Gore told a barnful of
farmers and their families here, noting that he grew up in a
Washington hotel but spent his summers on the family farm in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a young boy, he used to teach me how to stop a
gully before it really got started,'' Gore said. ``At first I
couldn't see the lay of the land the way he could and recognize
when a gully was starting up there, but I learned from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination,
noted that farming accounted for only 20 percent of Iowa's economy.
But, he said, ``the space between the concentrated population in
the cities depends upon the health of the farm economy.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his pitch for votes in Monday's Iowa caucuses, he
said he wanted to bring income to rural areas from sources other
than farming, like the Internet. He said that Iowa's Democratic
governor, Tom Vilsack, who has remained neutral in the contest, had
helped the state develop ``the most sophisticated information
superhighway of any state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bus tour across Iowa was punctuated with brief references
to his opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who said
on Thursday that he had experienced four bouts of irregular
heartbeat in the last month. Gore told reporters: ``He's in great
health, and it shouldn't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the expectations for his performance in Monday's caucuses, in
which polls show him ahead, Gore said: ``After Senator Bradley has
spent so much more money _ more money than any other Democratic
candidate in history here _ and has invested as much time and
people and TV ads and whatnot as he has, I think that if I can get
one more vote than he does, that is a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has appeared extremely confident and relaxed in the last
few days. He gave interviews on three drive-time radio programs
Friday morning, joshing with the local hosts and lapsing into a
heavy Southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   As a hedge against complacency, Gore insisted that he was still
fighting for every vote. ``I feel like a guy working with every
ounce of breath I have to get one more vote than the other guy,''
he said.

 &HT;    Sit-in dispute reveals Bush's darker side
 &HT;    (EDs: Analysis)
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jeb Bush is such an overwhelming figure
in the inner sanctum of the governor's office that his staff fears
disappointing him, disagreeing with him or getting in the path of
his sometimes withering temper.
</P>
<P>
   Those traits, say those most familiar with them, are what
blinded Bush and his closest advisers as they turned what should
have been at worst a mini-dispute with two black state lawmakers
into an escalating test of wills and a national media event.
</P>
<P>
   And while some of those around Bush expressed surprise that he
revealed his darker side in front of the press, those who work with
him have seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets like that the last thing you want to tell him is
that you can't do something,'' said a senior adviser. ``So you have
to wait until he reaches a point where he's willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely protected by his inner circle, especially Chief of
Staff Sally Bradshaw and her deputy, Cory Tilley, Bush and his top
aides tend to be dismissive of anyone who disagrees with them.
</P>
<P>
   That came through loudly to state Sen. Kendrick Meek of Miami
and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville when the two Democrats
repeatedly asked to discuss with Bush his plan for abolishing
affirmative action and were rebuffed. On the spur of the moment,
the two said they would not leave Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan's office
until Bush changed his mind about affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Bush was caught on tape threatening a staffer, saying his
life would be a ``living hell'' if the nine reporters inside with
Meek and Hill were not thrown out. Bradshaw and Tilley got into
confrontations with the press revealing their own anger and
frustration with the situation created by Meek and Hill.
</P>
<P>
   `IT CAN BE VERY TENSE'
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Bradshaw and Tilley insist on total control of events.
Anything that disrupts their carefully calculated plans can set
them off. ``Bush is the kind of guy who gets upset if you're 10
minutes late for a meeting,'' said one senior adviser. ``It can be
very tense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always his way or the highway,'' said state Rep. Lois
Frankel (D-West Palm Beach). ``He can be very charming and sincere
but I don't think he really wants to hear anyone else's ideas. He
has this sense that he can do and get away with anything and that's
what came through this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis lasted 25 hours but the fallout is going to last much
longer, say some observers. It could mobilize black voters who will
be told this is further proof that Bush and the GOP have little
regard for the needs of blacks. And what Bush clearly does not
understand is the political sensitivity in the black community to
any perception of disrespect to black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do not understand the respect issue,'' said
Tony Welch, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, who is
black. ``It's something that can be taken very personally by the
entire black community.''
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS SEE NEW VOTES
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP hoping to hold onto the U.S. senate seat being
vacated by Connie Mack, the last thing Republicans want is to see
large numbers of black Democrats going to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to play out in six months, but I
don't think you're going to see Republicans getting as many black
votes as they did in 1998,'' said Frankel, who is leading the
effort to help Democrats win back control of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   There could also be a family problem for Bush. Since taking
office, Bush has been trying to make sure that his brother, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, will have nothing to worry about in Florida in
his bid for the presidency. While there are few black Republicans
who could hurt Bush in the Florida presidential primary, a big
turnout of black Democrats in November could make it tougher for
Bush to carry the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were George W., I would have called my brother and said,
`What the hell are you doing?''' said House Democratic Leader Les
Miller of Tampa. While George W. didn't call, a member of his staff
called Tallahassee to find out what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked in previous administrations expressed
surprise at Bush's overreaction, including using 20 Florida
Departement of Law Enforcement agents to force reporters out of the
office. One former worker, now a lobbyist who worked for two
governors and fears retribution if named, said Bush needs to study
how previous governors resolved crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to Tallahassee believing nobody up here knows how to
do anything and he's going to show how it's done,'' said the former
aide. ``He's had it real easy up until now and that's going to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   With a strong economy, full employment, low crime and a
compliant GOP-led Legislature, Bush has had a smooth first year.
Most governors haven't been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM NEVER THREATENED
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after taking office in 1979, Bob Graham was
confronted by anti-death penalty demonstrators shouting obscenities
outside the mansion. It went on for weeks, including one
demonstration in the governor's office where they pounded on the
walls. Graham met them and never threatened the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also confronted a statewide truck strike, the Mariel boat
lift that brought more than 120,000 Cuban refugees to Key West, and
riots in Miami that left 19 dead _ all during his first 18 months
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people got to see the real Jeb Bush,'' said Frankel.
``If you agree with him, everything is fine but if you disagree
with him you're locked out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is intoxicated with power,'' said Welch. ``So in the face
of dissension, he does poorly.''

BELICHICK BREACHED CONTRACT, NFL CHIEF RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue gave what one league official
termed a ``purposely ambiguous'' ruling on Bill Belichick's
contract Friday so he could ``force the sides to agree on
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Tagliabue did not shock the world, ruling
that Belichick ``improperly breached'' his contract with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ruling came after Tagliabue spent Thursday
going over the briefs with his legal team and after he spoke to
Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson IV about what it would take to get a
resolution. Tagliabue had heard from Kraft that he wouldn't give up
a first-round draft pick, and that's where the gridlock occurred.
There were signs that the sides were trying to hammer out a deal
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have called a Monday press conference to announce their
new coach, expected to be linebackers coach Al Groh, unless Johnson
goes against Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that since Johnson said at his midweek press
conference that the Belichick issue and his new coach were ``all
tied in together'' that perhaps the teams would work on an
agreement over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue appears to be telling both Johnson and Kraft that he
doesn't want the NFL dragged through another antitrust suit, which
Belichick's agent and lawyer, Neil Cornrich and Jeffrey Kessler,
respectively, have threatened. Tagliabue may be angry that the
teams are battling again, and he might be telling both owners that
another antitrust suit would not be good for the league. The
commissioner apparently feels their ability to reconcile this issue
could determine whether the league faces another embarrassing court
battle, which it has traditionally lost.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, get it done or this one's on you.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots aren't willing to give up their first-round pick
(16th overall), they are making two comments: (1), that they are
unwilling to part with what they perceive to be a top player for a
coach and general manager, and (2), that Belichick isn't worth the
pick. The latter is a telling statement to make for someone you've
wanted to run your operation from the moment Pete Carroll was
fired, and probably before that.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were more than willing to cough up four picks,
including a first-, second-, third-, and fourth-rounder for Bill
Parcells in 1996, and also didn't mind giving up a first-round and
third-round pick for Curtis Martin a year later. Both moves
improved their team.
</P>
<P>
   One league official theorized that the ruling was
``Patriots-friendly'' because Tagliabue did not agree with the
Jets' contention that Belichick should be barred from seeking
employment with an NFL team for the full three years remaining on
his contract, and indicates the Jets' hold on him is only ironclad
through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Jets would need to get compensation for
Belichick this season or risk getting nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear the Patriots would be the Jets' best option as
jobs are quickly closing, with Dom Capers all but signed and
delivered in New Orleans. The only other place Belichick could go
is Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's ruling said, ``Taken as a whole, the contract and
the related memoranda constitute an agreement that Mr. Belichick
would be the Jets' head coach except when Mr. Parcells served in
that capacity. The agreement contemplated that Mr. Belichick would
automatically succeed to the head coaching position if Mr. Parcells
was no longer head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner ruled that Belichick ``agreed that, as of
mid-January 1999, both parties anticipated that he would become the
head coach at the end of the 1999 season, an outcome that was
contractually agreed to. Mr. Belichick discussed the prospect of
his becoming head coach with Mr. Parcells more than 10 times during
the 1999 season.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't pay the price, they may pay it in other
ways, especially from unhappy players who want Belichick to be the
coach. Thursday, Shawn Jefferson, who said he was speaking for many
of his teammates, guaranteed a division championship if Belichick
was the coach because of the respect he brings. Friday, Leigh
Steinberg, the agent for quarterback Drew Bledsoe, said his client
strongly endorses Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew thinks very highly of Bill Belichick,'' said Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, an experienced antitrust attorney for players and the
NBA, feels the Jets breached Belichick's contract by not elevating
Belichick into the position of director of football operations
after Parcells resigned, and therefore he should be free to seek
employment ``without limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the commissioner's decision is unlawful,'' said
Cornrich. ``We are actively assessing all of our legal options.''
</P>
<P>
   If the matter goes to court, would the Patriots wait for
Belichick or move in a different direction and hire another coach?
If they steadfastly refuse to give up a No. 1, they won't be going
after former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer, who requires
compensation in the form of a 1, 2, and 3.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Patriots waiting to ask permission to speak to
Capers, the defensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars, or
Chicago offensive coordinator Gary Crowton, a former head coach at
Louisiana Tech University, or former Oakland defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Former Raiders coach Art Shell is also available after being
fired as Atlanta's offensive line coach. Former Buffalo Bills coach
Marv Levy interviewed with Kraft two weeks ago. The Patriots would
also have the option of hiring in-house candidate Ray Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Commissioner also directed both sides to address the
following issues by Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   --Whether the Jets' contract rights to Belichick should extend
through 2002 or should be limited to the 2,000 season.
</P>
<P>
   --Whether the Jets' contract rights to Belichick should remain
in place Parcells returns as coach.
</P>
<P>
   --What procedures should be followed to determine whether the
Jets are entitled to damages for Belichick's breach of contract,
and, if so, in what amount.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who met with Johnson after the ruling Friday, said in
a very brief statement, ``The commissioner's ruling and order are
clear and self-explanatory. The Jets have no further comment at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots felt the ruling was a Jets-NFL matter and declined
comment.

 &HT;    Iowa caucuses won't decide GOP nomination
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRINNELL, Iowa _ In the weird expectations game that is
presidential politics, don't expect Monday's Iowa caucuses to
settle much about the race for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After all the news and noise, the status quo will likely survive
the first-in-the-nation event that will be played out at 2,162
evening caucuses across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a heartland surprise, the chase for the Republican
nomination will look much the same on Tuesday morning as it does
now: Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be the favorite, Arizona Sen.
John McCain will be his leading rival and publisher Steve Forbes
will be investing personal money contrary to what the risk-reward
calculation says is prudent. Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch
still will be running in the face of a simple question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   According to polls and pundits, Bush is heading for a fairly
solid Iowa win that won't decide anything. That's because McCain is
not playing here, opting instead to concentrate on New Hampshire.
Bush is hoping to top the 37 percent that stands as the best Iowa
GOP caucus performance, a feat that polls indicate he can
accomplish easily. But McCain's absence saps meaning from Bush's
probable win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Bush said on the Iowa campaign trail, ``victory
might not mean victory. I hope it means it in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to an expectations game that could make for hollow
victories and defeats that spin into success. Most likely, it means
Iowa may mean little in the long run, serving only to pave the way
for crucial McCain-Bush showdowns in New Hampshire on Feb. 1 and,
perhaps, South Carolina on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The self-set expectations for the GOP front-runner are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come in first place,'' Bush said. ``I've said I
thought 37 percent would be a pretty good total. After all, it's
the highest any person has got in Republican caucuses (in Iowa) in
a crowded field.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, though, that candidates do not set expectations
they are not sure they can meet. Any candidate who says he is
hoping to get 37 percent is expecting to get significantly more.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the problem with 37 percent, or anything less than 50
percent, is that it allows opponents to note that more people voted
against him than for him. But a win is a win, and the low-ball
target set by Bush is the 37 percent Bob Dole got in 1988 when he
eventually lost the nomination to Bush's dad.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, setting himself up for a post-Iowa victory speech
despite skipping the event, also has set a goal he expects to top
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``About, hmmmmm,'' he said during a recent rare visit to Iowa,
pretending to be engaged in thoughtful calculation, ``I think maybe
1 percent would be victory.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Friday indicates Bush has a shot at getting more
than half the votes at the Monday caucuses. The University of
Iowa's Heartland poll, taken over the past two weeks, showed Bush
at 54 percent, Forbes at 18 percent, Keyes at 6 percent and McCain
and Bauer tied at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCain is not competing here, he and Bush are
focused on each other. This week, the two skirmished over the size
and details of their respective tax plans. By Friday, both were
running TV ads in New Hampshire and trading accusations on the
stump (Bush in Iowa, McCain in South Carolina) over who went on the
attack first.
</P>
<P>
   In the caucus battle, University of Iowa political scientist
Arthur Miller sees something of a no-win situation for the probable
winner and a no-lose situation for the noncontender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain ends up in the top three or four without having done
anything, I guess he could say look how well he did though he did
nothing in Iowa,'' Miller said. ``And if he doesn't do that well, I
guess he won't say anything and, when asked, he will say, `I didn't
compete there.'''
</P>
<P>
   And in the twisted world of political expectations, Bush and
Forbes, consistently one-two in the pre-caucus polls here, may not
be able to gain much by finishing that way.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, looking through the expectations lens, sees little
good happening for Forbes or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush can't win anything. And what is Forbes going to gain by
coming in second?'' Miller asked. ``From most people's perspective
he will have wasted a lot of money and time and gained nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes a solid win here can provide a boost going into
New Hampshire. But Miller says it may not be much of an achievement
for a candidate with a budget that looks like the gross national
product of a small country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be careful that the story coming out of Iowa is
not with all that money and all that effort why didn't you do
better,'' Miller said. ``What is the expected number for Bush?
Thirty-seven percent? For God's sake, with all the money he spent,
if this guy doesn't get 50 percent I'd say that's not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange game, isn't it?'' Miller asked.
</P>
<P>
   The defining battles will come in New Hampshire and South
Carolina. For McCain, who is trying to build a national campaign on
a four-state foundation (add Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22)
skipping Iowa will work out OK. But it puts more pressure on New
Hampshire, where polls show him with a slight lead over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's the expectations game. Three months ago, when Bush
looked unbeatable just about everywhere, a five-point win in New
Hampshire might have looked surprisingly close. But now, thanks to
McCain's surge, a two-point Bush win in New Hampshire could leave
McCain on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the Iowa and New Hampshire outcomes (and a
Delaware primary on Feb. 9 that is drawing relatively little
attention), the Bush camp is confident of a big-margin win in South
Carolina. Recent polls give Bush a 20 to 30 percentage-point edge,
though McCain has shown some positive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that Bush was solid in Iowa came during the
August straw poll run by the state GOP. Bush picked up 31 percent
of the 24,000 votes. Forbes was second with 21 percent. Elizabeth
Dole, now an ex-candidate backing Bush, was third with 14 percent.
McCain didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa battle will be played out among 100,000 or so
Republicans who are expected to show up for the 7 p.m. caucuses.
It's more of a battle for momentum than delegates. Iowa sends only
25 delegates to the national convention. It takes 1,034 to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, for all its cash and sophistication, is
counting on a system not unlike the one used to make sure everyone
knows the PTA meeting has been cancelled. Eric Woolson, Bush's Iowa
spokesman, is counting on a phone-tree network, headed by area
captains, to make sure Bush backers get to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid people won't vote,'' Bush said Friday during a
walking tour of downtown Grinnell, where it was an invigorating 13
degrees. ``The thing I've got to fear is people not showing up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   By 6 p.m. the Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs were lining up for valet
parking at Goose Creek, the luxurious private screening room tucked
in the basement of Bryan Bantry's mansion in Wainscott, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as always, came the slinky procession of celebrities,
Kelly Klein, Eric Fischl, Christie Brinkley, Kim Cattrall of ``Sex
and the City'' and writer Richard Price among them. Stopping to
bestow hugs and air kisses on a publicist who had arranged the
event for ``Magnolia,'' the 1999 film featuring Tom Cruise, and the
intimate dinner at Alison by the Beach that would follow, they
scanned the room for other regulars from the Hamptons-Hollywood
axis.
</P>
<P>
   But something about the crowd was not Hamptons as usual. Instead
of the flimsy Tracy Feith sheaths or Gucci linen cocktail dresses,
the women shivered slightly in ski parkas or goatskin jackets. The
men wore cashmere sweaters over their black turtlenecks. Ms. Klein
looked a bit shattered to hear that there was only white wine at
the bar. After all, it was nearly December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say we make hot toddies the official drink out here,'' Ms.
Klein's handsome escort said. The suggestion was greeted with
applause.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that just a few years ago would have been
unthinkable. The East End of Long Island, N.Y., swollen in the
summer by the wealthy, the famous and the tourists, used to be a
ghost town in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus began as the last barbecues of August were
extinguished. By the time the foliage turned brown, most
restaurants were shut, entire blocks of tony shops were locked and
the Montauk Highway, a two-lane parking lot for luxury cars in
August, was a lonely stretch of blacktop. Except for local
residents, all that remained were a handful of writers hanging out
at a dark table at Bobby Van's in Bridgehampton, N.Y., as
chronicled in ``The Boys of Winter,'' Wilfrid Sheed's 1987 ode to
the oddball literary life in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   No more. As the economy has thrived, the Hamptons have changed
over the past decade. With day-trippers, rap star entourages and
traffic jams now as much a part of the summer scene as fresh corn
and cloudless afternoons on the beach, many people who own summer
homes can find peace only when the season ends. And so, over the
past few years, the East End has come alive in the winter with
Manhattan refugees looking for a getaway, albeit one dusted with
frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The not-so-secret truth is that now if you want to experience
the Hamptons like they once were, 20 years ago, you come out here
to your house in January,'' said Jerry Della Femina, who owns
restaurants in both Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y. ``It's
bustling, but manageable. And best of all, the August people are
gone, gone, gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores are open and restaurants that were shuttered last season
are jammed. Caterers are juggling multiple parties. It's hard to
book a manicure. A rising number of actors, artists and writers
have moved to the beach full time, including Spalding Gray, Alan
Alda, Roy Scheider and Andre Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   Mingling quietly with the new homeowners out for the weekend,
they are providing a low-key glamour reminiscent of the days before
the arrival of Puffy Combs, Martha Stewart and the kinds of
celebrities who don't mind having their footsteps dogged by
television crews from ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer-home owners who feel put out by the over-the-top social
scene are braving bleak skies in an attempt to recapture the
mythical atmosphere that first lured them to the tip of Long
Island, be it the blue-blood clubbiness of Southampton, N.Y., or
the elegant intellectualism of East Hampton. They haven't exactly
recreated the East End summers of yore, when John Steinbeck, the
Bouviers and Jackson Pollock roamed the macadam in anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The scene now evokes less the casual cool of the '50s _ mint
juleps on Willie Morris' porch and cocktails in Willem de Kooning's
studio _ than the quaintness of Currier &AMP; Ives.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent 40-degree Saturday afternoon, it was hard to find a
parking space in Southampton or East Hampton Village. Nearly every
store was open, and dozens of shoppers darted in and out. In East
Hampton, a large group of children played pickup hockey on a frozen
pond as parents stood by proudly, leaning on Range Rovers and
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgehampton, the Candy Kitchen, a luncheonette that is
jammed on summer weekends, was pleasantly alive with a dozen or so
customers. At the Sip 'n' Soda in Southampton, a group of
socialites, including the decorator Joanne de Guardiola, huddled
over chicken salad sandwiches and hamburgers. Ms. de Guardiola said
she and her husband, Roberto, an investment banker, now came out
most winter weekends, as did most of their set. But since the
Bathing Corp., their private beach club, is closed for the season,
she and the ladies who lunch make the Sip 'n' Soda their home away
from home. ``It's so comforting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season on the East End needn't preclude an afternoon of
luxurious beauty treatments. Naturopathica, a day spa in East
Hampton, was fully booked on a recent weekend, and weekend
appointments are generally gone by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While there are more organized events in the Hamptons in the
winter than ever _ Peggy Siegal, a publicist, arranges as many as
half a dozen screenings and parties in the off-season _ these are
not the vast tented blowouts of summer. In winter, the events are
small private gatherings where pretty much everyone is A list and _
astonishingly _ photographers are not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of the socializing happens at home. Now that there
is a critical mass of weekenders, a cold-weather dinner party
circuit has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real pleasure,'' said Adair Beutel, the wife of the
newscaster Bill Beutel, ``is that in the winter there are no huge
functions, no benefits. We just get six or eight people and sit
around the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that these days most of the new ``cottages'' are fully
insulated. Many of the newer, grander models have fireplaces and
formal dining rooms that can seat 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are even passing up the Caribbean getaway for the
homey Hamptons during the holidays. Ina Garten, the owner of the
Barefoot Contessa, a fancy-food shop in East Hampton, said that for
the past couple of years, New Year's has been the busiest holiday
of the year, outstripping Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and
Labor Day. This New Year's Eve, the Hamptons were a hot spot, with
elaborate parties put on by Ahmet Ertegun and by George Plimpton
and Lorne Michaels among the most elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But in keeping with the vogue for scaled-down coziness, Ms.
Garten said, most people preferred a small gathering. She catered
dozens of New Year's Eve dinner parties, including one for Tom
Florio, publisher of GQ magazine, in a partly renovated farmhouse
in Southampton. ``We had just seven couples,'' Florio said. ``There
were long tapers on the tables illuminating this very rustic place.
It was fabulously low-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The new influx of winter weekenders is a boon for restaurants as
well. Until recently, the only choices on a Saturday night in
February were a couple of burger places and bars that catered to
local people. But this year, for the first time, nearly all the
trendy, expensive restaurants are remaining open all year. And they
are filled with patrons, many of whom would balk at the idea of
setting foot in such ``sceney'' places during the high season, when
reservations generally have to be made weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' said artist Donald Sultan, who has a house
in Sag Harbor, N.Y. ``You can have a great, civilized time.''

<P>
   By Hamptons standards, however, crowds that are considered
merely festive might seem overwhelming to others. It may not be
necessary to book a restaurant table weeks ahead, but there are
certainly no walk-ins.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent chilly Saturday evening in January, Redbar in
Southampton and the nearby Peconic Coast were full. In East
Hampton, patrons of the Palm and Della Femina had to wait at the
bar. Cars overflowed the parking lot at Alison by the Beach in
Sagaponack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina said he had planned to close his restaurant in East
Hampton in January and February, but ended up staying open because
bookings were so robust.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to deny that, shorn of its cornstalks and its roadside
vegetable stands, the flat South Fork lacks the wintry charms of
hilly Litchfield County, Conn. An afternoon drive along Montauk
Highway, awash in strip malls, can be bleak. But the residents
don't seem to mind. ``There is nothing like loading the dogs into
the car and going to the beach,'' said writer Ken Auletta. He and
his wife, literary agent Amanda Urban, spend half their winter
weekends in Bridgehampton.
</P>
<P>
   Auletta and his friends _ who include Nora Ephron and her
husband, Nicholas Pileggi, and Washington Post columnist Richard
Cohen _ favor activities that make it seem as if summer never
ended. They move their tennis game off the clay courts to the East
Hampton Indoor Tennis Club. Opened in 1995, the club can
accommodate 480 people each weekend. It has been fully booked every
weekend this winter.
</P>
<P>
   People are also riding horses indoors. Developer David Walentas
is an avid polo player who practices nearly every weekend with a
band of friends. Ms. Beutel rides at the Sag Pond Farms stable,
along with more than a dozen regular riders. ``These days fewer
people ship their horses to Palm Beach for the winter,'' said
Christian Wolffer, who owns the stable. ``There is more of a
comfortable scene here.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest winter sport on the East End is actually one that has
been resurrected: the original Southampton pastime of pheasant
hunting. Spring Farms, a 200-acre preserve in Sag Harbor, hires out
guides, guns and hunting dogs. ``It's very gentlemanly,'' Florio
said. ``It's become the official beginning of the winter season.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is thriving in the new winter Hampton
economy. One industry, in fact, seems to have been crippled by the
influx of year-round weekenders. ``The housebreaking business has
gone down the tubes,'' Della Femina said. The Southampton Town
police confirmed that burglaries had dropped sharply in the past
three years. ``It used to be that people would close up their
houses and the burglary business would heat up,'' Della Femina
said. ``Now, that's really shot.''

<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ Assailed by his more conservative opponents
as being equivocal on abortion, Gov. George W. Bush declared Friday
that the Supreme Court in its landmark Roe vs. Wade decision
``stepped across its bounds and usurped the right of
legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the comment itself was not a striking shift for Bush,
who has always been opposed to abortion, it came on the second day
in a row in which he has been pressed to discuss the issue, and it
seemed to highlight the influence that social and religious
conservatives have traditionally held in the Republican caucuses
here.
</P>
<P>
   With the caucuses only three days away, both Bush and his main
challenger here, Steve Forbes, made strong appeals to
conservatives, with Bush delivering pious remarks to recovering
drug and alcohol abusers as Forbes continued to attack Bush's
abortion positions.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the pulpit of a chapel at a faith-based
rehabilitation center in Colfax, Bush told several dozen men that
he once had his own problems with alcohol and had moved past them
with the aid of his religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a walk, just like you are,'' Bush said Friday morning.
``I'm on a walk. And it's a never-ending walk, as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to one of the nation's most prominent Christian
preachers, Bush added: ``I used to drink too much, and I quit
drinking, and I believe it was because Billy Graham planted a seed
in my heart one time. It wasn't Billy; he was the messenger. So I
want you to know your life's walk is shared by a lot of other
people, even some who wear suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher who is running second to
Bush in polls in Iowa, continued, meanwhile, to emphasize his
opposition to abortion, to portray Bush's own position on the issue
as unacceptably soft and to present himself as the voice of true
moral conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Cedar Rapids, Forbes complained that Bush was a
``strong moderate'' who ``would not give a direct answer'' on such
conservative goals as the repeal of Roe vs. Wade. And, he
criticized Bush for not pledging to have an anti-abortion running
mate or appoint only anti-abortion judges if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush won't give a real answer on Roe v. Wade,'' Forbes said.
``He ducked on that, and he ducked on the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between the two men illustrated the rightward tilt
of the Republican debate as the candidates focus their time and
energy in this state over the days leading up to the precinct
caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 1, Bush and
several other Republican candidates generally pay less heed to
moral issues and more to economic ones, like the duel over tax cuts
between Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has not
campaigned actively in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the altered tenor of the Republican appeals in Iowa is
likely to repeat itself in South Carolina, the next major contest
after New Hampshire. Like Iowa, South Carolina is fertile soil for
socially conservative views and appeals. Campaigning there Friday,
McCain was grilled about his position on abortion at a town-hall
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, has been pressed about abortion over the last few
days, in part because of statements that Forbes has made on the
stump. And Bush has made it clearer than he has on some other
occasions that he strongly disapproves of the 1973 Supreme Court
decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade, which established the right
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of
what the legislatures do in America,'' Bush said in Colfax Friday,
reiterating comments he had made on Thursday. ``That's the case
where the court stepped across its bounds and usurped the right of
legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he thought the decision should be
overturned, Bush said, ``It should be up to each legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer seemed to reflect Bush's carefully calibrated
position on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion: He favors
one, but has said he would not fight for it because the requisite
public support does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response also underscored the challenge he faces as he
navigates the Republican primaries. If he veers too far to the
right, he risks losing the kind of centrist appeal he will need to
win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems acutely aware of that, although his advisers say he
is simply holding to unchanging principles or genuinely modulated
views.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican debates over the last few weeks, he has
resisted rightward tugs from his rivals on several issues. He
declined, for example, to call for a reinstatement of the ban on
gays in the military, nor would he vow that any judges he nominates
to the Supreme Court be opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's pitch in Iowa this week has been undeniably different
from his appeal in New Hampshire, whose voters love a good tax cut.
There, Bush put the bulk of his oratorical muscle into selling his
plan to slash taxes by $483 billion over the next five years. Here,
Bush has mentioned that proposal only briefly and used some of the
time left over to talk about morality and family.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has been fairly subtle; most of Bush's campaign
appearances here since he arrived on Wednesday night have not had
religious overtones. But his aides here have distributed a pamphlet
that calls attention to Bush's support from the National Right to
Life Committee. The pamphlet includes an open letter from Bush, in
which he reflects on religion and on his friendship with Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Bush writes: ``My faith frees me; frees me to put the problems
of the moment in proper perspective; frees me to make decisions
that others might not like.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush may need the votes of many Christian conservatives to meet
or exceed the lofty expectations for a resounding victory here. But
several other candidates, including Forbes, Gary L. Bauer and Alan
Keyes, are relying principally on these voters and wooing them more
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, seeking to establish himself as the sole conservative
alternative to Bush, has called Bush a ``pro-life pacifist'' in
public comments here this week and is running a television
commercial in which a woman says, ``If someone kills a pet, it's
called a crime. If someone aborts a child, it's called a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The potential power of religious conservatives was demonstrated
in a recent poll by The Des Moines Register, which showed that over
40 percent of Republicans in the state identified themselves as
``born again'' Christians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To succeed, Forbes must hold off Bush in his efforts to grab
part of this vote while not lose votes to candidates like Bauer and
Keyes, who are perceived to be even more conservative than Forbes
by many on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly aware of that possibility, Forbes urged conservatives
here to rally around him as the conservative alternative to Bush,
``since I have the strongest message, the broadest-based message.''

STRIKERS DISREGARD VOTE TO REOPEN UNIVERSITY IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Students, faculty and workers of the national
university, worn out by a nine-month strike, voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a plan by its president to return to class, results of
a Thursday referendum showed Friday. But the strikers who have
paralyzed the enormous campus since April refused to recognize the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 177,000 of the 333,000 people affiliated with the
university voted in the ``plebiscite'' organized by its president,
Juan Ramon de la Fuente. At least 88 percent of the students and
faculty approved his plan to suspend tuition payments indefinitely
and organize a special congress, drawing from all parts of the
university, to carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The show of support was even stronger than de la Fuente had
expected in his high-stakes gamble to break the deadlock. He had
said that 125,000 votes would be enough to give him a mandate to
bargain more forcefully with the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal has won a consensus for the university to
reunite,'' he said, with visible relief, at the close of balloting
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal yields to the strikers on most major
points, but does not reinstate open admissions, as they have
demanded, or cancel limits on how long a student can be enrolled
without graduating.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers, as they have done time and again, quickly
dismissed the administration's effort as a sham. On Tuesday and
Wednesday the strikers held their own competing referendum, in
which they said that 86,329 members of the university voted for the
strike to continue until every demand was met.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers' referendum was chaotic, and a number of
observers reported a much lower turnout than the strikers claimed.
Unlike the president's vote, the strikers took no measures to
require identification from voters or to stop them from voting
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare their vote to ours because theirs is a
fraud,'' said Ana Maria Hanan, a political science student,
announcing the strike council's decision. ``It was just designed to
capitalize on the desperation in the university to pave the way to
use violence against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still no end in sight to the protest, de la
Fuente now has an important new tool with which to turn up the
pressure on strike leaders. With 275,000 students, the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, is Latin America's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of attrition in the strike movement. Friday
morning, students at one major high school associated with the
university decided to end their strike and release the school to
UNAM administrators. But de la Fuente decided not to take back any
buildings without a general settlement, and radical strikers
quickly re-occupied the high school.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente, a former health minister who stepped in as
president on Nov. 17, has succeeded almost single-handedly in
mobilizing a passive majority in the university that has long
opposed the strike but was also put off by the remote and imperious
style of the former university president, Francisco Barnes de
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist who was trained at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., de la Fuente went in person to meetings in every department
to sound out opinions, enduring an acid bath of criticism about how
the giant university functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get people involved so we eventually can turn over
this black page and go back to classes without rancor or revenge,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally put a human face on the administration,'' said
Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor who has been a constant
critic of the administration. Like many in his department, Alvarez,
a former student leader, supported the strike at first. But after
he began to question it in July, strikers called him a traitor and
broke into his offices to steal the computer that contained much of
his research.

HMO CHIEF'S MOVE LED TO LOSSES, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Charles D. Baker Jr.'s attempt to launch a turnaround
of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care last spring may have inadvertently
caused millions of dollars in losses to go undetected until the
``January surprise'' that plunged the giant HMO into state
receivership earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals inside and outside Harvard Pilgrim confirm that the
HMO chief executive's decision to terminate month-to-month
accounting help made it inevitable that the health plan would have
no idea of its true fiscal state during a crucial six-month period
when losses mounted.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve Harvard Pilgrim's disjointed computer
accounting system, Baker launched a massive restructuring shortly
after taking the health plan's reins last May.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring included among other things layoffs and job
changes for key people in Harvard Pilgrim's finance and computer
network management departments. But it also included firing the
accountant firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which had been hired by
Harvard Pilgrim's previous management to help keep track of
day-to-day expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with the past, Baker decided to handle the accounting
functions internally.
</P>
<P>
   While his restructuring may yet result in long-term
improvements, his actions removed the people who apparently knew
how to cobble together an accurate, up-to-date picture of Harvard
Pilgrim's expenses from the health plan's eight separate accounting
systems, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who knew how to make sense of everything were
suddenly gone, and there was no way to keep track of everything
anymore,'' said one person familiar with Harvard Pilgrim's
finances. ``None of us were surprised to see these losses pop up at
the first of the year. It was almost inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker declined to be interviewed on the subject, citing an
agreement with insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt and Attorney
General Thomas Reilly, who are in charge of the health plan's
affairs. ``It's something best addressed by the regulators, who are
reviewing everything,'' Harvard Pilgrim spokesman Alan Raymond
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim was placed in receivership Jan. 4 after health
plan officials said they discovered an additional $58.5 million in
1999 losses. At least $20 million of those losses went undetected
because they were never transferred from one computer accounting
system to the health plan's general ledger, which is kept on
another, separate computer system, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's massive losses in the past two years
originated well before Baker's arrival, regulators have said. And
most industry experts say measures used by the health plan's
previous management to track expenses in the dissarray of its
computer networks only forstalled inevitable trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the health plan might not have been taken over by the state
had it not been for the sudden discovery of losses this month _ a
development that forced state officials to move quickly to avoid
panic by members and an onslaught of creditors' lawsuits,
regulators have said. And as they comb Harvard Pilgrim's records,
regulators have said said they will be searching for reasons such
massive losses could have accumulated unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear that the losses discovered this month would have
been detected earlier if key people had remained in place at
Harvard Pilgrim. But sources said Baker's new management team had
virtually no chance to uncover them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreasonable to think they could have got up to speed,''
a second source said. Baker ``was under enormous political pressure
internally to do something and to start with a clean slate. But he
understimated how complex and how fragile the system was, and the
knowledge required to spot those losses wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   One key role was played by Harvard Pilgrim's outside auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition to putting together Harvard
Pilgrim's annual audit, the firm helped balance the health plan's
books once a month and provided a variety of other consulting
services meant to improve accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants participated in monthly
``closing'' sessions where they helped identify losses that Harvard
Pilgrim's internal auditors missed, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The auditing firm was ``a very major presence'' from the fall of
1998 through last spring, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a serious information gap between the computer
systems, a great deal of fragmentation, and they were brought in to
do a lot of projects to fill in that gap,'' the source said. But
after Baker arrived in May, ``the decision was made to discontinue
that. The thinking was to do more of that in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   The move had little to do with the large fees Harvard Pilgrim
was paying the firm, which totalled $4.1 million in 1998, according
to Harvard Pilgrim's most recent public financial disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm was widely perceived as being closely tied to
Harvard Pilgrim's former chief executive Allan I. Greenberg and
chief financial officer Thomas Brophy, both of whom left abruptly
last spring after the health plan posted unprecedented losses of
$54 million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the health plan's board and from members of
his new exceutive team to rid the organization of old-guard
vestiges, Baker ``made a judgment call'' in reducing
PricewaterhouseCooper's role, a source familar with the situation
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's computer accounting system has been a main
source of the financial debacle it's now mired in. In its hunger
for rapid expansion, Harvard Pilgrim never successfully integrated
new computer systems as it bought up new plans in the late 1980s
and early '90s. Instead, each was left to operate on its own, often
with unique coding and patient ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Community Health Plan merged with Pilgrim Health Care in
1995, and experienced its first serious signs of trouble three
years later as it tried to weave together systems from both plans.
</P>
<P>
   The systems ``could not handle the magnitude of claims that
required processing on a daily basis,'' according to a report by
Moody's Investors Service released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Without accurate accounting for claims, Harvard Pilgrim could do
little more than guess at what its true expenses were, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Between October 1998 and March 1999, a period when problems were
mounting, Harvard Pilgrim's old management attempted to upgrade the
computer system to handle new growth.
</P>
<P>
   But claims problems only worsened, according to the Moody's
report, and health care providers began to see long delays in
reimbursements for claims.

HIGH COURT ACCEPTS CASES ON DISABILITY BIAS AND `BLANKET' PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Ala., Wash., La.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its appetite for examining the federal-state
balance of power evidently far from exhausted by a spate of recent
rulings, the Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would decide
whether state governments are bound by the federal law against
discrimination in employment on the basis of disability.
</P>
<P>
   While the answer to that question, in the uniform view of the
lower federal courts, had been clearly ``yes'' until last year, the
Supreme Court's recent decisions carving out an ever-expanding
sphere of immunity for the states from the reach of federal law
have sown growing doubt. The Clinton administration urged the
justices to use this latest case to resolve that doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by the state of Florida from a 1998 ruling
in which a federal appeals court rejected the state's claim of
immunity from suit by a prison guard. The guard, Wellington
Dickson, sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act, claiming
that the state had withheld a promotion because of his heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also accepted a second case on Friday, a
constitutional challenge to a California law permitting voters of
any political affiliation to vote in primary elections for
candidates for any party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   California's ``blanket primary'' law is broader than the more
typical ``open primary'' authorized by some two dozen states, under
which members of one party may vote in another party's primary.
Under California's Proposition 198, a voter can select, for
example, a Democratic nominee for governor, a Republican nominee
for the U.S. Senate and a minor party candidate for the state
assembly. Four political parties in the state are challenging the
law as an infringement of their First Amendment right of free
association. California's blanket primary law is similar to systems
in Alaska, Washington and Louisiana. In the Florida discrimination
case, the state is arguing that it is constitutionally immune from
suit under the federal law and that Congress lacked authority to
make the 1990 law applicable to the states.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the court's recent rulings, this argument has
indisputable force. Last week, the justices ruled 5-4 that states
were immune from suit under the federal law against age
discrimination. Last June, the court ruled, by the same margin,
that employees cannot sue states for violating the federal labor
law governing minimum wages and hours.
</P>
<P>
   To decide the disability case, Florida Department of Corrections
vs. Dickson, No. 98-829, the court may have to define more clearly
than it has in the past the level of constitutional scrutiny that
should be applied to discrimination by public agencies on the basis
of disability.
</P>
<P>
   That technical-sounding issue is important because Congress'
authority to make the Americans with Disabilities Act binding on
the states, and to overcome the states' 11th Amendment immunity
from suit in federal court, depends largely on whether the court
sees the law as a proper exercise of Congressional authority to
enforce the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the age discrimination case last week, Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the
majority that because differential treatment on the basis of age
does not violate equal protection as long as it is minimally
rational, Congress' imposition of the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act on the states was ``disproportionate to any
unconstitutional conduct that conceivably could be targeted by the
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The court has treated disability, like age, as subject to
minimal constitutional scrutiny _ as opposed to classifications
like race or sex, which get ``strict'' or at least ``heightened''
scrutiny. However, there is language in various court precedents
dealing with disability indicating the views of at least some
justices that discrimination on the basis of disability can be
invidious, based on animus or stereotypes, and necessitating
something more than the lowest rung of equal protection analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In the age discrimination case last week, Justice O'Connor said
that ``old age does not define a discrete and insular minority
because all persons, if they live out their normal life spans, will
experience it.'' That formulation did not rule out the prospect of
treating disability differently than age. In fact, by agreeing to
decide this case, the court was at least tacitly indicating that it
perceived an analytical difference between disability and age that
it needed to address; had it not, the justices could simply have
sent the case back for reconsideration by the 11th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals. To decide the new case, the court is also likely
to inquire into whether Congress, in passing the disability law 10
years ago, compiled a record showing that states, as employers,
were discriminating against people with disabilities. In the age
discrimination ruling last week, the court said that ``Congress had
virtually no reason to believe'' that states were discriminating
against their older employers.
</P>
<P>
   The California primary case requires the court to confront an
issue on which it has been sharply divided in the past: the extent
to which a political party's First Amendment right to define its
own rules for membership and organization can trump contrary state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   California's blanket primary law, was adopted in 1996 as a voter
initiative, Proposition 198. The state's party organizations
opposed it, but it passed with nearly 60 percent of the vote,
including a majority of registered Democrats, Republicans and
independents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of losing control of their nominating process, the
Republican and Democratic parties, along with the Libertarian Party
and the Peace and Freedom Party, went to federal court to block the
law. They lost, both in U.S. District Court in Sacramento and last
year in the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said that whether the blanket primary proved
to be a good or a bad idea, it was an expression of the voters'
desire for an end to partisan strife and for ``a more
representative and participatory system,'' an expression with which
the federal courts should not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   In their Supreme Court appeal, California Democratic Party vs.
Jones, No. 99-401, the four parties are arguing that the appeals
court decision was inconsistent with a 1986 Supreme Court ruling in
a Connecticut case that held that the state's Republican Party had
a First Amendment right to open its primary to independent voters
despite a state law requiring closed, partisan primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in that case, Tashjian vs. Republican Party, was 5-4;
while the five justices in the majority have left the court, the
four dissenters _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and John Paul Stevens remain. Whether the
1986 case is now open for reconsideration is one intriguing element
in the new case.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the analytical connection between the California case
and the case the court accepted last week on whether the Boy Scouts
have a right to exclude gay leaders. Both depend on interpreting
the First Amendment's protection for association, adding even more
interest to an already weighty term. Both the new cases on Friday,
as well as the Boy Scouts case, will be argued in April and decided
by early summer.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S GRANDMOTHERS COME TO U.S. PLEADING TO TAKE GRANDSON HOME
TO CUBA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   MIAMI _ There were tears, pleas and angry words Friday as the
two Cuban grandmothers of 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez came to
the United States in a bid to bring their grandson home.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic trip organized by church leaders who hoped they
might reunite a family fractured by political differences appeared
instead to spark a new round of rhetoric and posturing as the icy
stand-off over the boy continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come so we can end this great tragedy ... so you'll let us
take our grandson back to Cuba as soon as possible to our home,''
Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said at a news
conference shortly after arriving at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York .
</P>
<P>
   But Quintana made it clear the two women have no plans to travel
to Miami to visit Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about going to the house,'' she said. ``They
have no right to keep the child there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's relatives watched the news conference in the
Little Havana home where the boy has stayed since he was rescued at
sea on Thanksgiving Day. Elian looked briefly at the television set
as his grandmothers spoke, but then went back to playing with his
toys, the family told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that while they would welcome the grandmothers
into their home, they would not take the boy to meet them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``I
want them to see how comfortable he is in this house and how much
love and attention he gets. And I have a lot of questions in my
mind for them. I haven't seen a tear from her eyes asking about her
daughter,'' she said, referring to Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, whose daughter _ Elian's mother _ drowned on
the ill-fated voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments in the saga surrounding the boy seemed
to indicate that it might be weeks or longer before a resolution to
the tense stand-off is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to
overturn a decision by U.S. immigration officials to send the boy
back to his father in Cuba. On Friday, the judge initially assigned
to the case, U.S. District Judge James L. King, stepped aside. King
cited several possible conflicts, including his crowded trial
schedule and connections between his son, a Miami-Dade County
judge, and a spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and Attorney General
Janet Reno, named as defendants in the case, are expected to file a
response to the Miami family's complaint on Monday, perhaps
clearing the way for the legal proceedings to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the grandmothers seemed likely to have little
bearing on the legal case, although some observers speculated that
attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives might attempt to subpoena the
women to make them testify in court.
</P>
<P>
   In another upcoming twist in the case, several members of
Congress have promised to introduce bills when they convene on
Monday to grant Elian U.S. citizenship or permanent residency,
which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   For the weekend, however, it appeared the massive media
attention on the case would focus on the two grandmothers. The
women are expected to stay in this country for only a few days,
said a spokesman for the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant church group favors returning the boy to Cuba,
and chartered the jet to bring the grandmothers to New York. They
did not go to Miami out of fears over the explosive atmosphere
here, where Cuban exiles have vowed to form a human chain to keep
the boy in this country, said group spokesman Robert Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   After the women's news conference, Jorge Mas Santos, head of the
powerful Cuban American National Foundation, said Miami's exiles
would warmly welcome the grandmothers here.
</P>
<P>
   But he also blasted their remarks, which he labeled a
``charade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself why these two grandmothers aren't here in Miami
to hug and hold their grandson,'' he said. ``Instead they are in
New York repeating the propaganda of Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   In their news conference, the women sidestepped the question of
why Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, didn't join them on their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need to be here because that is what the
grandmothers are here for,'' said Rodriguez. Elian's father has
said he would never come to this country, partly because he fears
he would be a target for Cuban exile extremists and because he
believes his son should be returned without such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers' immediate plans remained unclear. There were
reports they would meet with members of Congress from New York who
favor returning Elian to Cuba, and that they might visit
Washington, perhaps to meet with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear was that little Elian will likely remain at the
center of the dizzying media swirl and angry tug-of-war that has
surrounded him now for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you and beg you ... to do everything possible so the boy
will be given to us so my daughter can rest in peace,'' said
Rodriguez.

FOR BRADLEY, HEART ISSUE COMES AS CAMPAIGN FALTERS

<P>
   DES MOINES _ The disco beat still rocks the events on Bill
Bradley's campaign trail. ``Ain't no stoppin' us now,'' the song
blares as he ambles into the room. ``We're on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   But after more than a year on the run, building momentum as he
barnstormed from Salem, N.H., to Sioux City, Iowa, Bradley has lost
some of the bounce in his campaign step as he approaches a major
crossroad on the path to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust on the defensive by new disclosures about his heart
condition and Vice President Al Gore's attacks on his agenda,
Bradley Friday was pressing ahead by bus from Muscatine to Clinton,
Iowa, as his strategists sought a dose of political adrenaline to
reignite his campaign before Monday's Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 1
primary in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls indicate Bradley has stalled in Iowa,
where he trails Gore by 20 points, and lost ground in New
Hampshire. One tracking poll Friday showed Bradley slipping behind
Gore in the Granite State after protecting a slim, but significant,
edge there for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, this is a tough time for Bill Bradley,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, a campaign analyst and editor of the
Washington-based Rothenberg Political Report. ``It looks like the
momentum he had a month ago has all but evaporated and he's trying
to hold on.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the apparent slippage, Bradley and his staff are searching
for reasons, a self-analysis that has generated some disagreement
over how to proceed. Most notably, Bradley remains steadfastly
opposed to matching the tough ads that Gore has run against him in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is some concern behind the scenes that
Bradley should have responded more vigorously to Gore's most
stinging attacks on him, particulary Gore's claim that Bradley
showed little concern as a senator for Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, you don't do everything perfectly,'' Bradley's
spokesman, Eric Hauser, said recently. ``Sometimes, they don't
happen the way you want them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, at a poor time for a presidential campaign, remained on
the defensive Friday as he entered the final weekend before the
Iowa caucuses. A day after disclosing that he had experienced four
additional abnormal heart rhythms since an irregularity in December
prompted him to seek hospital care, Bradley continued to field
queries from voters and reporters about his condition, atrial
fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent erratic heart rhythm occurred last Sunday in
Waterloo, Iowa, on the eve of his final debate with Gore in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual self-diagnosis, Bradley Friday theorized to
reporters that his recent abnormalities may have been triggered by
his consumption of diet cream soda. He said he had switched during
the campaign from drinking Gatorade and orange soda to downing A&AMP;W
diet cream soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew that cream soda had caffeine in it?'' Bradley said,
noting that caffeine is seen as a possible contributor to his
abnormal rhythms. ``I have curtailed my cream soda.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his current beverage of choice is diet orange soda.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the first question Bradley fielded at a morning event in
Muscatine came from a woman who said she was concerned about his
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very common condition, and it has absolutely no
impact on your ability to campaign,'' Bradley told the woman,
adding that it would not affect his ability to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should feel reassured on that front,'' Bradley said.
``This is a nuisance for me, and shouldn't be a concern for you.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the attention on Bradley's heart condition has shifted
the focus away from his centerpiece issues, such as universal
health care, handgun control, and public financing of elections.
Rather than advocating racial tolerance, one of his key
initiatives, Bradley was largely occupied with medical questions.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign continued to refuse to fully release his medical
records, saying that all the relevant information about his heart
has already been made public. Aides said Bradley has no other
medical condition that is pertinent to his campaign for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in very good shape,'' said Bradley's communications
director, Anita Dunn. ``What else is there to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, well ahead in the polls here but insisting he will fight
for every last vote, downplayed Bradley's heart condition. ``My
understanding is that it's nothing serious,'' Gore told reporters
after meeting some children at the pediatric section of Des Moines'
Mercy Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there campaigning,'' Gore said. ''It's a routine
matter. That's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently has carried the confidence of a candidate who has
virtually taken the Iowa caucuses, but he is campaigning
relentlessly, sometimes making as many as six stops a day, to
secure the critical win.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, by nearly all accounts, is eager to return next Tuesday
to New Hampshire, where his candidacy has been far more warmly
embraced than in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has worked New Hampshire hard, investing much more money
on television ads that are broadcast into the state than Gore.
According to a Globe analysis, between Nov. 9 and Jan. 17, Bradley
had aired 1,168 minutes of commercials that cost $2.6 million
compared to 837 minutes that cost Gore $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers also believe Bradley has a more motivated
grass-roots organization in New Hampshire than Gore. And Bradley's
volunteers first started canvassing the state in July, dropping
literature well before the Gore campaign began knocking on doors
after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all that, tracking polls in the state have begun to
show a downward trend for Bradley and an uptick for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with questions about Bradley's heart condition, his
resistance to releasing medical records, and the likelihood of a
large loss in the Iowa caucuses, it's unclear whether Bradley's
constant spadework in New Hampshire will come to naught.
</P>
<P>
   But his supporters say they are undaunted. ``If you've been
through any of these before, you know that these things tend to ebb
and flow,'' said James Shannon, the former Massachusetts
congressman who recently spent a weekend knocking on doors for
Bradley in Goffstown.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said he is reminded of the 1992 New Hampshire primary,
when many observers thought Bill Clinton would not survive
questions about the draft and allegations of an affair with
Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `This is goodbye,' '' said Shannon. ``Every
campaign runs into these things. You just have to stand firm, keep
fighting and go with your gut. My gut has told me from the
beginning that this guy is connecting with people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rauh, one of Bradley's chief backers in the state, said the
disclosures about Bradley's heart only serve to demonstrate his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was asked a question, he answered it,'' said Rauh, who
believes there is a ``great spirit'' among the volunteers working
for Bradley, most of whom are housed by Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very different from the Gore campaign,'' Rauh
said of Bradley's youth brigade. ``They're not in it for what
they're going to get if he wins. They believe in Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign intends to maintain its positive message
next week, regardless of the Iowa results, said Mark Longabaugh,
the state director. The closing television spots are likely to
continue to present Bradley in a straightforward and unadorned
manner, either taking questions from voters or giving his stump
speech.

IOWA CAUCUS KNOWN TO PRODUCE FEW SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Jane Bejarno is such a fan of Vice President Al
Gore that she came out in the cold Friday to hear him talk about
health care. But despite her avid support for Gore, Bejarno, like
75 percent of Iowa's registered voters, does not plan to vote in
Monday's caucus. The long meeting is not worthwhile and, she
figures, Gore will win anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley, however, faces an even tougher
electorate. On paper, he should doing well here because the state's
biggest bloc of voters are Independents, whom he is counting on in
New Hampshire and elsewhere. But even though Independents can
re-register on caucus day, very few participate because caucuses
are so geared to party members. Bradley's political director
expects fewer than 2,000 people to re-register as Democrats out of
100,000 voters, vastly under-representing the state's Independents.
</P>
<P>
   This, as much as anything else occurring in the final, frantic
days of campaigning, is the story of the Iowa caucus. It is often
noted that the Iowa contest occurs in a mostly white, rural state
that is unrepresentative of America. But what is most surprising is
that caucus goers aren't even representative of Iowa _ and that
could determine who wins the presidential contests here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Independents are probably not going to
participate,'' said former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a
Republican who is backing George W. Bush and strongly defends the
caucus system. ``So, unlike New Hampshire, it is more ideological.
On the Democratic side, there are the unions, and on the Republican
side there is the influence of the Christian Coalition and
anti-abortion Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Iowans vote in small numbers, with
participation dominated by the extremes of each party, and without
the balancing effect of Independents. This filtering of the voter
pool helps explain why Bradley, trailing in the polls, complained
earlier this week that Iowa ``is a state that rewards entrenched
power,'' which was gleefully interpreted by the Gore campaign as a
criticism of the state's vaunted caucus system. It also helps
explain why Senator John McCain of Arizona, who also is counting on
Independents, is not campaigning here.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Republicans and Democrats, the voters who show up at
the caucus are not representative of the party membership. Among
Republicans, male voters are expected to significantly outnumber
women, even though more women are registered to vote in the GOP. A
disproportionate number of Democrats are likely to be union
members. Social conservatives who are fervently anti-abortion are
likely to once again vote in heavy numbers, throwing an air of
unpredictability into the GOP race.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of participation by Independents here is the opposite
of what is occurring in New Hampshire _ and that goes a long way
toward explaining the seesaw campaign results that often occur in
the two contests.
</P>
<P>
   Independents are the largest voting bloc in New Hampshire,
making up 37 percent of the electorate, and are likely to determine
the outcome of both races. But, with far less notice, Iowa
Independents this year also became the first-caucus state's largest
voting bloc, with 658,000 voters, compared with 582,000 Republicans
and 562,000 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Independents can switch their registration at any
time and vote in the caucus, there is relatively little courting of
the Independents here because the caucuses are so geared to party
activists.
</P>
<P>
   John and Doris Brock of Des Moines, who are both registered as
Independents, seem typical of that group. They said Friday they
hadn't decided whether to vote, partly because of the effort
required to switch their registration just before the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Brock said she doesn't feel excluded from the caucus, but
``it is just a matter of whether we want to expend the energy and
time to go, which is not a thing I'm proud of saying.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain often says he hasn't campaigned here because he was
willing to attack the tax break for the corn-based gasoline
additive ethanol. But that is not the only reason. While
agriculture and ethanol are important here, that is not nearly as
true as it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for McCain's decision to bypass this
state may be that he is opposed by most of the party establishment
and can't count on Independent voters here. Branstad said that
McCain ``missed an opportunity'' by not campaigning here and
seeking the Independent vote.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, all those Independents would seem to be a bright spot
for Bradley. But Bradley, who has poured the maximum $2.2 million
into this state, has had no choice but to spend most of his time
courting the party base. Bradley political director Pete
D'alessandro said in an interview that the former New Jersey
senator has made efforts to court Independents, but that it is
unrealistic to expect a large number to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caucus is so different from a primary,'' D'alessandro
said. ``For Independents, if you are going into a meeting of
Democrats, there is always going to be a moment before they walk
into the church basement when they say, `I'll vote for him in the
general election,' or `I don't want to stand up before my
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hoopla about the way Iowans pay more attention
to the presidential contest than people in most other states, the
voter turnout here is among the most dismal in the nation. In the
best case scenario, about 25 percent of voters in each party will
participate in the caucuses, far less than the more than 70 percent
expected to vote in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the people who do attend the caucuses are in many ways
not a representative demographic sample of Iowa, according to
surveys by the University of Northern Iowa, which has conducted
some of the most exhaustive research on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-year Republican organizational caucus of 1998, for
example, men outnumbered women by a two-to-one margin. In 1996, the
last presidential election year, men outnumbered women 54 percent
to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is expected to win the caucus, it is always possible
that one of the social conservatives in the race will run strongly,
as has happened in the past. That is because Republican caucus
goers are among the nation's strongest abortion opponents and
advocates of school prayer. Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are both
counting on that group for a strong showing, while Steve Forbes has
reengineered his flat tax-based campaign to win over social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, while more evenly balanced between men and women, are
a decidedly more liberal and unionized group than the general party
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa officials, who are used to attacks on the caucus system,
insist that it is a unique and useful way to narrow the
presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that do attend the Iowa caucus have now had the
opportunity to listen and talk to the candidates in some cases for
four years,'' Secretary of State Chet Culver said. ``They are
really experts. These are people that feel passionately about the
process and the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But that passion does not always translate into voting in the
caucus. Bejarno, asked why she came to hear Gore speak Friday but
doesn't plan to vote in the caucus on Monday night, said she
receives frequent calls from the Gore campaign ``telling us to be
sure to go to the caucus. I always tell them we aren't going to the
caucus, but will vote for him'' _ assuming Gore makes it to the
general election.

 &HT;    Special counsel requests tests on remains of slain Davidians
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The special counsel investigating FBI activities
on the final day of the Branch Davidian siege wants to perform his
own tests on the remains of sect members killed in the April 19,
1993, fire at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Special Counsel John Danforth asked U.S. District Judge Walter
S. Smith Jr. on Friday if his office can take temporary custody of
all tissue and bone samples of the human remains recovered after
the compound fire. The remains are being stored by the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Office of Special Counsel) needs the requested tissue and
bone samples in order to verify the toxicological work previously
performed and stated in the autopsy reports,'' Deputy Special
Counsel Edward L. Dowd Jr. wrote in a motion filed with Smith's
court in Waco. ``The OSC intends for its own independent expert
toxicologist to perform various tests on the requested evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in Danforth's St. Louis office declined to comment
on the request Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Kelly, a spokesman for the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology, said that his agency conducted DNA testing on the
charred remains to try to determine identification of victims after
the fire. However, while he confirmed that his agency is in custody
of remains, he said he is unsure how many victims' remains are left
there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said his agency will comply with requests from the court
or Danforth's office to make the samples available.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is presiding over the wrongful death lawsuit brought
by Branch Davidian survivors against the government, did not rule
on Danforth's request Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead plaintiffs' attorney in the civil lawsuit,
said that he also will be asking Smith for permission to perform
similar toxicological tests, adding that he hopes that he and the
Office of Special Counsel can cooperate to gain access to the
remains while they are available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth asked to maintain custody of the evidence for 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Danforth's investigators) are looking for several
things,'' Caddell said. ``I think they want to know who died from
gunshots, who died from smoke inhalation. One of the issues is if
you don't have any smoke in your body ... that means you were dead
when the fire started. That is kind of interesting in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also is interested in learning if there is evidence of
cyanide and signs that some Davidians were killed by gunfire that
was not at close range.
</P>
<P>
   Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers,
including 21 children, died in the fire at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have alleged that the FBI fired into the compound
as government military vehicles were pumping CS gas into the
crumbling structure. Cyanide is a component of CS gas, Caddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have denied that any of their agents fired
at Davidians on April 19, 1993, despite multiple rounds being fired
at agents and their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has set a May 15 trial date in the lawsuit.

GENEVA DEAL REACHED ON YOUNG SOLDIERS AFTER U.S. REVERSES STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Negotiators in Geneva agreed Friday on a new
international protocol prohibiting the use of child soldiers in war
after the United States dropped its opposition to establishing 18
as the minimum age for sending soldiers into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from the Pentagon,
had insisted for months that any agreement allow the United States
the option of sending volunteers as young as 17 into combat. The
administration's opposition had threatened to block efforts to
revise the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to
raise the minimum age for soldiers to 18 from 15.
</P>
<P>
   But in internal discussion during the last two weeks, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff dropped their opposition to a minimum of 18 and
accepted a compromise that would allow the armed services to
continue recruiting and training 17-year-olds as they do today, but
take ``all feasible measures'' to keep them out of combat until
they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. reversal cleared the way for negotiators from 50
countries to agree on new guidelines governing children in combat
after a final round of negotiations in Geneva. The protocol
agreement, which the U.N. General Assembly must approve before
governments can begin to ratify it, would also prohibit the
drafting of children younger than 18 and would require countries to
raise the minimum age for volunteers above 15, the convention's
current standard.
</P>
<P>
   As with many treaties, the countries that agree to those
international standards on child soldiers are expected to be the
ones least likely to violate them. Some of the most egregious
violators may not sign, while others may sign and simply ignore the
provisions, given that the protocol provides no real enforcement to
punish violators.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and other supporters of the
protocol agreement said Friday that it would help to stigmatize the
use of children in combat, especially since the Convention on the
Rights of the Child has strong international support. Only the
United States and Somalia have yet to ratify overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. compromise amounts to a tactical retreat by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who had feared that a strict age limit would
prohibit recruiters from signing up 17-year-olds, who today can
join the military with parental consent. The Pentagon won the right
to continue that practice but agreed to take still-unspecified
steps to keep those youngest soldiers and sailors out of direct
warfare, administration and defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiefs weren't crazy about it,'' a defense official in
Washington said, ``but we felt we could live with it with that kind
of construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new minimum will have little real effect on the U.S.
military, which has nearly 1.4 million men and women in uniform.
Last year, 49,900 enlistees were 17 when they signed up to join the
armed services, but only 11,000 were still 17 when they reported to
basic training. Of those, only 2,500 had not turned 18 by the time
training was completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's retreat saved the administration the
diplomatic embarrassment of blocking an agreement meant to prohibit
the use of soldiers as young as 9 or 10 in some of the world's most
brutal conflicts, a policy that officials at the State Department
strongly advocated. Experts have estimated that as many as 300,000
children are fighting in wars from Africa to Chechnya to Latin
America, many of them drafted against their will.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked as if the negotiations would end like
those on an international treaty to ban land mines. In that case,
the Pentagon's opposition to a broad ban kept the administration
from signing the treaty, despite support from the State Department
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protocol is an important advance for human rights,'' the
president said in a statement released by the White House on
Friday. ``At the same time, it fully protects the military
recruitment and readiness requirements of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in
1995, but has yet to submit it for ratification by the Senate,
where it faces opposition from conservatives who argue that it
usurps the rights of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the administration signs the protocol, it will also require
Senate approval. Because of opposition to the convention overall,
the administration may well submit only the new protocol for
ratification, increasing the chances that the Senate would ratify
it. But any move to ratify is not expected to take place until the
end of the year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol also applies its standards to rebel groups or other
factions that are not represented by any government and so not
party to it. Still, proponents said they hoped that the desire for
international recognition by some of those groups would curb the
most extreme cases of putting children into combat.

</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the minimum age for soldiers dragged on for six
years, reflecting the complexities of countries' policies on young
soldiers. Britain, for example, begins recruiting at 16, though it
does not deploy the recruits in units until they are older.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol requires any country accepting volunteers under 18
to maintain safeguards to ensure that they are not coerced into
signing up and that they have parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries still have compulsory service, often beginning
before young men turn 18. The last round of negotiations almost
collapsed Friday when Cuba protested the language, hoping to be
able to continue to draft soldiers at 17. But in the end the Cuban
negotiators accepted the minimum of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Becker, an official with Human Rights Watch, welcomed the
agreement, though she expressed disappointment that the United
States and other countries succeeded in weakening a strict minimum
age of 18 for anyone in uniform, which Canada and the Scandinavian
countries had advocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard does allow a little wiggle room for exceptional
cases,'' she said. ``We would have liked stronger language, but
this is a good step.''
</P>
<P>
   The weakest part of the new agreement, she and others said, was
language requiring governments to raise the minimum age for
voluntary recruitment, which today is 15. The protocol calls on
them to increase it, but does not specify by how much, though some
officials interpret that to mean raising it to at least 16. The
language was left vague, a Clinton administration official said,
mainly because the negotiators could not have otherwise come to a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Although willing to compromise on establishing a minimum age for
combat duty, Pentagon officials insisted that it not be an absolute
ban. Although there are very few 17-year-olds in combat units,
Pentagon officials said they envisioned a situation when one
assigned to a peacekeeping operation or aboard a ship could end up
in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If commanders get caught in exceptional circumstance,'' one
official said, ``it would not be a violation to have a soldier in
direct combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The protocol requires countries to take ``all feasible
measures'' to keep soldiers under 18 out of combat, but that is
language open to interpretation. An administration official said
the Pentagon would ultimately establish its own rules for the armed
services to determine the extent to which commanders will be
required to keep the youngest U.S. soldiers away from battlefields.

TRADE DEFICIT PITS U.S. AGAINST OTHER G7 MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also IMF-GERMANY)

<P>
   TOKYO _ Against the backdrop of the record $26.5 billion U.S.
trade deficit, the meeting of the finance ministers and central
bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that will take
place here Saturday has shaped up as a conflict between the United
States and the rest of the members.
</P>
<P>
   During a press briefing Friday evening, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers repeatedly if diplomatically suggested that
Japan and Europe were not pulling their weight in the global
economy. ``You can't have a balanced global economy without more
growth in Europe and Japan,'' he said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Summers sought to portray the huge trade deficit as an
endorsement of the U.S. economy, saying it was a demonstration of
the financial strength of American companies and consumers as well
as a result of capital inflows from abroad drawn to attractive
American investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in Asia and to a lesser extent in Europe has pulled
out of the economic doldrums through exports to the United States,
running up huge current account surpluses in the process. Summers
called for a reversal of that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to happen, it is important that all regions pursue
appropriate economic policies, both in the macro-economy and
structurally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion is rising among U.S. officials that their European
counterparts are deliberately turning a blind eye to the weakness
of the euro, which makes European exports to the United States
cheaper, rather than adopting more politically difficult policies
like altering social welfare benefits and labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have the opposite problem: The yen is strong, at
least in part because of the U.S. trade deficit. They are thus
pushing the officials at the meeting to issue a statement of at
least mild concern about the current relationship between the
world's three dominant currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, on the other hand, do not want to see the phrase
``exchange rates'' mentioned at all in the final communique that
will be issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And neither Europe, where the economy is thriving, nor Japan,
which is slowly crawling out of a recession, has much sympathy for
the United States, with its strong dollar, booming stock market,
low unemployment and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury secretary also met Friday with Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi of Japan and commended him on Japan's nascent economic
recovery, although he reiterated long-standing demands that Japan
do more to foster domestic consumption and structural changes.

UBIQUITOUS TOMMY: DID HE GROW TOO FAST AND LOSE HIS COOL?

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Tommy still hip-hop and all that?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Tommy Hilfiger Corp. was a fashion house fairy
tale. By aggressively pitching itself as the clothier of rebellious
rappers and their acolytes, the designer rode the crossover
cultural wave to become a $1.6 billion megabrand in less than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, his enduring chemistry with music celebrities
was on display at the American Music Awards where he dressed hot
acts like Ginuwine, 98 Degrees and Lou Bega, who mamboed the
evening away in camel suede Hilfiger trousers.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is dancing to the designer's beat. Last week,
the company announced that faltering consumer demand at the end of
1999 could result in the company's first quarter without any profit
growth since going public in 1992. The news sent the stock plunging
to a 52-week low and started industry insiders whispering about the
impossible: that the impresario of street fashion was losing his
magic marketing touch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fashion is a cyclical business, and every designer
has ups and downs. Hilfiger's management is quick to point out that
its name is still rated cool in numerous teen brand surveys and
that sales continue to grow as the designer hawks an ever-widening
array of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously feel the brand is very strong,'' Hilfiger said in
an interview Friday night. ``We did more business this year than
last year. We continue to see growth and we are always evolving the
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand may be strong, but it is definitely slowing. Profits
for the quarter ended Dec. 31, scheduled to be announced on Feb. 2,
are now expected to be 58 cents to 64 cents a share, well below
Wall Street's earlier expectations of 73 cents and perhaps below
the 61 cents of a year earlier. The company now says that earnings
for the current quarter will also probably come in below the 48
cents a share of the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year that ends in March, Tommy's profits are
expected to be 8 percent higher than the previous year, according
to First Call/Thomsom Financial, which tracks corporate earnings.
While healthy, that would be a striking lull for Hilfiger, whose
average annual increase in sales and profits has been nearly 50
percent for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling is the company's admission that it is
disappointed with results not only in the men's sportswear
division, which is 10 years old, but in the women's line, which was
introduced only in 1998 and was supposed to propel revenue
expansion for years to come. Hilfiger said the disappointing
results were part of an ``adjustment period'' and now the company
was moving to more clearly differentiate its men's, women's and
children's clothing lines in the customers' minds. He added that he
still felt the brand was ``just beginning to tap the potential of
women's wear.''
</P>
<P>
   With perfect 20-20 hindsight, industry analysts, say the brand
is suffering from uncontrolled growth. ``Tommy has Nike-itis,''
said Martyn Straw, president of the Interbrand Corp., a global
brand consulting firm based in New York. ``They are just too
ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly in the last two years, Hilfiger has slapped its name
on products as disparate as bicycles, sunglasses, towels and
bedding products. Still to come in 2000: jewelry, watches and
intimate apparel. And like Godzilla marching through Tokyo,
Hilfiger has been munching up department store space at a rapacious
pace, leaving even the brand's most ardent supporter wondering
whether it is too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are not embarrassed to be seen wearing the clothes,''
said Faye Landes, who is a stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners and still rates Hilfiger's stock a buy. ``But they have
hit a wall because enough stuff is enough stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The department store deluge has come just as the All-American
college look segment is getting very crowded. Specialty retailers
like Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters have also
been on fire with the very lucrative suburban teen-age shopper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kenneth Cole and the Gap's Banana Republic are
suddenly giving Hilfiger a run in dress clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of current sales, there is the issue of future
growth, and that depends on something intangible. The mavens of
cool say that Hilfiger's turn to selling merchandise everywhere has
hurt the brand with trend-setting teen-agers, a notoriously fickle
but crucial crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the urban community are switching to brands they see
as more real, like Fubu,'' said Irma Zandl, president of Zandl
Group, which tracks trends among the under-30 set.  &QL;
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hilfiger maintains street credibility, its resonance
with suburban kids may be starting to wane, but for a different
reason: namely, Tommy is too closely linked with rap. Over the
years, Hilfiger has positioned himself as a multicultural version
of Ralph Lauren, accessible to all races and economic groups, by
dressing notorious celebrities like Snoop Doggy Dogg. But that once
lucrative link may now be backfiring as the the music loses its
hold over the youngest people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend for casual wear and hip-hop wear with which Tommy is
so associated has peaked,'' argues David Wolfe, creative director
of the Doneger Group, a retail consulting firm. ``They have defined
that look, and now it is passing their prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's managers say their marketing remains right and say
they have no plans for big change. ``I do not think hip-hop is in
any way past its prime,'' protests Peter Connoly, president of
worldwide marketing. He adds that Hilfiger has reached out to a
wide variety of market segments. In the last year, for example, the
brand has used images of music stars as diverse as the iconic
Rolling Stones to the budding bubble-gum pop diva Britney Spears to
define a broader image.
</P>
<P>
   But Hilfiger's shift may be too subtle for a brand that has lost
some of its steam, some marketers say. ``They are doing a lot of
mainstream events, and they have been perceived as mainstream,''
warns David Redhill, executive director of global communications,
for Landor Associates, branding consultants with offices in San
Francisco. ``They need to own the mind space of being hip and on
the edge. They need to do something radical.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising has presented a consistent theme, perhaps too
consistent, argues J'Amy Owens, president of the Retail Group in
Seattle. ``They are not taking enough risks with the advertising,''
Ms. Owens says. ``Ralph takes on these fantasy vacations: one year
to India and the next to Africa. Then you turn around and are on
his ranch buying blankets. With Tommy we've seen the beautiful kids
in a green field on a farm too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hilfiger is going to give investors the double-digit growth
they have come to expect _ and management has said it is committed
to doing just that _ analysts say it may have to buy another brand
and expand it, in much the same way that Liz Claiborne is nurturing
Kenneth Cole and Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. has taken over Club
Monaco. It is no secret that Hilfiger has been among a small group
of companies looking over the books at Calvin Klein Inc., which is
up for sale. Hilfiger says that he would consider such an option,
but that there is still plenty of room to grow his own namesake
label, which leaves the question of how to reignite the brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Retail Group's Ms. Owens argues that Hilfiger needs a wild
makeover to be hot again. ``Retreat and let people forget for a
moment,'' suggests Ms. Owens, ``and then pull a Madonna. Since we
know Tommy as a tall All-American blonde, they should come out as a
short brunette.'' &QL;

   If History Is Any Guide, The Party May Continue &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the millennium sizzled, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index up 14.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 1999. So
it is fair to assume some investors expect a pullback in the market
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. A recent S&AMP;P study shows that strong
fourth-quarter gains are likely to be followed by outsized
first-quarter gains in the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the Jan. 19 issue of The Outlook, an S&AMP;P
newsletter, focused on fourth-quarter returns from 1935 through
1998. It noted that the S&AMP;P 500 had gained 10 percent or more on
only eight occasions. In these eight instances, the average
first-quarter gain for the following year was 8 percent, four times
the average first-quarter gain of just 2 percent for the entire
65-year study.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the following year's outperformance continued into the
second quarter. In the years following those outsized
fourth-quarter returns, second-quarter S&AMP;P 500 returns averaged 6.2
percent, compared with 2.4 percent over the entire 1935 through
1999 period.
</P>
<P>
   Given the outperformance in the first two quarters following
double-digit fourth-quarter gains, it is not surprising that full
year returns were also well above average in the following year. On
average the S&AMP;P 500 gained 19.1 percent in those eight years,
compared with 9.5 percent over the entire 1935 through 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the S&AMP;P 500 was down 1.9 percent year to date
through Friday.

`TOUGH' JOB IS SEEN IN U.N. TO CUT U.S. DUES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. representative to the United Nations,
Richard Holbrooke, said on Friday that ``it's going to be tough''
to win consent from the organization to reduce Washington's share
of the United Nations' regular budget, a major condition Congress
has dictated in exchange for paying nearly $1 billion in American
debt to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke, addressing a field hearing of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee in Manhattan, expressed confidence that the
United Nations would eventually cut the U.S. share to at least 22
percent, and perhaps to 20 percent, from 25 percent, as required by
legislation enacted last year that ended a three-year stalemate
over Washington's back dues.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, the American strategy has imitators. The
legislature in Japan, which pays 19 percent of the United Nations'
regular budget, has taken up a bill similar to the one Congress
passed, Holbrooke said, foreshadowing a contentious debate over
what would be the first reassessment since 1973 of the annual dues
that member nations pay the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most difficult of the changes,'' Holbrooke said,
referring to a series of structural reforms in the bill that aim to
tighten oversight and eliminate waste in the organization. The
legislation also calls for reducing the United States' share of the
United Nations' peacekeeping budget to 25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hearing, held in the ornate Great Hall of the Bar
Association of New York, capped a two-day visit to New York by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the committee, and several of his
Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Security Council on Thursday, Helms
delivered a bleak portrayal of the United Nations, and council
delegates shot back with sharp but diplomatic rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, by contrast, was a day for Holbrooke, who arranged
Helms' visit during the month he is the Security Council's
president, to ease any tension by proclaiming the extraordinary
council gathering and Friday's hearing as the beginning of a new
chapter in relations between the United States and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Holbrooke, who spent weeks last year courting
Congress to break the impasse over back dues, told the senators
what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sum up the U.N. in three words: flawed but indispensable,''
Holbrooke said. ``The United Nations can be vastly improved, and
that's what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the area of peacekeeping, Holbrooke said U.N. missions in
Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia had lacked clearly defined mandates and
had failed. Now the United Nations was embarking on a new set of
challenges in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Kosovo, where success is
crucial. ``The U.N. will not get a third chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations should marshal peacekeeping missions on a
``case by case'' basis, and he gently warned that Congress would
soon be notified for a new assessment for such an operation in
Sierra Leone. While criticizing the organization for bureaucratic
inefficiencies, Holbrooke showed his diplomatic stripes by not
singling out any individual or country for blame. On the contrary,
he went to great lengths to praise repeatedly the U.N. delegates
from Britain, Australia, Mexico and several other countries who sat
in the audience Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said this was testament to the new spirit of
cooperation with Helms, one of the United Nations' most persistent
and vociferous critics. But clearly Holbrooke will need all the
help he can muster to gain approval for the ``benchmark reforms''
contained in the American legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Holbrooke said the United States' leverage for
achieving structural changes had improved markedly now that
Congress had agreed to pay $819 million in back dues, and to
forgive $107 million in debt. ``People who weren't willing to
discuss benchmarks before, now are willing,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there were moments when Holbrooke defended the United
Nations. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services
Committee and was invited to attend Friday's hearing, said that he
had just returned from a visit to the Balkans, and that the United
Nations was on ``the brink of failure'' in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said that crime was rampant in Bosnia, that the
international police were lacking in Kosovo, and that there was not
even enough electricity to power the lamps in the allied
headquarters in Pristina, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he agreed with that assessment, but then noted
that the United Nations was not responsible for all. The European
Union is responsible for generating power; NATO is responsible for
security. ``It's not just the U.N.,'' he said. ``It's the whole
system.''

SHAKY CONCERNS ARE THE TALK OF CHAT ROOMS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investing chat rooms are great gauges of what is hot
among today's fickle and fidgety stock traders. The chat room craze
du jour is stocks of companies that are currently insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, investors have thronged into shares of troubled
companies like Fruit of the Loom, Levitz Furniture, Loehmann's,
Iridium World Communications and the Singer Co. Between Jan. 10 and
Jan. 12, for example, Levitz Furniture shares went from 5 cents to
37 cents on no news. And last Wednesday, Loehmann's stock almost
tripled for no apparent reason, going from 12 cents a share to 34
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to pay their debts, most of these companies are trying to
restructure their borrowings and get back on track through the
bankruptcy court process known as Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, the chatterers seem to view these companies'
depressed shares as bets worth taking. One Fruit of the Loom fan
posted this message on a Yahoo board last week: ``FTL's earnings
were upgraded by First Call to less of a loss, this makes me
believe that we have nowhere to go but up from here.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to investors who specialize in distressed
companies, the odds of a common stockholder ending up with anything
of value once a reorganization is complete are close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owning the common stock is absolutely ridiculous for economic
reasons,'' said Martin J. Whitman, chief executive of Third Avenue
Trust, a mutual fund concern, and a veteran investor in distressed
companies. ``If I wanted to control the bankruptcy process, I might
want to buy up the common. But what does that have to do with the
chat room people?''
</P>
<P>
   In a typical revamping, stockholders wind up with nothing. Only
the creditors _ the banks, bondholders, preferred stockholders and
so on _ get anything back.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet chat reveals that some of the investors buying into
these companies know little about the reorganization process. A
message posted on Yahoo's Fruit of the Loom board said: ``A company
has value until they tell the public there's no value.'' Another
stated flatly that a bankruptcy judge could wipe out a company's
debt and leave the equity alone, a ruling that would be as likely
as a snowball surviving Dante's Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Fruit of the Loom, the eighth-largest company to file
for bankruptcy last year, were among the most active on the New
York Stock Exchange last Thursday. The stock closed Friday at
$2.375, up more than 150 percent since Dec. 30, when the company
filed for Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, said Gordon McCormick, managing director at M.J.
Whitman Inc. He points out that the prices at which a distressed
company's bonds trade reveals what chances a stockholder has of
recovering anything in a reorganization. ``If bonds are in the
mid-50s, maybe stockholders get a tip to go along, like 25 cents,''
he said. ``When there are bonds under 10, the stock gets zero.''
Fruit of the Loom's most junior bonds recently traded between 7 and
9 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick suspects some investors have migrated from formerly
hot Internet shares into distressed stocks. ``The people that were
buying eToys, E-Loan, theglobe.com, they need a new game,'' he
said. Distressed stocks ``are very thin, information is scarce and
the people that own them have memories of very high prices when the
company was healthy. It is the perfect place for cynical
manipulators to play.''

   MIAMI _ As news spread that Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers were
in the United States holding a news conference, the question that
ricocheted among the boy's Florida relatives and their supporters
was this: Why did the women go to New York to visit politicians and
not to Miami to visit their 6-year-old grandson?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the grandmothers are really concerned about the
boy, they should come to Miami where the family here has told them
not only are they welcome, but we'll roast a pig for them,'' said
Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives, who are
suing the government to block the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should see where he sleeps, where he plays, where he goes
to school and see the love and affection he gets at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers, moving from tearful to angry as they
talked to reporters Friday, made clear that they would not visit
Miami, which they said was populated by the Cuban exile ``mafia.''
And Elian's Miami relatives, including his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who has temporary custody of the boy, said they had no
plans to take Elian to New York to see the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come, see the boy and be with the boy,'' Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his lawyers reiterated that the courts must decide
whether Elian stays here or is turned over to his grandmothers.
``That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this
country can resolve this problem,'' said Delfin Gonzalez, another
of Elian's great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
   Some Miamians saw the grandmothers' visit as orchestrated by the
Clinton administration and the Cuban government to build support
for the boy's return to Cuba. And Spencer Eig, another family
lawyer, said the grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela
Quintana, clearly showed that they had been manipulated by the
Cuban government, which he said had turned them against their Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lost his mother after the boat on which they were fleeing
Cuba for Miami capsized. His father wants the boy sent back to him
and immigration officials have ordered him returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they know about the situation is what the Cuban government
has told them over the last two months,'' Eig said. ``I'm sure the
Cuban government has filled them with propaganda and vitriol
against the Gonzalez family.''
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than react angrily at the grandmothers' sometimes
harsh words, many in the exile community did the opposite Friday.
In a gesture meant to show Cuba's president, Fidel Castro, that
they were not hostile ``kidnappers,'' many Cuban-Americans urged
the grandmothers to visit Miami, and one community leader offered
to pay for their trip.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a help for the grandmothers to see that Elian is
content and well-adjusted, said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers
to the Rescue, a prominent exile group. ``We are not what people
have painted us to be in Cuba,'' Basulto said. ``I will offer them
my house, my protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives and their lawyers were quick to contradict
the grandmothers' assertions that the boy had told them repeatedly
on the telephone that he wanted to return to Cuba. Delfin Gonzalez,
the great-uncle, said that just Friday Elian had repeated his wish
to stay in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to go,'' Gonzalez said. ``Nobody here has told
him anything or pressured him at all. He himself says he doesn't
want to go.''

FOR ALLENDE'S DAUGHTER, A BRIGHT MOMENT OF RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ When Congresswoman Isabel Allende, the
youngest daughter of the late President Salvador Allende Gossens,
turned 55 on Tuesday, she celebrated by going dancing at a
discotheque.
</P>
<P>
   But for her, the night on the town had more to do with ``this
bright wonderful moment of opportunity for Chile,'' rather than
celebrating the beginning of one more year of her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricardo Lagos' election was the best birthday present I could
possibly have received,'' she said of the election results on
Sunday that bring the first Socialist to power since her father was
killed in a bloody military coup in 1973. ``We have come full
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the small living room of the modest house where she
grew up, one that is decorated with photographs of her parents and
prints and pottery that Allende brought home from his trips, Ms.
Allende expressed sublime optimism and vindication. She said all
those positive feelings bubbling inside were in no way subdued by
another historic event that could occur any day: the return of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet after his 15 months under house arrest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw is expected in a few days to end an
extradition process that would have sent Pinochet to stand trial
for human rights violations in Spain. Straw announced this month
that a team of doctors had found that the former dictator was too
ill to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Allende sees it, Pinochet's long absence freed Chile from
many of its unresolved conflicts of the past. With the former
dictator gone, she noted, 56 retired military and police officials,
including five generals, have been arrested for human rights
violations in the past year, and right-wing politicians have begun
to distance themselves from the man whom they used to praise and
salute.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that the reaction to Pinochet's return would be
subdued and that in several months Chileans would finally have the
possibility to demand that the general face justice here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He returns alone, humbled, morally condemned and to a country
that has changed, one in which even the presidential candidate of
the right said he could be tried here,'' Ms. Allende said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added a cautionary note, saying, ``If he doesn't face
justice, it will show we do not yet have a full democracy in Chile,
and the transition is still incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, physical illness does not exempt a defendant from
standing trial, although insanity or dementia does.
</P>
<P>
   A decorous woman with an easy smile and a taste for simple
clothes and pearl earrings, Ms. Allende repeatedly referred to
Pinochet as ``he'' rather than have to say his name. But when she
talks about her father, her eyes brighten and she says with pride,
``When I was a girl, people always said I looked like him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Allende, this bright moment of renewal has been a long
time coming. She recalled seeing her father for the last time, as
tanks began moving against the government and Allende foresaw the
coming air force bombardment of the presidential palace, La Moneda.
Her father had to plead three times with her and her sister
Beatriz, who was 7 months pregnant, before they agreed to leave him
where he would die in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the danger, but we didn't want to abandon the ship,''
Ms. Allende recounted. ``But he was right. He wanted us to survive
to be witnesses, to denounce and to continue the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of her exile years in Mexico, and they were not
easy years. One aunt, stricken with cancer, committed suicide in
Cuba after Pinochet would not let her return to Chile to die. And
her sister also committed suicide in Cuba, after a deep depression.
</P>
<P>
   But Isabel Allende and her mother, Hortensia Bussi de Allende,
now 85, returned to Chile in 1988, a few months before Chileans
voted in a plebiscite to deny Pinochet eight additional years in
power. Today, Ms. Allende is an influential congresswoman, and she
is one of 21 members on the Socialist Party Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, as it became clear that Lagos would win, Ms.
Allende went to Constitution Plaza in front of La Moneda to
celebrate with thousands of Socialist and Christian Democratic
followers who supported Lagos' campaign. She said she felt a
special gratitude to Lagos, because he opened his victory speech
with an acknowledgment to her mother as ``Chile's example of
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the people dancing in their happiness,'' she said,
``it reminded me of Sept. 4, 1970, the night of Salvador Allende's
victory. Many people came up to me and said of my father: `He's
with us now. He helped us win.' That's a popular kind of sentiment,
and for me it was very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other Socialist Party leaders, she acknowledged that
Lagos' government would look quite different from her father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical context is totally different from that of 1970,
when we lived in a bipolar world in the middle of the Cold War,''
Ms. Allende said. ``My father was in a coalition with the Communist
Party, and the Christian Democratic Party was strongly against us.
Now we are in a different coalition, one that includes the
Christian Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Lagos would make a point of increasing opportunities
for the poor, as her father tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families in this country that have four children, but
they can only afford to send one to college,'' she added. ``That
should not be.''

 STATES CUT DEATH TAX TO KEEP RICH AT HOME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the nation, state legislatures have revised laws on gift
and estate taxes, bringing them in line with federal law, and
cheering lawyers who have seen an exodus of affluent older clients
from traditionally high-tax states like New York to traditionally
low-tax states like Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is no reason to move to Florida to avoid transfer
taxes,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger, partner and head of the wills
and estate department of the New York law firm Kaye, Scholer,
Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, which is a complicated one, works like this: At the
federal level there is a unified tax credit for gifts and estates
totaling $675,000 this year. That means that gifts and estates up
to that level are not taxed. Above that level, gifts and estates
are taxed at rates of 37 percent to 55 percent, depending on their
size.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many states levy their own gift and estate taxes.
But state estate taxes of up to 16 percent can also be claimed as a
credit on federal returns _ and reduce the federal taxes dollar for
dollar. What this means to the estate is that the combined federal
and state taxes are no greater than the federal tax would have been
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Because states are able to levy a 16 percent estate tax at no
additional cost to their taxpayers, the tax has become known as a
``sop up'' or ``sponge'' tax, since it just sops up the federal
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nevada, which has no income tax and previously had no
estate tax, thereby attracting many retirees from neighboring
California, has enacted a sop-up tax, Schlesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   New York had a graduated gift and estate tax that went as high
as 21 percent, costing the estates of affluent residents an extra 5
percent beyond the federal taxes. But New York has repealed its
gift tax, effective Jan. 1, and changed its estate tax law,
effective Feb. 1, making both the rates and the ceilings conform to
federal law _ creating a sop-up tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very salutary change for New York,'' said Jonathan
Herlands, partner in charge of the trusts and estate department of
the New York law firm Janvey, Gordon, Herlands, Randolph, Rosenberg
&AMP; Cox. ``It has put New York and Florida on a level playing
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Jan. 31 in New York, the ceiling at which estates become
taxable is $300,000. The estates of a husband and wife totaling
$1.3 million would be free of federal taxes, but could owe $57,000
in state taxes, Schlesinger said. ``People did move to Florida on
the concept this was a tax they could avoid easily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger called New York ``the last guest at the wedding'' in
changing its estate-tax law to conform to the federal law, joining
35 other states with sop-up taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states, including Connecticut, still have estate taxes
that exceed the federal tax credit, imposing extra costs on their
residents. And four states _ Connecticut, Tennessee, North Carolina
and Louisiana _ and Puerto Rico still levy gift taxes, for which
there is no federal tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Herlands predicted these states, too, would soon make their laws
conform. New York saw a ``hemorrhaging of wealth,'' as affluent
people left the state to minimize the tax burden on their heirs, he
said. ``Now they are not running in droves to Florida,'' he
continued, and their contributions to the New York economy and the
income taxes they pay should more than offset the estate and gift
taxes the state is forgoing.
</P>
<P>
   Will people who have already moved to Florida return?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once they get down there, they are seduced by the
weather,'' Herlands replied.

BELICHICK WORTH A FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the New York Jets paid the Patriots four
draft choices to acquire Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, Joe
Gibbs was asked if Parcells was worth it. The gist of Gibbs's
answer: ``Are you kidding me? All the draft choices in the world
aren't worth one good football coach. We never had any draft
choices in Washington (where he won three Super Bowls) and we won.
There are other ways to get players, beside draft choices.''
</P>
<P>
   This humble servant agrees with Gibbs. If Bill Belichick isn't
worth giving up the first-round pick in the draft (16th overall),
the Patriots should have never gone after him.
</P>
<P>
   A person you think should be the coach and general manager and
run the franchise for the next five years isn't worth the 16th pick
in the draft? Anyone who has studied the recent NFL drafts should
know that there are never more than 10 ``blue chippers'' _ guys
that can't miss _ in any draft.
</P>
<P>
   After that group goes off the board, you can throw a bag over
the next 30 or 40 players. They are all the same. Where they are
taken depends on a team's preference. Logic seems to dictate that a
team could take the money it saves not paying a first-round choice
and use it to sign a proven player in free agency, or use it to
keep one of your own players. Question: Would you rather use that
money and keep a Troy Brown or a Tedy Bruschi, both proven veteran
players, or keep the pick and get Chris Canty? The answer is not
hard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots seemed to be preparing for Plan B even before
commissioner Paul Tagliabue handed down his ruling on Belichick
Friday. Team owner Bob Kraft had two recent conversations with Tom
Donahoe, now the hottest item on the NFL's front office market.
Donahoe, who was forced to resign in Pittsburgh, is being romanced
by New Orleans and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, he has been offered the total package in New Orleans
to be GM and run the franchise. He was in Miami Friday meeting with
the Dolphins. New Miami coach Dave Wannstedt, an old friend of
Donahoe's, would like him to run the front office. If Donahoe takes
over in New Orleans, he is expected to bring Jacksonville defensive
coordinator Dom Capers with him as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When word comes down from the mount from someone of George
Seifert's stature, you pay attention. Seifert has competed against
the best offensive units in the NFL for the past 20 years. He has
three Super Bowl rings as the defensive coordinator of the San
Francisco 49ers, and two more as head coach. For many years he
coached Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger Craig &AMP; Co., and thought he
had seen the best. Now he has changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 St. Louis Rams have his vote as the best offensive team
he has ever seen. ``They are very fast,'' said the Carolina coach,
who has faced the Rams twice this season. ``Very explosive. Very
well coached. Have excellent talent. A great scheme, but more than
anything else, an uncanny knack of finding and exploiting the
weaknesses of opposing defenses. When you try to stop the Rams'
offense, there is nothing you can hang your hat on the way to try
to stop them. Their (offensive) coaches have a wonderful sense of
timing. They do a wonderful job of calling plays.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, heading into the NFL's Final Four weekend, is the
heavy favorite among the league's coaches to win it all this year.
Here is some analysis from two coaches on this weekend's games.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, New York Jets, on the Jacksonville-Tennessee AFC
Championship Game:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the game in Jacksonville, Tennessee has a big
pyschological advantage. They know they can beat Jacksonville.
They've beaten them three in a row going back to last year and have
beaten them the last two times they played in Jacksonville. So they
know they can win. Jacksonville doesn't know that. Believe me, it's
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against Tennessee last year and they've improved
since then. Offense is about the same, but the defense is better
with this kid (Jevon) Kearse. (Coach) Jeff Fisher is a Buddy Ryan
guy and they play defense like a Buddy Ryan defense.
One-dimensional. They live or die with pressure (going after the
passer). Everyone says how great they played on defense to beat
Indianapolis last week. They played good, but not great. Played
good enough to win, but don't forget, the Colts dropped three
passes in that game that would have been for big gains, and any one
of them could have turned the game in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think Jacksonville's offensive line is better than
Tennessee's. I think the opposite. I like Tennessee's better and
this big kid they have at right tackle, (Jon) Runyan, is the best
right tackle in football. He's a load. Eddie George is a terrific
runner. He reminds me a lot of O.J. Anderson. Great cuts. Gets
upfield. I'm not a big fan of their passing game. They run the ball
and do it well. Jacksonville is going to have to shut down the run
if they want to win. With George going against (Fred) Taylor,
you've got the stallion vs. the game-breaker. George will eat up
yardage. Taylor can take it all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jacksonville has the edge at quarterback, wide
receiver, and in the passing game. I think Kevin Hardy of
Jacksonville is the best linebacker on the field. The kid to watch
on Tennessee is the strong safety, Blaine Bishop. He's one of the
best in football. They build their defense around him moving up
close to the line and being a force in stopping the running game.
These two teams are very close. One or two plays will probably turn
this game. This isn't going to be like Miami, when they just
self-destructed last week. (Al) Del Greco for Tennessee is a great
pressure kicker, which is a big factor when you have a close game.
Mistakes should determine who wins this one. If Jacksonville has a
way to beat Tennessee's defensive pressure, then they should win.
If they don't, then they'll probably get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Billick, Baltimore Ravens, on the St. Louis-Tampa Bay NFC
Championship Game:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the offensive coordinator in Minnesota before coming to
Baltimore, so we matched up twice every year with Tampa Bay, and we
played St. Louis to open our (1999) season here. I have the
greatest respect for Tony Dungy and their team, but I think this
could be a long day for them. St. Louis can strike at any moment.
They can score on offense, defense, and special teams. They can be
down, 14 points, 21 points, and it doesn't bother them. They feel
they can come back and win because of their offensive firepower.
Marshall Faulk of the Rams is the key guy in the game. He is the
guy that can really hurt the Tampa Bay defense, that I think is as
good as any in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay has great speed on defense but St. Louis can match
it on offense. And the way they move around on offense, the Rams
will make the Tampa defense move to where they want it, and then
attack it in the soft spots. I look for St. Louis to stretch that
Tampa defense (by offensive formation) and then start to attack the
weaknesses. Shaun King did enough to beat Washington last week, but
this isn't Washington, and the game is not in Tampa. This is not
going to be a 14-13 game. You have a rookie quarterback, going into
the biggest game of his life, against a very noisy and hostile
crowd, playing against a terrific team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tampa Bay gets down a couple of touchdowns early, this
could turn ugly. Tampa Bay wants to run the ball, and control the
clock. They don't want to throw. But if they're forced to throw to
get back into the game, it could be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, on how his staff shapes up
heading into training camp: ``We went through 23 pitchers last year
and when I talked to Jimy (Williams) up in Boston last week, I told
him the same thing might happen this season. We are lucky that we
have a lot of pitching depth in this organization at the Triple A
level that can help us through some tough spots. Our plan is to get
a legitimate look at eight or 10 guys in spring training as
legitimate starters. We have Pedro (Martinez), Ramon (Martinez),
(Tim) Wakefield, (Brian) Rose, (Bryce) Florie, (Juan) Pena, (Tomo)
Ohka, (Jin Ho) Cho. We're hoping one or two of the younger guys can
step up and become starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bret) Saberhagen is anywhere from May to July. We can't say
for sure when he'll be back, but he phoned me earlier this week and
said he has already started to throw. So that's encouraging. We
plan to have (Derek) Lowe as a closer. He was coming on strong all
of last year. He seems to be moving up the ladder, step by step.
Our feeling is that it's better to get something from him in 70
games out of the bullpen than 30 games as a starter. He continues
to improve every season, and he improved a lot during last season.
He was way ahead at the end from where he was at the start of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox tickets went on sale last Saturday, they had
the single-biggest selling day in their history. They sold more
than 50,000 tickets, 10,000 more than their previous record, set in
1989, which is a solid indication they will sell more tickets
before the start of this season than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Red Sox gave unprecedented contracts to Carlton
Fisk, Fred Lynn, and Rick Burleson, just as the free agency era in
baseball was beginning. In 1967, after his marvelous Cy Young Award
season, Jim Lonborg tore his knee apart in a skiing accident and
was never the same pitcher. With that in mind, the Sox wanted to
insert all kinds of clauses into the contracts of the '76 trio,
preventing them from skiing, skydiving, mountain climbing, etc.
Fisk had the only exception written into his. He was allowed to
chop wood . . . Former Celtics coach M.L. Carr nominates himself as
the next coach and GM of the Patriots. ``I've proven I can win 15
games in a season, and still get a team a couple of high draft
choices. Who else can say that? Fifteen wins gets you in the Super
Bowl.'' . . . Boston sports fans were marveling at the toughness of
Ray Bourque, returning to practice the next day after he had three
teeth knocked out and took 11 stitches in the lip the day before.
What they don't know is that Bourque wanted to return to the game
as soon as Dr. Bert Zarins stitched him up, and Zarins restrained
him from doing so.

   A Raider Follows A Champagne Dream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asher Edelman, the American corporate raider who turned to
Europe during the 1990s, says his long pursuit of the family-run
company that controls Taittinger Champagne, Baccarat crystal and 70
fancy hotels including the Crillon in Paris is about to take a
critical turn, probably in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, he said, a French court will hear him present his
challenge to the management of Anne-Claire Taittinger, chairman of
the Societe du Louvre, and her family. For what amounts to a
mini-LVMH, he has bid $700 million, having already accumulated
about a 17 percent stake. While driving from his Geneva office to
Gstaad for the weekend, he called himself an active investor but,
please, not a hostile one. ``My intentions are to get control,'' he
said. ``Stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taittinger said that Edelman had held his investment for
more than two years and that French law gave him little hope. ``He
is not a threat,'' she said. Ms. Taittinger swung through New York
recently to promote a new line of Baccarat crystal from Barbara
Barry, the interior designer (a greenish glass for red wine: $245).
</P>
<P>
   At the Baccarat store, she wore a crystal necklace and ring to a
dinner that included Chien Chung Pei. the architect (son of I.M.),
and Barbara de Portago, whose status on the social circuit helps
bring business to clients including Sotheby's and Christian Dior. &QL;

   At Akamai, Aloha to Decorum &QL;

<P>
   At Akamai Technologies, they take their Hawaiian inspiration
seriously. Paul Sagan, president of Akamai, which means
``intelligent and clever'' in Hawaiian, bet his sales staff members
last year that they could not sign up 200 clients by Dec. 31.
Akamai, based in the rather chilly precincts of Cambridge, Mass.,
provides a network of computer servers to improve the performance
of its clients' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The sales representatives came through, so Sagan had to. By
their agreement, he put on a coconut bra and grass skirt to hula
dance for management earlier this month. ``It was fun,'' insisted
Sagan. &QL;

   Give Laura Rippy credit: In a two-career marriage, she found a
way to switch jobs without switching regions. Late last year, she
moved from a job with Microsoft in Dallas to become chief executive
of Handango, a Dallas-based seller of software for handheld
computers. At Microsoft, Ms. Rippy was a fast-tracker: founder of
HomeAdvisor.com, the real estate Web site, and co-founder of
Sidewalk.com, the entertainment site.
</P>
<P>
   As Laura Bordewieck, she had met Dan Rippy in the fifth grade in
Wellesley, Mass. They remained only friends until four years ago.
``We were home for Christmas in 1995 and the light bulb went on,''
she said. He soon left Bristol-Myers Squibb in New Jersey and
joined her in Seattle. ``The deal was that he would come to Seattle
for my job, but when he found something that he really liked, I
would move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, when Rippy was offered a position as an
executive responsible for developing new businesses with Johnson &AMP;
Johnson in Dallas, he accepted. Microsoft then arranged for Ms.
Rippy to work in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Rippy's advice: ``You and your partner need to clearly
articulate your goals and expectations so that no one will feel
like they are getting the short end of the deal.''

   Friends with otherwise hostile Middle East leaders, husband of
the state's most celebrated socialite, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr. defined
the role of Texas oilman so well that the Houston Chronicle once
quoted a source comparing him to J.R. Ewing (famously combative, he
sued, contending the comment was fabricated).
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Coastal Corp., founded by Wyatt in 1955, agreed
to be bought by El Paso Energy for $9.7 billion. At age 75, Wyatt
remained Coastal's executive committee chairman and largest
individual shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Among his exploits were flying with John B. Connally to visit
Saddam Hussein in late 1990 and returning home with a planeload of
freed hostages. At an OPEC meeting in Vienna last year, he was
still meeting oil ministers from nations like Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to keep the contact with these huge oil
producers when these sanctions come off,'' he said, without
confirming whom he had met.
</P>
<P>
   And what if Wyatt still wants to go find some oil himself? He
still owns the first venture he founded, the Hardly Able Oil Co.

CLINTON TO SEEK U.S. SUBSIDIES TO HELP THE POOR GET ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ President Clinton has decided to seek federal
subsidies to help the poor buy computers and connect to the
Internet, one of a number of initiatives to be included in his
State of the Union address to narrow what many call the digital
divide, White House aides said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the program is still being put together, the White
House is considering an initiative to offer roughly $50 million in
competitive grants to local communities and organizations that are
involved in efforts to help low-income families go online.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton set a goal last year of connecting everyone in the
United States to the Internet, in schools, libraries and businesses
as well as private homes. Later this year, the president plans to
take a third ``new markets'' tour to highlight communities left
behind in the nation's economic boom. The trip will focus on the
digital divide and involve leaders in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative to increase computer usage among low-income
families is not intended to create more video game addicts or chat
room participants. Instead, as Clinton said in December, connecting
more Americans to computers would help ``to link children and
adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant
medical care, to empower parents, to assist job-seekers, to enhance
safety and foster economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is relatively new to the Internet himself. In a
speech Friday announcing increased financing for scientific
research, he told students at the California Institute of
Technology that he was technically challenged but was trying to get
in touch with his ``inner nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff challenged me to actually order Christmas gifts over
the Internet, and I did that,'' Clinton said. ``And while doing
that, I learned that with just a click of a mouse, I could actually
order _ and I did this, I'm embarrassed to say _ I ordered Arkansas
smoked ham and sausage delivered to my door.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computer executives in the Silicon Valley have proposed a
program called ClickStart, with the goal of connecting millions of
impoverished Americans to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which the company officials pushed in a meeting
with presidential aides in December, proposes to subsidize through
a voucher system both computer hardware and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Each recipient would pay about $5 a month and get a $10 monthly
federal subsidy in the form of a voucher that could be used to buy
hardware and Internet access from any vendor participating in the
program, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all clearly self-serving at some level because all of
us in the industry benefit by having more customers,'' said Eric
Schmidt, chief executive of Novell and one of the organizers of the
program. ``All technology literacy programs have a self-serving
component to them, and if I state that up front it takes that off
the table. I happen to believe it's good for society, and for our
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study made public last year found that
black and Hispanic families were only two-fifths as likely to have
Internet access as white households. Families with incomes of
$75,000 or more in urban areas are more than 20 times as likely to
have Internet access as the poorest households. Rural areas feature
the lowest percentage of connected households.
</P>
<P>
   Education is another big factor. People with a college degree
are more than eight times as likely to have a computer at home and
nearly 16 times as likely to have home Internet access as those
with an elementary school education.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says more than half of the nation's schools
and more than 80 percent of its classrooms are wired for the
Internet. The goal is to have all schools connected by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that passes, there are children not being exposed to
PCs and the Internet,'' said Nick Grouf, chief executive of
PeoplePC, a company in San Francisco that sells low-cost computer
systems. ``That means they are de facto being left out of the
economy 10 to 15 years from now, and that's a very frightening
prospect.''

INVESTING WITH ROBERT A. LOEST: IPS MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of IPS Millennium fund is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody can accuse Robert A. Loest, a self-proclaimed futurist,
of missing the big picture with his radically esoteric investment
strategy. ``Instead of looking at where we are in the economic
cycle to decide which sectors to invest in,'' said Loest, who runs
the $198.7 million IPS Millennium fund, ``we look at where
civilization is going.''
</P>
<P>
   If that description seems a mite abstract, well, the fund's
returns show that its results are concrete. It returned 53.4
percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Jan. 14,
compared with 29.8 percent a year for its peer group of large
growth funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   IPS Millennium holds 67 stocks, most of them high-flying
technology issues. But he balances that by investing a portion of
the fund in staid utilities, banks and other, often
high-dividend-paying stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Loest's take on business and markets is quite different from
that of most money managers. ``We view the economy as an ecosystem,
like an oak forest or a tropical coral reef,'' he said from his
office in Knoxville, Tenn. These days, he said, the most successful
businesses are those that cooperate extensively with other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperation, not competition, is the ruling paradigm,'' said
Loest, 56. ``Any time one company makes a change, the effects are
felt by every other company, like an ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective is not surprising for Loest, who holds a
doctoral degree in biology and worked in basic research until the
mid-1970s, when he left the field rather than perform experiments
on animals. He then worked as a blacksmith until 1985, when a
financial planner for whom he shod horses urged him to consider a
money management career.
</P>
<P>
   As befits his iconoclastic stance, Loest disregards company
earnings, growth rates, intrinsic worth and other commonly used
valuation measures. ``The value of companies in the new information
economy depends more on their degree of connectivity than on the
company's internal assets,'' he said. Connectivity, he explained,
is the degree to which they influence other companies and the depth
of their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   So, Loest said, he looks at the number of continuing
relationships a company has, as well as the level of dominance it
has in its market.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Yahoo, one of the fund's top five holdings. Its worth
is minimal according to many valuation methodologies, he said, but
extensive in light of all the relationships it has formed with
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The fund looks at all but the very smallest companies, seeking
out those dominant ones with ``the most highly developed ecosystem
built around what they do,'' Loest said. This often means those
that have created the technological standards around which other
companies operate, like Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he measures connectivity by assessing a company's
marketing relationships, joint development projects, products and
services. Loest is especially keen on companies with what he calls
disruptive technology or business models that can overturn
established dominant companies. He cited Amazon.com, which threw
the retail book market for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   Prices do matter. Typically, he said, he waits to buy shares in
companies only after they fall 30 percent to 50 percent from their
12-month high. Loest often sells a stock when it has fallen more
than its peers for three to four consecutive quarters and no one
seems to know why.
</P>
<P>
   He originally bought shares of Yahoo in July 1997, at a
split-adjusted price of $6.50 apiece. He added shares last summer,
when the price dropped to $135, less than half its 12-month high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo lets people and businesses connect in totally new
ways,'' Loest said. ``I view it as the dominant stock in its
space.'' Its only close competitor, America Online, which the fund
also holds, is pursuing a very different business model, he said.
AOL is restricting its content to proprietary products and trying
to get as much of it as possible, as evidenced by its plans to
acquire Time Warner, which has had a hard time adapting to the
Internet, Loest noted.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo management is innovative, he said, adding calendars,
address lists and other personal services to its search-engine
functions. ``They looked at how people were using the product,'' he
said, ``and were imaginative in adding features.'' Yahoo shares
closed Friday at $351.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest position, at 6.7 percent of assets, is JDS
Uniphase, of San Jose, Calif., which makes fiber optic transmission
components. The technology is critical, Loest said, as the world
becomes highly connected through fiber optics and wireless data
transmission. The company makes most of the equipment that lets
fiber optic strands transmit data, dominating its market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase is the dominant company within its ``ecosystem,''
Loest said, as it has acquired most of its competitors. Last week,
it agreed to buy E-Tek Dynamics, a San Jose, Calif.-based rival,
for stock valued at $15 billion. He originally bought shares in
Uniphase in September 1998 for $22 apiece. Shares closed Friday at
$233.125.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite electric utilities is Calpine, also of San
Jose, which builds miniature power plants using combined cycle
natural gas turbines. It is a relatively straightforward
deregulation play. The plants are so small and efficient, Loest
said, that office building complexes, and eventually individuals,
will be able to disconnect from the main power grid. They produce
electricity for about 1 cent per kilowatt hour, compared with 4 to
6 cents for traditional electric companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loest originally bought shares in June 1998 for $9 each. They
closed Friday at $87.1875.

ANOTHER BOOM IN BIOTECHNOLOGY STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's raining money on the biotechnology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investors, their pockets flush with Internet returns,
have discovered the world of genomics, monoclonal antibodies and
biochemistry laboratories on a chip, and within a few weeks have
turned what had been a financing drought into a deluge.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange's Biotechnology Index is up 25.6
percent just this year.
</P>
<P>
   There have been wild biotechnology run-ups before, most notably
in 1991, but nothing like this. Stocks of the leading genomics
companies, those that decipher human genes, are up as much as
tenfold from their 52-week lows. Recent public offerings by
biotechnology companies like Tularik, the Caliper Technologies and
Maxygen have taken off like Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is biotech's time,'' said Mark Edwards, president of
Recombinant Capital, a San Francisco research firm. He said as many
as 70 biotechnology companies were poised to become public within
the next few months, if the market holds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors warmed earliest to mature biotechnology stocks like
Amgen and Genentech, but the current boom was ignited by the
genomics companies, which have piggybacked on the multinational
effort to identify all the genes in the human body. By finding,
sequencing and patenting genes ahead of the publicly funded labs,
these companies hope to alter the way health care is practiced and
make lots of money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the entire genomics industry commanded a market
capitalization of less than $5 billion; now just one of them alone,
Millennium Pharmaceuticals is worth more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who bought genomic powerhouses like
Millennium, or Human Genome Sciences, both of which have traded
below $29 within the past year, looks like a genius given Friday's
closing prices of $200.625 and $221.875, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But gains like that have even some stalwarts moving money off
the table. ``I own the Amgens, and I have owned some of the
genomics companies, but at these levels it gets hard to rationalize
any investment,'' said Larry N. Feinberg of Oracle Partners LP, a
hedge fund. Nevertheless, he believes the gains are in many cases
justified. ``Almost every biotech drug is selling above
expectations, and the reason is these are better drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if justifying the rise in valuations is difficult, it is
even tougher to determine where, and how, to put money into the
group if you think there is still room for growth.
</P>
<P>
   For investors interested in the current market leaders, the
genomics companies, one tactic is to buy a fixed dollar amount at
regular intervals, to take advantage of any market pullbacks. ``For
the average investor, it's certainly not wise to plunge and put all
your money into genomics today, so you dollar-cost average,'' said
Jeffrey Casdin, president of Casdin Capital Partners, a fund that
owns several kinds of biotechnology stocks. ``You can't be a market
timer.''
</P>
<P>
   Casdin said he saw the genomics companies accelerating their
progress from scientific discoveries to novel drugs and diagnostic
tests.
</P>
<P>
   One can also mitigate risk by concentrating on companies with
near-term product potential, although most of those stocks have
already run up. Dennis Purcell, managing director for life sciences
at Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said he believed some companies would
grow into their valuations. ``We do have over 300 products in
late-stage clinical trials and a lot of those will pan out,'' he
said. ``You are always going to make money on companies that are
going to have products.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell currently favors ImClone Systems, which is in the final
stages of clinical trials on a novel cancer drug. ImClone closed
Friday at $66.75, or more than six times its 52-week low of $9.
</P>
<P>
   Another tack is to seek out those companies that have solid
fundamentals but are out of favor for one reason or another. These,
however, are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   As a long-term biotech investor looking for value, Viren Mehta,
a fund manager at Mehta Partners, says his current favorite is Elan
Corp. of Dublin. Because Elan has a number of products on the
market, it is valued like a mid-cap drug company, but it is really
a biotechnology firm in disguise, with a novel pain drug in the
late stages of clinical trials, and a vaccine for Alzheimer's just
entering the clinic. ``Elan is down 25 percent when everyone else
is skyrocketing,'' he said. Its American Depositary Receipts closed
at $26 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the best play may be big drug companies, which have
biotechnology assets, products, and in many cases, low stock
prices. ``Pharmaceutical large-cap stocks worldwide have been
punished badly, despite the big consolidation under way,'' Mehta
said. ``Large pharma companies are really nothing but large biotech
companies.''

CATERPILLAR'S 4TH-QUARTER PROFITS FALL 21 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Caterpillar Inc., the maker of construction and
earth-moving equipment, said on Friday that its fourth-quarter
profits fell 21 percent from a year ago, largely because of slowing
demand in North America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had warned of a fourth-quarter profit
slowdown in November, said that it now expects a modest recovery
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2000, we anticipate sales and revenues and profits will
improve, with higher sales expected in every region of the world
except North America,'' Glen Barton, the chief executive at
Caterpillar, said in a statement. ``We'll continue to carefully
manage costs and move forward with our growth initiatives while
delivering solid financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, however, say that company executives
encouraged them to lower their 2000 earnings expectations and that
the company is now expecting a sales and profit gain of up to 7
percent this year, not the 20 percent gain analysts were
projecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had given overly optimistic guidance in 1998 and 1999 and
then the stock underperformed for two years because of quarter
after quarter of profit slowdowns,'' said David Bluestein, an
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``I think they are now trying to
err on the side of being conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar rose 25 cents Friday, to 47.375, on the
New York Stock Exchange. For the week, shares of Caterpillar were
down 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has repeatedly warned of earnings slowdowns
in the last year, said that it earned $239 million, or 67 cents a
diluted share, on revenue of $5.02 billion in the fourth quarter of
1999. The results were slightly above Wall Street's reduced
expectations of 64 cents a share. In the fourth quarter of 1998,
Caterpillar had profits of $301 million, or 83 cents, on revenue of
$5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Caterpillar earned $964 million, or $2.63 a share,
on revenue of $19.7 billion, down from $20.9 billion a year ago,
when profits topped $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the slowdown in North America and Latin America, the
company blamed a strong dollar, weaker sales of more expensive
machinery, like mining vehicles, and efforts to trim inventory as
the cause for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar did, however, see record demand for its truck
engines in 1999 and strong growth in its financial products
division, such as its insurance offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker commodity prices and a slowdown in what has been a boom
in construction and home building in the United States is expected
to be offset this year by a global recovery creating stronger
demand for construction and earth-moving equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., had been suffering
from a recession in Asia and a sharp drop in demand for its mining
machinery in 1997 and 1998. But executives say a recovery in the
rest of the world, which began in 1998, will more than offset a
slowdown in North America, where about 50 percent of its products
are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a sharp drop in truck sales could also clip strong
truck engine sales at Caterpillar this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who just over a year ago were forecasting
profits of about $5 a share in the year 2000, are now expecting
gains of about $2.80 a share to $3 a share, down from estimates
earlier this week of about $3.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street is holding out hope for a stronger-than-expected
recovery at Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, the market for construction equipment in
America is not very good,'' said Tobias Levkovich, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``But international sales may come back and
mining may come back. The earnings estimates will come down but I
think the company is being very, very conservative.''

 &HT;    President Allison Vulgamore, reinventing the idea of symphony
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 4:15 p.m. on a Wednesday, and Allison Vulgamore
is crouched by the piano in the living room of her Ansley Park
home. A photographer is taking her picture, and a reporter has just
arrived for dinner. Her husband, Peter Marshall, is in the kitchen.
He's baked a pumpkin pie. The table's set. But he's pacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she's just dying for a martini,'' he says
sympathetically, wondering if he should fix a drink for his wife of
20 years. But despite a wretched case of flu and a whispery voice,
Vulgamore _ the 41-year-old Atlanta Symphony Orchestra president
who's spent a good chunk of her seven-year tenure negotiating her
way out of uncomfortable positions _ looks buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, she'll swoop into the kitchen to orchestrate a
meal with the authority of a cooking-show hostess, declining a
martini for a glass of white wine. Completely in control, yet
relaxed, she bounces down the back steps to her garden, where she
snips herbs and shows off a sprawling rosemary bush. ``I wanted it
to be big, wild and free,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like me.''
</P>
<P>
   For a woman who's run the ASO with an iron glove, Vulgamore is
showing a remarkably human touch these days. After a candid
conversation at an Atlanta wine bar, she has agreed to let a
reporter visit her home. But as the dinner unfolds, there's news:
When the orchestra announces its new artistic leadership in
mid-February, it intends to break new ground by naming more than
one conductor to replace Yoel Levi. There will be one person in
charge, but it will be a collaborative team, Vulgamore says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see if it is possible to bring the best and
brightest and have them work together, not a tyrannical podium but
one that is nurtured by a collaborative team of experts,'' she
says. ``We are going forward with a sort of think tank ... a hotbed
of thinking and experimentation.'' (On the short list are Robert
Spano, Alan Gilbert, Donald Runnicles, Sir Roger Norrington, Marin
Alsop and Roberto Abbado.)
</P>
<P>
   But as Vulgamore reinvents the ASO, she is smart enough to know
that this is the moment to polish her own image. Even A.D. Frazier
Jr., the ASO board chairman who recently extended her contract for
five years, admits she can be difficult. ``I had to get used to her
at first. She came across to me as a little bit standoffish and
aloof.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Woodruff Arts Center President Shelton g. Stanfill, ``She
tells me what to do sometimes.'' He is only half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of bright people she doesn't try to hide that,''
says Charles Olton, president of the American Symphony Orchestra
League in New York. ``She knows the answer, and she tells you what
it is. Sometimes people don't react too well to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One big fan of Vulgamore's is former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller,
whose love of music is well-known. ``She's put a human face on the
symphony that was not there before,'' says Miller. ``I believe
there are many in the Atlanta community who, when it came to
classical music, could take it or leave it. Now they have taken it
because of Allison and found out they loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore and Marshall live in a white two-story clapboard house
that looks as if it were plucked from a New England village and
reassembled on 17th Street. In the living room, there's an elegant
rose-colored sofa and a harpsichord. Marshall is a free-lance
musician and keyboard teacher. He says he's just finished reading
the biography of the late Frank Muir. You remember Frank Muir: He
was one of the regulars on the long-running British radio quiz show
``My Word.'' After Vulgamore puts out appetizers _ raw fennel to be
dipped in olive oil, grilled portobellos, a bowl of olives _
everyone gathers in the living room, and Marshall plays a little
Bach on the harpsichord. A visitor says it's like a scene from a
Vermeer painting, and Vulgamore nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live very closely together in the name of music and in the
name of sanity,'' she says later. When asked if they plan to have
children, she says, ``Right now our hands are quite full.''
</P>
<P>
   On the living room mantel are mementos from her career at the
New York Philharmonic _ rocks from the Berlin Wall, which fell
during Leonard Bernstein's historic 1989 concert, when Vulgamore
was general manager. On a lamp table by the fireplace is a Russian
lacquer box, a gift from one of her heroes, former National
Symphony Orchestra conductor Mstislav Rostropovich. ``He knew I
liked snow scenes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern determination
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore's heritage is reflected in the solid Ohio primitives
in the dining room. There's her grandmother's pie chest and a white
tureen exactly like the one in the Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving
scene at the High Museum of Art. Parked out front is her dark teal,
four-door Volvo. The front license plate says Atlanta Symphony
Youth Orchestra, but the tag is thoroughly dented _ evidence that
Vulgamore is not the kind of driver to dawdle over parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Mel Vulgamore, a Methodist circuit preacher from
Ohio who went on to become president of Albion College in Michigan,
her aura is that of a woman who knows exactly where she's headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will consider myself a failure if we don't get a new hall,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it was Vulgamore who persuaded the Arthur M.
Blank Family Foundation to put $15 million on the former First
Baptist Church site where BellSouth offered to give the ASO land
for a new hall. When the $113 million project fell through in
September, Vulgamore's colleagues say she was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   And even she admits she was caught off guard when the Woodruff
Arts Center, the ASO's parent organization, announced it was hiring
Renzo Piano to redesign its campus master plan. ``I read about it
in the newspaper,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder if Woodruff leaders are talking
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While the arts center waits to see if Piano can fit a hall onto
the existing campus, Vulgamore has been busy playing Piano. She
recently flew to Europe to articulate the symphony's needs to the
famed Italian architect and his workshop. While the High Museum
appears certain to get a new wing out of the Piano relationship and
the Atlanta College of Art a new dormitory and sculpture studio,
the symphony has no such guarantees. But since the ASO's $23
million budget accounts for 60 percent of the total Woodruff Arts
Center budget, Vulgamore and Frazier are determined to protect its
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advances, but regrets, too
</P>
<P>
   Since her arrival in 1993, Vulgamore has stabilized the
organization by erasing its $4 million accumulated debt and
balancing four of the past five seasons' budgets.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good part.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part is that along the way, six musicians were nearly
let go. Players went on a bitter 10-week strike in 1996. Levi's
contract was extended for only two years, and his partisans tried
to take over the board to get him reinstated. The headlines came
thick and fast, and the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   But during one remarkable week in November, Vulgamore staged two
events that could have a major impact on the welfare of the
symphony and the community. On Nov. 20, in a move intended to
assuage the ill will created by Levi's dismissal, the ASO board
named him music director emeritus. Three days later, the orchestra
and musicians announced they'd reached a four-year contract _
meaning, in effect, that a strike like the one that crippled the
orchestra in 1996 won't be repeated any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the path that has brought her to this moment,
Vulgamore says she has one major regret. ``I will always remember
the nontenuring of the six players with extraordinary sadness. In
fact, if you look at my desk, there are six empty music stands and
chairs in a sketch that I bought at Tanglewood right afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that could have been handled differently. We didn't
have the money. I raised the money within six months. But I think I
could have handled that more personally with the orchestra, and
I'll carry that with me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she has no qualms about the debt erasure,
long-range planning and changes in board governance, which has made
the election of board members the labor of the board and not the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra League. All this, she says, ``makes us
so focused that we can capture our concert hall.''

   ATLANTA: our concert hall.''
</P>
<P>
   More changes
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen Vulgamore lately, you might not recognize
her. She's lost weight. She gets up every day at 5 and goes to the
gym next to the ASO office, or she jogs. She's traded in those
matronly red and purple suits for form-fitting black turtlenecks
and stylishly tailored pantsuits. And lately, her colleagues have
witnessed a more relaxed leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed over the last year and a half that she has
loosened up,'' Frazier says. ``She's throttled back in intensity,
and I think that's good for her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very soft core, but I don't believe some people know
that,'' says Helga Hazelrig Siegel, who was Vulgamore's personal
assistant from 1994 to 1999. Siegel was recommended for the job by
an old friend _ Yoel Levi. But much to her credit, she never took
sides during the turmoil surrounding his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky arrival
</P>
<P>
   Siegel tells a poignant story about the events of Sept. 12,
1998. After a Kathleen Battle concert at the ASO, Siegel was hit by
a car while crossing Peachtree Street. At the emergency room,
``They said I could go home if somebody stayed with me, and that's
when Allison jumped in and said, `I will do that.' She and Peter
both came, and I will never forget that.'' When Siegel got married
in November, she asked Vulgamore to be an attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel says that her former boss had a hard time when she
arrived at the ASO. She was only 35, one of just two women in
charge of a major U.S. orchestra; the other is Deborah Borda, now
at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under whom Vulgamore was general
manager at the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not a Southerner,'' says Siegel. ``She was a little
bit in awe of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore is a formidable presence. But she is in the unenviable
position of having to deal with the complexities of the Woodruff
Arts Center's structure, which means she must answer to the ASO
board and the Woodruff board. Says John W. Spiegel, the Woodruff
board chairman and chief financial officer of SunTrust Bank: ``We
have had some formal business conversations that were open and
honest, where we disagreed about something but didn't get huffy,
but became very factually oriented. ... There are only a few cases
where that ever happened. We get through those very easily and very
quickly and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nothing near what we had when Ofelia Garcia was here,''
he says, referring to the feisty former president of the Atlanta
College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   It is Woodruff policy not to disclose salaries, but Frazier has
been quoted as saying Vulgamore's tops $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   An idea takes shape
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the musicians' contract was ratified in
November, Vulgamore was on a plane to meet with architect Piano and
his staff in Berlin and Italy. The ASO president, who studied to be
an opera singer and is conversant in Italian and several other
languages, struck up a conversation with Piano and put a flea in
his ear about how a new hall might anchor the Woodruff campus.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day of meetings, she said she told the architect:
```Signor, you've said that the High Museum is like a delicate
ballerina, poised at an angle on the corner of Peachtree and 16th.
Have you considered having another, perhaps slightly bulkier,
ballerina at the opposite end of the campus, facing each other and
dancing together?'''
</P>
<P>
   After thinking a second, she said the architect responded,
```Ay! Siiiiiiiiiiiiii!''' Yes! He liked that idea very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply asked if he had ever considered a different shape and
a different location for the concert hall than one that was
dictated by the availability of space,'' she continues over dinner,
``because what I was seeing was that the space not only dictated
the concert hall shape, but inevitably it dictated the shape of the
performance space inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one of the things we talked at great length about is that
orchestras think about building a concert hall, a symphony center,
from the inside out, not from the outside in. In other words, we
begin with acoustics, and we need the freedom to float different
shapes in a concert hall. He was very forthcoming and is still
thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's barely 8 p.m., but the evening is winding down. Marshall is
serving the pumpkin pie. Vulgamore's tireless front has collapsed
into paroxysms of coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once told the paper, `Yes, we are in a difficult time, but
you are going to watch and see how we come out of it, because
that's going to be one heck of a story.' So the rolling out of a
new artistic director will be a very exciting story. ... We can now
go back to investing in music, which is where we wanted to be all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT UP AT THE ASO
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday. $19-$49. Paavo Jarvi, guest conductor.

 &HT;    `Sopranos' star a reluctant celebrity
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ He is the very model of a modern major
mobster.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini, aka Tony Soprano, shuns the limelight the way
a real capo would shun a tour of FBI headquarters. Doesn't do talk
shows; ``I'd be dreading it for a week to come,'' he says. Doesn't
do hardly any interviews. Yet he's the lead in one of the most
talked-about phenomena in contemporary culture, HBO's ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable'' dealing with the celebrity aspects of
his job, he says. ``I don't think I'm that interesting. The
character is interesting, the writing is interesting, the show is
interesting. Me?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, him. James Gandolfini, 38, lifelong New Yorker, who spent
10 years doing theater and small, usually thuggish movie roles
(Bear in ``Get Shorty''), and who showed up, reluctant but a good
sport, at the Television Critics Association convention in Pasadena
to talk about himself as little as he could get away with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have imagined a part that would come along and do
something like this,'' he says. ``If you'd asked me two years ago
if I wanted something like this (the acclaim), I would have had to
really hesitate.''
</P>
<P>
   Up close and personal, Gandolfini is both like and unlike Tony,
the Prozac-popping, mother-obsessed New Jersey gangster who
struggles to balance his life as suburban family man and dead-eyed
killer. The beefy build is the same, as is the heavy but expressive
face. The Jersey accent, however, is Tony, not Gandolfini. (``She's
dead t'me,'' Tony says of his elderly, bedridden mother, who tried
to have him whacked.)
</P>
<P>
   His life, he says, ``really hasn't changed that much. I live in
the same place. Yeah, more people recognize me, I get a lot of `Hey
Tony' from cars and stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had very few instances where people were rude or
unfriendly or anything. If you just say, `I can't do this right
now,' people are very cool. Maybe it's New York City, but I find
people extremely cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini wasn't sure he wanted to play Tony, even after he
read creator David Chase's script. Chase originally wrote ``The
Sopranos'' as a feature film years ago, and when it went
unproduced, adapted it to a TV series that other networks,
especially Fox, considered but passed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the script, and the only trepidation I had was that it
was basically TV,'' he says. ``I understood the guy, and I didn't
think they would cast me. I thought it would be a different looking
_ fit _ guy,'' he adds with a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia turns to the show
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is so authentic feeling that reportedly
mobsters themselves are fans; wiretaps have picked up conversations
among wiseguys talking about the show's sensibility. And a few guys
claiming to be ``connected'' have occasionally approached
Gandolfini, he says, to wish him well. ``But I like to think that
the smarter mobsters are the ones who don't come up to TV actors,''
he cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The second episode, which airs Sunday, in the show's second
season finds Tony involved in a labor dispute in which black
protesters are picketing a construction site that his ``waste
management consultant'' business has a contract with. In future
episodes, Tony gets a new enemy, a fresh-from-jail made guy named
Richie Aprile with a very short fuse (Jan. 30), and travels to
Italy to check on some business concerns (Feb. 8).
</P>
<P>
   What isn't happening so far _ and what drove much of the show's
first season _ are scenes between Tony and his Machiavellian mama
Livia (Nancy Marchand), and between Tony and his shrink, Dr. Melfi
(Lorraine Bracco).
</P>
<P>
   He says he felt ``out of sorts'' a lot during the second
season's filming, which just wrapped a few days ago in New Jersey,
because he missed playing opposite Marchand and Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   And still, despite an Emmy nomination as best actor last year,
the critical hosannas, the reported massive bump in salary, the
articles about him being an unlikely sex symbol, he finds time to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks sometimes about what happened to another hot TV show,
``Twin Peaks.'' ``Everyone went nuts for a certain year or
something like that, and then it was like whoooooh,'' and he makes
a sound and a face like air rushing out of a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   So he doesn't let himself think about his place in the pantheon.
``I don't think we feel like we're making a classic. I mean, if you
came down to the set, you'd see right away. We're just doing
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday on HBO.

 &HT;    PBS' `Culture Shock' examines controversies
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book, I wouldn't
a tackled it,'' Mark Twain wrote more than a century ago in the
voice of his greatest creation, young Huckleberry Finn.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, the trouble that revered and reviled book has caused.
The making of ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was nothing
compared to the ire it can raise today, when African-American
students read it in high school and come across the use, over and
over and over, of that nastiest of racial epithets, commonly
referred to as ``the n word.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the flash points _ one of many _ in ``Culture
Shock,'' a new four-part PBS series about controversies in the
arts. It wrestles with the legacy of ``Huck Finn'' in today's
hypersensitive high schools; looks deeply at Edouard Manet's famous
nude ``Olympia,'' and why it scandalized a Parisian art culture
that was full of painted nudes; examines what Hollywood films could
and couldn't get away with in the '30s under the rigorous
Production Code; and wonders why jazz in the 1920s got the
established orders foaming at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, violence and dirty words are usually more a staple on Fox _
``World's Most Shocking Masterpieces!'' _ than on PBS, but
``Culture Shock'' considers them thoughtfully, and what they say
about us.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment, on ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' is
the most challenging, in part because the controversy over Twain's
language is more bristly today than ever. It's also the longest, at
90 minutes; the other three are an hour each.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book took some hits when it was published in 1885
(it was banned by some libraries as ``trash''), it didn't become a
major racial issue until the 1950s, when the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People attacked it for its
``belittling racial designations,'' mainly about the runaway slave
Jim, who accompanies Huck on his journey down the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture Shock'' takes us to Tempe, Ariz., where a high school
student and her mother recently launched a crusade to boot ``Huck''
from the curriculum because the ``n word'' upset them. Their
complaints are cross-cut with scholars and critics, most of them
African-American, explaining, as one puts it, ``Twain knows the
word is unacceptable _ that's part of the point; Huck is struggling
with the racism that's part of his character.''
</P>
<P>
   More layers are added, from the mighty-white boosterish
celebrations of Twain in his native Hannibal, Mo., which skips
``Huck'' (too controversial) and elevates nice, safe Tom Sawyer; to
modern African-American entertainers such as Chris Rock and gangsta
rappers who use the ``n word'' liberally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the book that's the problem, it's current
attitudes,'' says David Bradley, a black writer. ``That word still
has power,'' he adds, as the show plays excerpts from the
devastating Mark Fuhrman testimony during the O.J. Simpson criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The show clearly favors the critical argument that ``Huck Finn''
is anti-racist and deserves its respected spot in the culture,
without belittling the novel's detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining three shows are insightful, but more limited,
because their subjects don't pack the same wallop as ``Huck Finn'';
their provocations lie in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Manet's ``Olympia,'' which once outraged the art world, is now
an established masterpiece hanging in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris;
Mae West's side-of-the-mouth double-entendres seem quaint,
bordering on wholesome, compared to what's on movie screens today;
the young genre of jazz that migrated from New Orleans brothels to
Harlem nightclubs is the soundtrack of our grandparents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   In their day, however, each demonstrated what art critic Robert
Hughes called ``the shock of the new.'' ``Olympia'' was deemed
``repulsive and ugly'' when it was unveiled in 1865 because the
reclining nude woman was obviously a prostitute rather than a
mythological figure, and her gaze challenged and mocked the viewer.
Jazz was condemned as ``jungle music,'' ``primitive and savage,''
code words for whites' fear of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jazz and movie segments make reference to
contemporary issues _ most pointedly the parallel between criticism
of early jazz and some rap today _ the ideas are not developed. And
the segment on ``Olympia'' should have jumped to recent flare-ups
such as the Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibit (with
its infamous dung-spattered Virgin Mary), or the works of Andres
Serrano or Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see now that ``Olympia'' is great art; hey, it's in
the Musee d'Orsay, so ipso facto. The challenge _ to viewers, and
the show itself _ would have been applying similar criteria to what
rattles our cages today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huck Finn'' airs at 9 p.m. Wednesday, followed at 10:30 p.m.
by ``Olympia.'' The episodes ``Hollywood Censored'' and ``The
Devil's Music'' air at 9 and 10 p.m. Feb. 2, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   PBS also has an excellent Web site for the show (www.pbs.org
</P>
<P>
   /cultureshock), which examines controversies besides the four
presented, including Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Lolita'' and Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda films. It also has material for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture Shock''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Wednesday and
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Grades: ``Huck Finn'' episode: A; other episodes: B.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: We may not know how to define art, but we know what
we don't like.

 &HT;    Genesis Shelter, training helps moms 'fill in gaps'
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toneka Sanders had fallen almost as far as can be
fallen, addicted to crack cocaine, six months pregnant, in jail for
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In jail, they would feed me and I would still be hungry, I
wouldn't be full, and I told them, `I'm not full,''' says Sanders.
``They told me, `We're not feeding you to fill you up. We're
feeding you to keep you alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a warm, sunny January day eight months later _ a lifetime
later _ and Sanders' son Demarcus is a healthy 5-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   He's down the hall, taking a midafternoon nap in Sanders' room
at the Genesis Shelter in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The room where Sanders unreels her story is full of light and
piped-in symphonic music.
</P>
<P>
   About the only word to describe the setting is cozy _ something
unimaginable to Sanders when she checked into the shelter almost
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   For two years she lived ``on the street,'' trading herself for
drugs and some place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for this place,'' says Sanders, a robust
26-year-old, ``I don't think me and my baby would have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' story is singular, and plural.
</P>
<P>
   BreNita Jackson-Brown, the shelter's executive director, has
heard more than 200 versions of it from more than 200 mothers who
have found refuge at Genesis since it opened five years ago. The
facility is Atlanta's only shelter devoted to homeless mothers with
newborns, and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, very often, we are a person's last hope,'' says
Jackson-Brown. ``And when they come here we are asking a lot of
them. We are asking them to do in a matter of months what it takes
most of us years to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeless shelters, part of the fabric of life in Atlanta, take
on the aspect of survival shelters during the cold winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis plays that part, but its primary purpose is as a way
station _ a restarting point _ for homeless mothers, their children
and families.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is funded by 16 faith groups in the city _
Presbyterian, Episcopal, Jewish, Methodist and Catholic
congregations _ with an annual budget of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides something nobody else in the city does,'' says the
Rev. Floyd Rhodes Jr., for three years a board member at Genesis,
and an associate presbyter for ethnic and urban concerns at the
Presbytery of Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ministry to families with newborn babies, and it
prepares them to go out, to get jobs and teaches them how to
negotiate the system of living and supporting yourself and your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The shelter has been filled from the day it opened and can house
as many as 12 families at a time. But it is temporary quarters.
Residents stay only three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come here, they have 10 days to fill out an action
plan, how they plan to leave here and start a new life,'' says
Jackson-Brown. ``We train them to break the cycle of
homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing, meals and child care are all provided, as are classes
in parenting, job training and drug recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
   The rules at the shelter are strict, and strictly enforced.
There are nightly curfews (8 p.m.), residents are responsible for
keeping their rooms and themselves clean, and they share in shelter
chores.
</P>
<P>
   If residents earn money while at the shelter, they are required
to report that income and save at least 50 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents, says Jackson-Brown, arrive at the shelter having
been abandoned by their families or abused by their partners, and
are ill-prepared for a life other than homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gaps in their lives,'' says Jackson-Brown, ``and a
lot of what we do is try to fill in those gaps _ education, how to
handle money, overcoming addiction, how to play with children _
with training.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the women are steered to the shelter by other support
groups, police or the local hospital (Grady Memorial Hospital),
after their children are born.
</P>
<P>
   The number of homeless people is difficult to determine because
it's a population constantly in flux and some people who are
homeless do not seek help in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, however,
estimated in 1999 that there are about 2 million people who
``experience homelessness'' during a single year in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless estimated in 1993 that
there are more than 40,000 metropolitan Atlantans homeless each
year. There are about 80 shelters to serve this population.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson-Brown remembers that two Christmases ago, police showed
up with a woman who had just delivered a child in an abandoned
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only accommodate 12 families,'' she says. ``But this
time of year, when it's cold or a cold and rainy evening, we will
not turn a mother and her baby away.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term residents are encouraged to bring their families
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of the family surviving, of breaking the cycle of
homelessness, is greater if the whole family is involved,'' says
Jackson-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Brown, 27, came to the shelter in 1995 with a 6-week-old
child, having split up with her boyfriend, with no place to stay
and no family to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later her boyfriend joined her at the shelter. She
found a job as a clerk at a quick-serve market. He found a new job.
A year later they married. Two weeks ago she took a new job earning
$30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now she works as a volunteer at the shelter. She and her
husband, Victor, 28, are still paying off the $35,000 in medical
bills accrued after their children, Myles, 4, and Jordan, 3, were
born. And they're saving to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the shelter, I wouldn't be stable, and my
son, Myles, would not be as happy and as smart as he is, and I
wouldn't be married, and I would probably be homeless now,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   After residents leave, the shelter still is a resource if they
fall on hard times. ``It takes a person five years to recover from
the emotional damage of homelessness and be fully integrated into
the community,'' says Jackson-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Toneka Sanders knows there are no guarantees, but she has an
apartment lined up _ her first home in two years, her first home
outside a housing project in her life.
</P>
<P>
   She is studying to pass her high school equivalency diploma
test. The court has granted her custody of her two other children,
taken away because of her drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's going to enroll in beauty school and cut hair for
a living, and her boyfriend has vowed to marry her once she has
been clear of drugs for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard to get to this point,'' she says. ``And I'm not
going back.''

 &HT;    Retired pachyderms find sanctuary in Tennessee
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 23
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOHENWALD, Tenn. _ Some animal lovers devote their lives to
saving stray dogs and cats. Carol Buckley thinks bigger than that.
A lot bigger.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the 46-year-old California native has
been rescuing elephants. So far, she has brought five aging and
infirm pachyderms to her 100-acre sanctuary in southwestern
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   To find Buckley, you have to navigate through this small,
nondescript farming town where explorer Meriwether Lewis committed
suicide and drive past the pawnshop and Dairy Dip. Two miles
outside of Hohenwald, you turn left onto a narrow dirt road, let
yourself in the gate with the ``Elephant Crossing'' sign and follow
the grassy path across a stream up the hill to a 9,000-square-foot
barn.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's cavernous office is upstairs, above the stalls where
Tarra, Barbara, Jenny, Shirley and Bunny congregate in cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   A small woman with straight blond hair and intense blue eyes,
Buckley is seated at a desk with a computer terminal and a video
system that monitors the animals' whereabouts. At the moment, she
is focusing the camera on ``the girls,'' as she calls them, as they
move about the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too cold for them to go outside,'' she says. ``So let's
go see what they're up to.'' No male elephants are adopted, she
explains, because they would be too disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   The barn is fancier than some loft apartments. Heated water
pipes have been built into the concrete floor, and there are
automatic waterers and a manure conveyor. A generator is primed to
kick in if the electricity goes out.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, a black-and-white dog, darts into the stall with Tarra
and rushes around the elephant's feet. ``They're best friends,''
Buckley says, stroking the elephant's side. Tarra shakes her head
and reaches out her trunk for the dog. Despite their difference in
size, it's clear they're playing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Easily trained, elephants are highly intelligent, Buckley says,
and can live to be 60 or 70 years old. ``Scientists say they have
30 times the capacity for memory that humans do. They form
intricate family structures and show compassion for one another
with intense interactions. They grieve for their dead in a more
than instinctive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Elephants that are kept in chains in captivity without contact
with other elephants become psychologically damaged, Buckley says.
``When Bunny first arrived, she was drastically underweight and she
was very intimidated by the others. Now she's added some weight and
she's extremely playful.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's partner, Scott Blais, hauls in more hay and a treat of
grapevines as Buckley explains her goal to eventually provide a
home for a dozen elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take in every elephant, but right now I can only
accept the sickest,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee may seem an odd place for an elephant sanctuary, but
Buckley insists that it's perfect. She and Blais settled on
Hohenwald after researching the climate and land costs in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best place we could find for the price,'' Buckley
says. ``California and Florida didn't have enough rainfall. And the
land has a good mixture of vegetation. We have three kinds of
bamboo, grapevines, blackberries and eight different grasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Through community support and contributions from wildlife
lovers, the couple has managed to make improvements, build the
impressive barn and keep the elephants (a sixth is scheduled to
arrive this month) housed and fed at a cost of about $250,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons range from ordinary citizens to celebrities such as pop
singer Amy Grant. Local businesses and major corporations have
donated generators and fencing; unpaid interns pitch in during the
summers; and volunteers clean and paint on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   School groups can view the elephants and ask questions via an
Internet site, but the sanctuary is closed to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to perform anymore,'' says Buckley, who
opposes the use of animals in circuses and zoos. ``We want them to
be elephants. Besides, visitors would be very disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's love affair with elephants began more than 25 years
ago, when she was a student at California's Moorpark College,
studying exotic animals. One day she saw a 6-month-old elephant
named Fluffy that had been purchased by the owner of a tire store.
``She was walking down the street on a rope,'' Buckley recalls,
``and the kids were teasing her. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered to take care of the elephant, and the owner agreed.
After a year, she talked her father into lending her $25,000 to buy
Fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Fluffy's name to Tarra, Buckley became her caretaker
and surrogate mother. For a time, they worked in amusement parks
and toured with the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the world's only roller-skating elephant,'' Buckley
says, laughing. Tarra also appeared on several TV shows and in the
movie ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Buckley took Tarra to a safari park in Ontario,
Canada, where she met Blais. Discovering that they were kindred
souls, the pair decided to find a place where they could care for
sick or old elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Usually such elephants have been kept in chains, Buckley says,
which damages their cartilage and can cause arthritis. Others have
been underfed or given the wrong kind of processed food. Elephants
prefer a variety of vegetation, she says, including fruits and
melons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buckley's plans for expansion are as big as ever.
``We want to acquire the 3,000 acres that surround us,'' she says.
``Then we'll build satellite facilities. Elephants need to stay in
viable groups of eight to 15. And we're developing a program to
establish wild habitats for elephants in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of her passel of pachyderms is a full-time job, but
Buckley says she wouldn't have it any other way. ``I don't want to
take vacations; I don't want to get away from this. If I had free
time, this is what I would do.''

 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a story about an anthrax epidemic in the former Soviet
Union in 1979 got to do with the global business climate in the
year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: it has something to do with why the phrase ``the
Reagan Revolution'' has so little rhetorical force, despite the
obvious worldwide benefits brought by the American initiatives of
those days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: the episode is connected in a certain fashion to
the Republican attempt to impeach President Clinton. So it bears on
this year's elections as well.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard now to recall the razor's edge on which the world
seemed to balance in 1979. With the inflation rate in the West
soaring towards 20 percent, China invaded Vietnam, US hostages were
taken captive captive in Iran, and the Soviet Union invaded
Afghanistan after staging a coup. In the midst of this turmoil,
credible allegations surfaced of a couple of instances of germ
warfare by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts reached the West of an anthrax epidemic in Sverdlovsk
in which between 40 and 1,000 persons were said to have died after
the accidental release of deadly spores from a military compund
long suspected by US intelligence experts of illicit manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, reports began to appear in the press of a
mysterious ``Yellow Rain,'' presumably a Russian biological weapon
containing deadly mycotoxins, being employed against Hmong
tribesmen in the mountains of Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of such news stemmed from the fact that the
Russians, like the American, had signed a 1972 treaty agreeing to
end the production and ban the use of biological and chemical
weapons. All the logic of dentente depended on the assumption that
the signatories were as good as their words.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian invasion of Afghanistan led Jimmy Carter to begin a
great defense buildup; Ronald Reagan redoubled the effort. ``Yellow
Rain'' in particular was trumpeted by the Wall Street Journal's
editorial page into a major foreign policy issue _ the counterpart
of its enthusiasm for ``supply side economics.'' The Reagan
Administration went so far as to formally accuse the Russians of
waging biological warfare in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In due course, an alternative explanation emerged for ``Yellow
Rain.'' After examining samples offered by the government as proof
of bio-warfare, Harvard University molecular biologist Matthew
Meselson proposed that the supposedly deadly agent might instead be
feces deposited by swarms of bees during cleansing flights after
long hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   No supporting evidence was adduced for the manufactured
mycotoxin theory of Yellow Rain; no delivery receptacles were
found, no human intelligence produced, no archival support
uncovered once Soviet ministries opened up. Meanwhile, much
evidence was marshalled to support the bee feces theory. So
``Yellow Rain'' gradually faded away _ until The Wall Street
Journal (and more or less only The Wall Street Journal) discovered
that Saddam Hussein was preparing to use the substance against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the anthrax epidemic, on the other hand, proved
more and more abundant, despite Soviet attempts to blame the
outbreak on black-market tainted meat. The Russians even sent a
trio of high ranking scientists to the United States to make their
case before the National Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
   With the Soviet Union coming apart, however, evidence continued
to pile up. A pathologist who had conducted autopsies of victims
brought forward evidence she had hidden from the KGB. A colleague
joined her inbringing it to light. A careful reporter for the Wall
Street Journal produced in its news pages a persuasive report.
Russian president Boris Yeltsin himself, who gone to school in
Sverdlovsk and who had risen to power as party secretary of its
region, publicly blamed the military. The city itself tore down its
statues of Stalin and voted to revert to its pre-revolutionary
name: Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   Now a definitive account of the affair has appeared _ ``Anthrax:
The Investigation of a Deadly Outbreak'' by Jeanne Guillemin, a
Boston College sociologist who just happens to be married to
Matthew Meselson. It is a masterpiece of investigative journalism
(``shoe-leather epidemiology,'' she would say): part detective
story, part courtroom drama, part history of the Soviet Union, part
meditation on the wickedness of governments.
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful book as well. It contains photographs of the
victims, taken from their headstones in the cemetary where they are
buried, photographs of the heroic pathologists who preserved their
evidence in paraffin for nearly 15 years, photographs of the genial
physicians who served as mouthpieces for the government cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Written in the heroic present, ``Anthrax'' permits us to look
over the shoulders of a team of five investigators, led by
Meselson, who visited Russian in the summer of 1992 in search of
answers. It offers vivid insights into how scientists actually work
_ the ceasless questioning from every conceivable angle view whose
goal is to eliminate doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpieces of the book are a pair of simple statisical
graphics. Near the beginning appears the official Russian version
of what happened: a simple little hand-drawn graph depicting
hospitalzation dates for 96 anthrax victims, 68 of whom died. It
shows a relatively slowly-unfolding outbreak that seems to support
the hypothesis of tainted meat.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the book is the epidemiological map that
perfectly summarizes all of Guillemin and Meselson's
investigations. It shows the daytime locations on Monday, April 2
of the 62 anthrax victims who were identified. They form a nearly
straight line extending five or six kilometers downwind from a
building called Compound 19. ``All the data _ from interviews,
documents, lists, autopsies and wind reports _ now fit like pieces
of a puzzle,'' writes Guillemin. ``What we know proves a lethal
plume of anthrax came from Compound 19.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Why? Guillemin interviews a general who
admits an aerosol chamber existed in Compound 19 big enough to
infect monkeys two at a time (and tiny compared to the
million-liter test chamber used for similar purposes at Fort
Detrick that the Americans called ``the Eight Ball.'') Was
contaminated air from an experiment released into the atmosphere
through a technological malfunction like Chernobyl? Sabotage, like
the incident at Bhopal? We'll never know, says Guillemin. All that
is certain is that the Russian authorities systematically lied
about the event.
</P>
<P>
   As relentlessly as the author seeks to keep the focus of her
book on that which can be proved, inevitably little bits of
personal politics creep in. John Reed, author of ``Ten Days That
Shook The World'' about the Russian Revolution, is her distant
cousin. The T-34 tank is ``the model that saved the Soviet Union
and the world from Nazi Germany.'' (Take that, Winston Churchill!)
Guillemin and Meselson present exactly the sort of respect for
others in positions of authority that you would expect from
committed arms-controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the most powerful passages in the book occurs when
the author describes what happens in the same year as the anthrax
outbreak when a river in western Siberia suddenly changes course
and a exposes the skeletons of thousand victims of a Stalin purge.
The KGB rushes to the riverbank to perform the same sort of damage
control. Cattle bones, they say _ and when nobody believes that,
they announce the dead were World War II deserters, and bury them
again.
</P>
<P>
   The anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk was real, and Guillemin and
Meselson have now brought the episode to closure, to a finish, a
fitting end, a conclusion. ``Yellow Rain'' was probably a figment
of the imagination of beleagured Hmong tribemen, but we'll never
know. The people who asserted its significance most passionately
have done nothing to resolve the matter. There has been no attempt
to come to grips with the criticism of their claims, no record of
the case, no summing up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the Right taken any note of the appearance of the
Guillemin book, save for a carping review in the New York Times
Book Review. The National Standard, the American Spectator, the
National Review _ and, of course, the Wall Street Journal's
editorial page _ have remained silent now that others have taken up
and wielded their cudgel with uncommon force.
</P>
<P>
   Such contempt for opinions of others has become a hallmark of
the Right in recent years. It is a commoplace now that the collapse
of communism left the Right without an enemy. As conservative
jurist Richard Posner has sagely observed in his recent book, ``An
Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment and Trial of
President Clinton,'' Bill Clinton demonstrated after 1992 a
remarkable knack for co-opting traditional conservative issues.
</P>
<P>
   These included, Posner notes, ``capital punishment, welfare
reform, sound money, a balanced budget, entitlement reform, and now
a quick-on-the-trigger military posture that arguably led to
repeated violations of the War Powers resolution _ that Democratic
icon that Republicans loved to denounce during Republican
presidencies and that Democrats accused Presidents Reagan and Bush
of repeatedly violating.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that remains,'' Posner writes, ``in light of Clinton's
flagrant appropriation of Republican policies, to fill the
indispensable role of the enemy is _ Clinton himself.'' Or as the
essayist Andrew Sullivan said, what the impeachment drive
demonstrated that ``the Right won't take yes for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know how the trial came out. In a smilar fashion,
``supply-side economics'' turned out to be snake oil and ``Yellow
Rain'' was the equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater.
``The Reagan Revolution'' was real enough, but it was betrayed by
its publicists. Part of the the significance of Guillemin's
``Anthrax'' story is that it exposes irresponsibility and points
the way to calmer times.

 &HT;    Winds of change are blowing at Weather Channel
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Weather Channel is changing like frost in the
midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   You still won't find pretty faces chitchatting about tornadoes
on the Atlanta-based cable TV channel. But it has added sharper,
better detailed local maps, news-driven shows and sweeping sunrises
as background sets.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring the Weather Channel's changing look and programming is
a revamped prime-time morning show called ``Your Weather Today.''
Running between 7 and 9 every weekday morning, the show represents
a stark break with Weather Channel tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Weather Today'' is not driven by a programmed lineup of
set features, but by weather news of the day. It's also fast-paced,
with the anchors scripted to trot across the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to give viewers quick, bite-size weather news they
can use in the morning,'' said Patrick Scott, the Weather Channel's
executive vice president and general manager of programming.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving ``Your Weather'' and the changes it represents is
years of viewer feedback and marketing surveys. That research
showed that, while people want local weather on a regular basis,
they also want good storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and the Weather Channel care about viewers because the
more they attract, the higher the ratings. And the higher the
ratings, the more advertising the channel attracts and the more it
can charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel is available in 74 million households. Last
year was a strong one in terms of viewership. Its average
prime-time viewership rating, as measured by Nielsen, rose 33
percent, from 0.3 to 0.4. That means about 370,000 households were
watching Weather Channel programming during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Turner Broadcasting's CNN averaged a Nielsen
rating of 0.8, or about 630,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   While strong, the Weather Channel wants to get stronger this
year. It wants to heighten the appeal of the channel's already
popular morning programming and lure people from movies and sitcoms
in the evening. Attracting viewers in the evening is a harder sell,
so the channel is first beefing up its morning programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might guess, we're weak in the evening, but we have
some of the highest ratings in cable TV during the morning hours,''
said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Live storm footage
</P>
<P>
   If you tune in to ``Your Weather,'' the first thing you'll
probably notice is the blazing orange sunrise as the backdrop for
the anchors. Next you'll see a semitransparent ribbon, like a stock
ticker, running along the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   This weather ticker, which runs throughout the daytime, offers a
continuous stream of local weather conditions. ``There's no waiting
for your local forecast,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes include detailed maps that include local rivers
and lakes. And gone are the cryptic military abbreviations for
locations. Now Marietta and Atlanta will be labeled as such.
</P>
<P>
   Gone also are the channel's talking heads. Now when an anchor
says it is snowing in Minneapolis the channel will cut in with live
footage.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the channel is sending several crews into big storms,
which will feed a continuing variety of footage and reports into
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking more like a news show,'' said Scott. In a first
for the channel, he has hired executive news producers from
broadcasting newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to tell the story better, make a weather event
more memorable,'' said Scott. But don't confuse the Weather Channel
with your local news broadcast. ``People don't want us to give them
the body counts from storms but how the weather affects their
life,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Weather Channel will do more shows about
climatic issues such as global warming and El Nino. Scott has
beefed up the channel's number of experts. In the past year he has
added experts in tornadoes, blizzards and storms in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   These experts won't be the anchors but will be interviewed by
the channel's on-air staff. The on-air personal are no
lightweights, either. Most are meteorologists by training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style remains straight from the shoulder,'' said Scott.
``It's about information, not fluff.''
</P>

ANTHRAX AND TAXES: THE MYSTERY SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000; resend fixes hed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a story about an anthrax epidemic in the former Soviet
Union in 1979 got to do with the global business climate in the
year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: it has something to do with why the phrase ``the
Reagan Revolution'' has so little rhetorical force, despite the
obvious worldwide benefits brought by the American initiatives of
those days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: the episode is connected in a certain fashion to
the Republican attempt to impeach President Clinton. So it bears on
this year's elections as well.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard now to recall the razor's edge on which the world
seemed to balance in 1979. With the inflation rate in the West
soaring towards 20 percent, China invaded Vietnam, US hostages were
taken captive captive in Iran, and the Soviet Union invaded
Afghanistan after staging a coup. In the midst of this turmoil,
credible allegations surfaced of a couple of instances of germ
warfare by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts reached the West of an anthrax epidemic in Sverdlovsk
in which between 40 and 1,000 persons were said to have died after
the accidental release of deadly spores from a military compund
long suspected by US intelligence experts of illicit manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, reports began to appear in the press of a
mysterious ``Yellow Rain,'' presumably a Russian biological weapon
containing deadly mycotoxins, being employed against Hmong
tribesmen in the mountains of Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of such news stemmed from the fact that the
Russians, like the American, had signed a 1972 treaty agreeing to
end the production and ban the use of biological and chemical
weapons. All the logic of dentente depended on the assumption that
the signatories were as good as their words.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian invasion of Afghanistan led Jimmy Carter to begin a
great defense buildup; Ronald Reagan redoubled the effort. ``Yellow
Rain'' in particular was trumpeted by the Wall Street Journal's
editorial page into a major foreign policy issue _ the counterpart
of its enthusiasm for ``supply side economics.'' The Reagan
Administration went so far as to formally accuse the Russians of
waging biological warfare in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In due course, an alternative explanation emerged for ``Yellow
Rain.'' After examining samples offered by the government as proof
of bio-warfare, Harvard University molecular biologist Matthew
Meselson proposed that the supposedly deadly agent might instead be
feces deposited by swarms of bees during cleansing flights after
long hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   No supporting evidence was adduced for the manufactured
mycotoxin theory of Yellow Rain; no delivery receptacles were
found, no human intelligence produced, no archival support
uncovered once Soviet ministries opened up. Meanwhile, much
evidence was marshalled to support the bee feces theory. So
``Yellow Rain'' gradually faded away _ until The Wall Street
Journal (and more or less only The Wall Street Journal) discovered
that Saddam Hussein was preparing to use the substance against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the anthrax epidemic, on the other hand, proved
more and more abundant, despite Soviet attempts to blame the
outbreak on black-market tainted meat. The Russians even sent a
trio of high ranking scientists to the United States to make their
case before the National Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
   With the Soviet Union coming apart, however, evidence continued
to pile up. A pathologist who had conducted autopsies of victims
brought forward evidence she had hidden from the KGB. A colleague
joined her inbringing it to light. A careful reporter for the Wall
Street Journal produced in its news pages a persuasive report.
Russian president Boris Yeltsin himself, who gone to school in
Sverdlovsk and who had risen to power as party secretary of its
region, publicly blamed the military. The city itself tore down its
statues of Stalin and voted to revert to its pre-revolutionary
name: Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   Now a definitive account of the affair has appeared _ ``Anthrax:
The Investigation of a Deadly Outbreak'' by Jeanne Guillemin, a
Boston College sociologist who just happens to be married to
Matthew Meselson. It is a masterpiece of investigative journalism
(``shoe-leather epidemiology,'' she would say): part detective
story, part courtroom drama, part history of the Soviet Union, part
meditation on the wickedness of governments.
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful book as well. It contains photographs of the
victims, taken from their headstones in the cemetary where they are
buried, photographs of the heroic pathologists who preserved their
evidence in paraffin for nearly 15 years, photographs of the genial
physicians who served as mouthpieces for the government cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Written in the heroic present, ``Anthrax'' permits us to look
over the shoulders of a team of five investigators, led by
Meselson, who visited Russian in the summer of 1992 in search of
answers. It offers vivid insights into how scientists actually work
_ the ceasless questioning from every conceivable angle view whose
goal is to eliminate doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpieces of the book are a pair of simple statisical
graphics. Near the beginning appears the official Russian version
of what happened: a simple little hand-drawn graph depicting
hospitalzation dates for 96 anthrax victims, 68 of whom died. It
shows a relatively slowly-unfolding outbreak that seems to support
the hypothesis of tainted meat.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the book is the epidemiological map that
perfectly summarizes all of Guillemin and Meselson's
investigations. It shows the daytime locations on Monday, April 2
of the 62 anthrax victims who were identified. They form a nearly
straight line extending five or six kilometers downwind from a
building called Compound 19. ``All the data _ from interviews,
documents, lists, autopsies and wind reports _ now fit like pieces
of a puzzle,'' writes Guillemin. ``What we know proves a lethal
plume of anthrax came from Compound 19.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Why? Guillemin interviews a general who
admits an aerosol chamber existed in Compound 19 big enough to
infect monkeys two at a time (and tiny compared to the
million-liter test chamber used for similar purposes at Fort
Detrick that the Americans called ``the Eight Ball.'') Was
contaminated air from an experiment released into the atmosphere
through a technological malfunction like Chernobyl? Sabotage, like
the incident at Bhopal? We'll never know, says Guillemin. All that
is certain is that the Russian authorities systematically lied
about the event.
</P>
<P>
   As relentlessly as the author seeks to keep the focus of her
book on that which can be proved, inevitably little bits of
personal politics creep in. John Reed, author of ``Ten Days That
Shook The World'' about the Russian Revolution, is her distant
cousin. The T-34 tank is ``the model that saved the Soviet Union
and the world from Nazi Germany.'' (Take that, Winston Churchill!)
Guillemin and Meselson present exactly the sort of respect for
others in positions of authority that you would expect from
committed arms-controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the most powerful passages in the book occurs when
the author describes what happens in the same year as the anthrax
outbreak when a river in western Siberia suddenly changes course
and a exposes the skeletons of thousand victims of a Stalin purge.
The KGB rushes to the riverbank to perform the same sort of damage
control. Cattle bones, they say _ and when nobody believes that,

Meselson have now brought the episode to closure, to a finish, a
fitting end, a conclusion. ``Yellow Rain'' was probably a figment

know. The people who asserted its significance most passionately
have done nothing to resolve the matter. There has been no attempt

 McCAIN FAULTS LANDMARK ABORTION DECISION 
 (rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain Friday criticized the
landmark Supreme Court decision that created a legal right to
abortion as ``overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona Republican, also said that after ``a lot of
study, a lot of consultation and a lot of prayer,'' he had decided
that his opposition to abortion would not extend to cases of rape
and incest.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire on Friday, McCain's campaign began running a
television commercial accusing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas of
breaking his handshake pledge not to run negative advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's position on abortion was not new. He has had a long
anti-abortion voting record. But at a campaign stop at the
Greenville County library, he was called on to discuss abortion and
the related issue of fetal tissue research far more than he usually
does. The subject was raised several times by audience members, who
seemed to be on different sides of the polarizing social issue.
</P>
<P>
   When abortion came up once again at a news conference afterward,
McCain grimaced, as visibly uncomfortable as Bush was when
questioned at length about abortion the day before in Iowa. Both
men are trying to appeal to conservative voters while also
remaining attractive to moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters how he judged the Supreme Court decision of
Roe vs. Wade, which created a legal right to abortion, McCain
called the decision ``flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the library a questioner pressed him on whether he would
countenance abortion under any circumstances and then asked him to
explain the difference between the ``life of a child'' conceived in
rape or incest and one conceived when two high school students
``made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that this is a Talmudic discussion and one that
goes on for hours and hours and hours and hours,'' McCain replied.
``We have to make decisions in life, and we have to balance one
thing against the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a lot of study, a lot of consultation and a lot of
prayer, I came up with a position that I believe there should be an
exception for rape, incest or the life of a mother. And that has to
do with moral beliefs. It has to with overriding concerns. It has
to do with a whole lot of aspects of this issue, which is one of
the most difficult and agonizing issues that I think all of us
face, because of our belief _ yours and mine _ that life begins at
conception.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later in his town hall meeting, a man asked how
Republicans who say they want to get government out of people's
lives rationalize government intervention on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love,'' McCain said, his voice at one point quavering
slightly, ``and I think all of us would like, to have the issue of
abortion not in the political arena. But taxpayers' dollars are
used. Taxpayers. Mine, yours and everybody else's are used in this
issue in a variety of programs that the government sponsors. So
when people who have the fundamental moral belief as I do that life
begins at conception, then we believe that our tax dollars are
being used to take a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on his campaign bus he told reporters that he had voted in
Congress for a ban on fetal tissue research but had changed his
position after he watched Rep. Morris Udall, his friend, die of
Parkinson's disease and had Udall's daughter tell him that such
research might help to find a cure.
</P>
<P>
   In the new 30-second commercial in New Hampshire, McCain stares
straight into a camera and for the first time criticizes Bush
directly in response to Bush's own New Hampshire commercial. The
Bush commercial says that one aspect of McCain's tax cut plan
contains a hidden $40 billion tax increase on benefits that could
hurt working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was bound to happen,'' McCain says smiling. ``Now
my opponent has started the political attacks after promising he
wouldn't. Bush's attacks are wrong. My plan cuts taxes, secures
Social Security and pays down the debt. There is no tax increase.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been running as a different kind of politician,
also says: ``When I began this campaign I promised you something
better _ that I wouldn't engage in attack politics. I'm keeping my
pledge. If you agree with my conservative reform agenda, I'd
appreciate your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was read the text of the McCain advertisement in Grinnell,
Iowa, Thursday and responded: ``I guess my response is that it's
kind of one of the old, tired political tricks. We had a policy
disagreement. He laid out a plan that either doesn't add up or
taxes employee benefits. An honest debate about how we cut taxes is
important for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge and countercharge over tax cuts dominated much of the
Republican race all week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted that his response advertisement was a matter of
political self-defense, not a veiled attack. ``I'm saying that I am
being falsely accused,'' he said. ``If he takes his ad down, we
will take our ad down.''

LACK OF TRAINING FOR DOCTORS LIMITING ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Caroline Mitchell, 26 and a second-year medical student
at Harvard Medical School, isn't quite sure if she wants to
practice in a city or back home in rural Vermont, or if she will
even go into an obstetrics-gynecology residency.
</P>
<P>
   But she does know that she wants her practice to include
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is one of a group of medical students who are committed
to doing something about reduced access to abortion, which was made
legal by the Supreme Court 27 years ago today (Jan. 22). Their
concern comes at a time when there has been a downward trend in
abortions, which may reflect not just a decline in unwanted
pregnancies but also the fact there are fewer hospitals and clinics
providing them. Also, practicing doctors who have performed
abortions have often stopped for a range of reasons, from fear for
their safety to simple retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The students, including Mitchell, have banded together to call
for increased instruction in medical school and residency programs
through a national organization, the 4,000 student-strong Medical
Students for Choice.
</P>
<P>
   This group's advocacy helped spur the Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education to adopt a policy in 1995 that requires
accredited residency programs to provide ``access to experience
with induced abortion,'' while allowing for residents and entire
programs to be exempt from this training for ``religious or moral
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy followed upon a 1992 study showing that just 12
percent of US ob/gyn residencies provide routine training in
first-trimester abortion, and has played a role in the increase of
residency programs that now do so, said a spokeswoman from the
National Abortion Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Reduction in access and in abortions has been steady in the
1990s. Between 1992 and 1996, 338 hospitals and clinics quit
providing abortion services, according to a 1998 study by Alan
Guttmacher Institute. In 1997 (the most recent data), the Centers
for Disease Control said fewer than 1.2 million women had
abortions, the lowest number since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Crittenton Hastings House, which provides
comprehensive women's services and became the first licensed
abortion provider in Massachusetts in 1973, quit providing
abortions earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic closed because of ``declining utilization of the
service, and there are other quality providers to meet the needs,''
spokesman Chip Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Crittenton Hastings provided about 7,000
abortions each year, Gavin said. That dwindled down to 1,600 a year
before it stopped this month.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion like Maryclare Flynn, executive director
of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, said training for the procedure
should not be in medical education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical students are taking on quite a noble profession. It is
only natural for students studying to save life not to spend time
learning something that deliberately stops the human heart,'' said
Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   But Debra Stulberg, who is Mitchell's classmate and wants to be
a family practioner who provides abortions, said that medical
students are so busy that if they are not exposed to it in medical
school, they will not seek out the information they need. ``You
wouldn't tell students that if they want to learn how to remove an
appendix, they should seek it out on their own time,'' Stulberg.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, she feels that abortion must be taught in
medical school because she wants her future fellow doctors to
understand exactly what it is, and how common it is, so they can
counsel women on all the reproductive options, and possibly refer
them to a doctor who will provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Stulberg and her Harvard classmates are working to have an
abortion lecture that is now optional become required. Also,
Mitchell said that at the end of a required lecture on
contraception during pharmacology last year, she asked a question
on medication-induced abortion, even though the lecture did not
touch on it.
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, one of the hospitals
that Harvard students rotate through, observations of abortions are
part of the third-year required rotation, but those with
``religious or moral reasons'' can opt out, hospital spokesman Bill
Schaller said. Also, ob-gyn residents do a 10-week rotation during
which they spend one day a week training in pregnancy termination.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the accreditation panel's policy, University of
Massachusetts Medical School spokesman Mark Shelton said that UMass
now has residents trained in pregnancy termination at the Memorial
hospital campus.

BUSH DISCUSSES HIS STRUGGLE WITH ALCOHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLFAX, Iowa _ Dipping into a subject he rarely raises on the
campaign trail, Texas Governor George W. Bush Friday told a group
of recovering drug addicts that he still identifies with their
struggle, more than a decade after he gave up alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking from a lectern inside a chapel here, told the
young men his Christian faith was critical in shaping his
turnaround. He cast his battle in simple terms, saying: ``Just like
you, I'm on a walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drink too much and I quit drinking. I believe it's
because Billy Graham planted a seed into my heart one time,'' Bush
said. It ``wasn't Billy, he was the messenger. I want you to know
that your life's walk is shared by a lot of other people. Even some
who wear suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in the final days before the Iowa presidential
caucuses on Monday, Bush went to great lengths to evoke images of
his ``prosperity with a purpose'' slogan, visiting four far-flung
cities and shaking hundreds of hands during a solid 14-hour
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled for the cameras, pouring coffee for shopkeepers at a
diner in Grinnell. He did radio interviews from the car, then
exchanged greetings with retirees at a community center in
Marshalltown. Every moment, whether spontaneous or not, was
recorded by the approximately 50 reporters Bush now has in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also addressed the delicate matter of abortion for a second
day in a row. Though he declined to mention it in his speeches,
when asked, Bush said he counts abortion among the dozens of
difficult issues that should be decided by individual states rather
than the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion, was wrong because it ``usurped the power of the
legislatures,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of
what the legislatures should do in America,'' he said when asked
whether he thought the decision should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush refused to say how he felt each state should act.
Instead, he said that when it comes to legalizing abortion, ``it
should be up to each legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Bush's top opponent in Iowa,
immediately pounced on the response, accusing the Texas governor of
masking his weak opposition to abortion with ``verbal gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to show his softer side in Iowa, where social issues
play more prominently than the tax cut dispute central in in New
Hampshire. The first stop Friday was at Teen Challenge, a
residential drug recovery center outside Des Moines, where Bush
heard the life stories of five former addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who advocates letting government rely on religious groups
to handle social issues as part of his ``compassionate
conservative'' plank, praised the center for its mission. But he
also used it as a vehicle to elaborate on his attitude toward the
federal role in administering such programs _ saying, essentially,
that the government should not have any restrictions at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a program that receives no federal or state money, and
I asked the question (of the director), if there was a voucher
attached to that person that's seeking help, would you accept the
voucher?'' Bush told the recovering addicts. ``And (the director)
said yes, under only one condition. No strings. And I agree with
that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he addressed a larger group in the center's chapel. Dressed
in a dark suit, with a matching blue tie with silver stars, Bush
stressed his similarities with the former addicts, telling them,
essentially, that he feels their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's also important for folks to know that a guy
running for president of the United States, I'm on a walk. Just
like you, I'm on a walk, and it's a never-ending walk as far as I'm
concerned,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he was never addicted to alcohol. But since giving
up drinking in 1986, at age 40, he described that as a turning
point in his life.

MCCAIN FOCUSES ON SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Senator John McCain was not in New Hampshire
Friday, a fact made quite clear by more than just sunshine and no
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes into the question-and-answer period of a town hall
meeting at the Greenville County Library _ the first stop on a
two-day trip through the state before he heads north and hunkers
down for the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary _ talk turned to
abortion, religion and the military, and stayed on those topics for
a long while.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has often said that South Carolina, which holds its GOP
primary on Feb. 19, is vital to a successful run for the Republican
nomination for president. Without a good showing here, he has said,
he will have enormous difficulty going much farther.
</P>
<P>
   The state is more conservative than New Hampshire, set as it is
firmly in the Bible belt. And many Republicans here are strongly
opposed to abortion. It is also more densely packed with veterans
than any other and hosts at least 10 large military bases.
``They've practically turned South Carolina into an armed camp,''
McCain quipped.
</P>
<P>
   On the current state of the US military, McCain can talk for
hours, often launching diatribes against the waste and disarray of
today's armed forces. And his comments were well-received Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He has often seemed more uncomfortable discussing his views on
abortion. But Friday, McCain, who is antiabortion, was far more
ready with his opinions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The senator began the meeting, crowded with several hundred
people, with a speech on internet pornography and the need to
filter content on computers in public libraries. But his audience
seemed more concerned with other topics.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked questions on abortion from both directions: One
inquisitor asked how he could be antiabortion and still vote to
support fetal-tissue research. Another asked how he could support
less government involvement in people's lives, yet want to
interfere with a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he thought Roe v. Wade should be overturned and that
he would support exceptions to a ban on abortion in cases of
incest, rape, and when the mother's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   He supports fetal-tissue research, he said, because it has
helped make progress against Parkinson's disease. McCain ended with
his assertion that pro-choice and antiabortion activists should
cooperate on issues of foster care and adoption.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to his beliefs on abortion, he said, ``after a lot
of study, consultation, and a lot of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether his wish to overturn the Supreme
Court on Roe v. Wade flies in the face of the GOP's desire for
smaller government, McCain said the federal government was right to
involve itself, since its money had been used to help fund
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us would like not to have the issue of abortion in the
public arena, but taxpayers' dollars . . . are being used to take a
human life,'' he said. ``That's why we can't get it out of the
public arena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he added, ``I'd like to have less intensity on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of Republican primary voters in South Carolina
will decide on a candidate based on his position on abortion, said
US Representative Mark Sanford, also a state co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, McCain's chief rival for the GOP nomination, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, came under fire from candidate Steve
Forbes for being ``a pro-life pacifist.'' McCain, running a distant
second to Bush nationally, has so far escaped Forbes's wrath. His
positions on abortion do not differ from Bush's,
</P>
<P>
   except that McCain has refused to apply a litmus test to
judicial appointments, and Bush has not made an explicit commitment
either way.

NEW MCCAIN ADS TO FOCUS ON BUSH CAMPAIGN TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain Friday launched a media
campaign accusing Texas Governor George W. Bush of dirty
campaigning as presidential candidates began their push to the New
Hampshire primary finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns said they had no plans to increase their paid
time on-air beyond this week's levels because the airwaves already
are saturated, but all are preparing new commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In both parties, spin artists are saying their candidates are
taking the high road while their opponents are engaging in attacks
and negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, who creates McCain's ads, said that for the final
10 days of the primary race ``our campaign is running a heavy
weight of television, as is Bush,'' but the amount would be about
the same as it has been in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you could buy more, but it would be
foolish of us to do that,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that McCain has only a fraction of the funding
Bush has amassed, and ``we have to husband our resources,'' Stevens
said. But in addition, he said, ``to be effective you don't need
more than we're doing right now. There is so much, at some point it
kind of drowns itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain television and radio ads that started running Friday
accuse Bush of knowingly speaking untruthfully about McCain's tax
proposal to manipulate the debate between the Republican
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in a telephone interview that the spots were made in
response to charges Bush began airing Tuesday accusing McCain of
planning to tax employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not true and I had to say it is not true,'' McCain said.
``I said it as politely as I can.. . . I have learned over the
years that you have to respond if (an opponent's claim) is not
factual. You can't just allow it to sit out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Spaulding, McCain's New Hampshire chairman, and Michael
Dennehy, his Northeast political director, said in interviews that
Bush is lying about McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   They said the damage perceived to have been done to Bill
Bradley's Democratic campaign because the former New Jersey senator
has not responded to attacks from Vice President Al Gore also was
taken into account in the decision to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a statement released in Austin, Texas, said McCain was
using ``one of the oldest tricks in the book,'' portraying ``an
honest debate about how to cut taxes'' as an attack that violates
the two men's agreement not to campaign negatively.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ad, McCain, perched on a desktop and smiling
ruefully, says: ``I guess it was bound to happen. Now my opponent
has started the political attacks after promising he wouldn't. Mr.
Bush's attacks are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He then talks about his plans for use of the national surplus to
cut taxes, shore up Social Security, and reduce the national debt _
the plans he says Bush is knowingly speaking untruthfully about.
``When I began this campaign, I promised you something better _
that I wouldn't engage in attack politics,'' McCain says. ``I'm
keeping my pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also released a new ad Friday, featuring Senator Judd Gregg
of New Hampshire endorsing the governor and implicitly criticizing
McCain by saying, ``Some say Bush's plan to cut taxes is too much.
They believe if you leave money in Washington it will not get
spent. We know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon of Maverick Media in Austin, who makes Bush's
commercials, said the campaign had ``a couple'' of new ads in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be closing out the last week with positive-focused
messages summarizing our message and campaign,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, was slightly more
forthcoming about a new ad scheduled for release by the Gore
campaign Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said more than one new ad was in the works, and ``these are
extremely extremely positive in tone and content.'' He left open
the door for further criticisms of Bradley, however, saying ``we
have never been reticent about comparing Al Gore's approach to
Senator Bradley's approach of health care and the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Gore campaign would buy advertising over the next 10
days at about the same pace as over the last 10; McKinnon said the
same regarding Bush ad buys.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, the head of publisher Steve Forbes' campaign,
would not say how many commercials were in the works or on what
subjects. ``We'll let Bush find out when they appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col hinted that his campaign might significantly increase
its buys of air time, saying, ``There's always the possibility of
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' ads, some of which have been the most sharply negative
of the campaign so far, ``will obviously be issue-oriented and
mixed with what we have now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign did not respond to repeated calls to its
New Hampshire and New Jersey offices requesting information about
its final New Hampshire push.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of what to expect might be afforded by two commercials
Bradley released just before the Iowa caucuses. One shows an
animated, gesticulative Bradley promising to say what's on his mind
without regard to the polls. The other features Boston Celtics
great Bill Russell endorsing Bradley and good-naturedly urging
citizens to vote.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American companies are reporting a surge in profits, giving
investors reason to hope that the aging bull market may have more
life left.
</P>
<P>
   With companies from Warner-Lambert to America Online turning in
strong results, overall earnings growth for the Standard and Poor's
500 is on track to exceed 17 percent in 1999. The trend accelerated
in the second half of the year. Earnings rose more than 22 percent
in the third quarter and are now looking up about 21 percent in the
fourth, although many companies have not yet reported.
</P>
<P>
   That growth rate is three times the long-term average of 7
percent, and a sharp increase from 1998, when earnings barely rose
in large part because of the Asian financial crisis and the General
Motors strike. Furthermore, fourth-quarter results have handily
surpassed the expectations of industry analysts on Wall Street,
indicating a stronger economy than expected just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those same industry analysts are projecting 17 percent growth in
earnings in 2000, said Charles Hill, director of research for First
Call, which tracks analyst estimates. ``I think the die is cast
through at least the first half of 2000 that we're going to get
good earnings reports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, who are increasingly nervous about lofty stock
prices and rising interest rates, the earnings growth provides
reason for optimism. Although even bullish stock market strategists
say that rising interest rates may well crimp stocks for the next
couple of months, stocks track corporate earnings over the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, ``you've got the classic tug-of-war with
worries over rising rates against better-than-expected earnings,''
said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Lehman
Brothers. ``But basically at the end of the road, you've got a very
strong set of fundamentals that leads to a bull market that is now
10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, who for the last five years has been one of Wall
Street's most consistently bullish _ and correct _ strategists,
remains a bull. He says stocks should turn in double-digit
percentage gains for the year, although there could be a sharp
selloff along the way because of interest rate fears.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are considered bad for stocks, because
they raise the cost of doing business and depress corporate
earnings and because higher yields make bonds relatively more
attractive than stocks to investors. As the rate on the 30-year
Treasury bond has risen from less than 5 percent in 1998 to 6.7
percent currently, the gap between bond yields and stock prices has
loomed ever larger. Stocks are trading at historically high
multiples of earnings, with the S&AMP;P 500 now selling for 25 times
its estimated 2000 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, investing one dollar in a Treasury bond
guarantees a return of almost seven cents next year, while
investing one dollar in the stock market buys only four cents of
earnings. Of course, the stocks could appreciate far more, but
generally speaking, stock investors are buying a stream of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the earnings stream on bonds and stocks have been
roughly comparable. When they diverge, investors generally see
opportunity in the cheaper asset, which in this case is bonds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors are staying in stocks, counting on future
earnings growth to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with technology
companies, the relationship between earnings growth and valuations
is even more striking. After gaining 86 percent last year, the
Nasdaq stock basket trades at 125 times its companies' earnings of
the last 12 months, according to Joseph Abbott, senior equity
strategist at I/B/E/S International.
</P>
<P>
   That level is roughly eight times the historical average,
leading some investors to worry that the United States is in a
Japan-like stock market bubble. Japan's stock market roared ahead
in the 1980s, fueled by a real estate frenzy and a belief that
Japanese companies were far ahead of their foreign competitors,
before crashing in 1990 as interest rates rose. A decade later, the
stock market remains 50 percent off its 1989 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nasdaq composite is extremely expensive, its
companies are expected to grow 63 percent in 2000, about nine times
the average growth in corporate earnings for the last 50 years
recorded by First Call. Strong productivity increases, fast
economic growth in the United States and massive investments in
technology are driving the increase, said Robert Froehlich, chief
investment strategist at Kemper Funds, which manages $40 billion in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unbelievable amount of pent-up demand for
technology,'' Froehlich said. ``In addition, productivity is
increasing, and that's not going to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength in earnings sweeps across almost every sector of
the economy, said Hill of First Call. Helped by high oil prices,
energy companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings about double
their 1998 levels. Financial companies are showing gains of roughly
30 percent, while technology companies, which were expected to be
slowed as big customers cut spending in the fall because of fears
of yearend computer problems, are reporting gains of 20 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott of I/B/E/S said he was particularly impressed that fewer
companies than usual had warned of earnings disappointments for the
fourth quarter, while more companies had surpassed analysts'
estimates. Although some major companies, notably Lucent
Technologies, came in far short of expectations, the overall number
of negative announcements was the lowest in the five years that
I/B/E/S has tracked quarterly warnings, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Another especially promising sign is the amount by which
companies have exceeded analysts' expectations for the fourth
quarter. Companies often guide Wall Street analysts to slightly
lower profits than their internal expectations. As a result,
companies typically report earnings gains that surpass analysts'
estimates by about 3 percent, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, corporate results so far have been 7
percent ahead of expectations, Hill said. ``It's clear we're going
to beat the numbers by more than we normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some strategists remain wary that high interest rates may
derail the stock market. Christine Callies, chief U.S. market
strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, predicts that the Federal
Reserve will continue to raise short-term rates until stocks fall
because the Fed is very concerned that market gains have led
consumers to increase spending unsustainably and overheat the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some investors are worried that companies are
pumping up their earnings by taking some profits on successful
venture capital investments. Intel, Microsoft and other technology
companies recorded big profits from such investments in the fourth
quarter, as did Chase Manhattan and some other non-technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Applegate of Lehman played down that concern. Other
strategies that companies have used to bolster earnings, like
lumping many expenses into one-time charges, have largely
disappeared over the last couple of years after regulators clamped
down, he said.

   MIAMI _ There were tears, pleas and angry words Friday as the
two Cuban grandmothers of 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez came to
the United States in a bid to bring their grandson home.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic trip organized by church leaders who hoped they

stand-off over the boy continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come so we can end this great tragedy ... so you'll let us
take our grandson back to Cuba as soon as possible to our home,''
Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said at a news
conference shortly after arriving at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have requested a meeting with U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno, who Justice Department officials said Friday is
seriously considering the request. No final decision had yet been
made on holding the meeting, the officials said, although they
added that it could take place as early as Saturday in Washington
at Reno's office.
</P>
<P>
   But Quintana made it clear the two women have no plans to travel
to Miami to visit Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about going to the house,'' she said. ``They
have no right to keep the child there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's relatives watched the news conference in the
Little Havana home where the boy has stayed since he was rescued at
sea on Thanksgiving Day. Elian looked briefly at the television set
as his grandmothers spoke, but then went back to playing with his
toys, the family told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that while they would welcome the grandmothers
into their home, they would not take the boy to meet them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``I
want them to see how comfortable he is in this house and how much
love and attention he gets. And I have a lot of questions in my
mind for them. I haven't seen a tear from her eyes asking about her
daughter,'' she said, referring to Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, whose daughter _ Elian's mother _ drowned on
the ill-fated voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments in the saga surrounding the boy seemed
to indicate that it might be weeks or longer before a resolution to
the tense stand-off is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to
overturn a decision by U.S. immigration officials to send the boy
back to his father in Cuba. On Friday, the judge initially assigned
to the case, U.S. District Judge James L. King, stepped aside. King
cited several possible conflicts, including his crowded trial
schedule and connections between his son, a Miami-Dade County
judge, and a spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and Attorney General
Janet Reno, named as defendants in the case, are expected to file a
response to the Miami family's complaint on Monday, perhaps
clearing the way for the legal proceedings to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the grandmothers seemed likely to have little
bearing on the legal case, although some observers speculated that
attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives might attempt to subpoena the
women to make them testify in court.
</P>
<P>
   In another upcoming twist in the case, several members of
Congress have promised to introduce bills when they convene on
Monday to grant Elian U.S. citizenship or permanent residency,
which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   For the weekend, however, it appeared the massive media
attention on the case would focus on the two grandmothers. The
women are expected to stay in this country for only a few days,
said a spokesman for the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant church group favors returning the boy to Cuba,
and chartered the jet to bring the grandmothers to New York. They
did not go to Miami out of fears over the explosive atmosphere
here, where Cuban exiles have vowed to form a human chain to keep
the boy in this country, said group spokesman Robert Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   After the women's news conference, Jorge Mas Santos, head of the
powerful Cuban American National Foundation, said Miami's exiles
would warmly welcome the grandmothers here.
</P>
<P>
   But he also blasted their remarks, which he labeled a
``charade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself why these two grandmothers aren't here in Miami
to hug and hold their grandson,'' he said. ``Instead they are in
New York repeating the propaganda of Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   In their news conference, the women sidestepped the question of
why Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, didn't join them on their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need to be here because that is what the
grandmothers are here for,'' said Rodriguez. Elian's father has
said he would never come to this country, partly because he fears
he would be a target for Cuban exile extremists and because he
believes his son should be returned without such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers' immediate plans remained unclear. There were
reports they would meet with members of Congress from New York who
favor returning Elian to Cuba, and that they might visit
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear was that little Elian will likely remain at the
center of the dizzying media swirl and angry tug-of-war that has
surrounded him now for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you and beg you ... to do everything possible so the boy
will be given to us so my daughter can rest in peace,'' said
Rodriguez.

BUSH SPOKESMAN SEES THREAT TO CHARITIES IN MCCAIN TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain's tax plan could cause
charities, universities and art museums to lose as much as $9
billion over five years, the Bush campaign charged Friday in the
escalating Republican primary fight over taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, anything that would take money away from a charity is
either a mistake or a step in the wrong direction,'' said Ari
Fleischer, spokesman for Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's plan, people who give charitable
contributions in the form of stock, real estate, bonds or art work
would no longer be able to take a tax deduction for the current,
appreciated value of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the donor could take a deduction only for the original
cost of the asset. The McCain campaign describes this as closing a
loophole for the very rich, while the Bush campaign says it would
kill off incentives for giving.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are a popular gift for giving. For example, 30 percent of
the $452 million worth of gifts to Harvard University last year
came in the form of stocks, said Andrew Tiedemann, director of
communications for the Harvard development office.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says that in 1996, 32 million
taxpayers claimed $86 billion in deductions for charitable
contributions, reducing federal revenue by about $22 billion.
Limiting that tax deduction would raise revenues by about $9.1
billion over five years, or $17.6 billion over 10 years, the CBO
said in an analysis in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of colleges, universities, philanthropic
organizations and other charities reacted sharply Friday as the
Bush campaign spread word of the McCain provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire charitable community would be outraged by anything
like that,'' said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the
American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 colleges and
universities. Steinbach said he reviewed the McCain language and
agrees with the Bush campaign's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would significantly reduce the incentive for a lot of
people to contribute to charitable institutions,'' said Matthew
Hamill, vice president for public policy at Independent Sector,
representing 750 charities, foundations and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials said the senator has always favored
tax deductions for gifts to charity. And they did not disagree with
what the tax provision actually does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealthy Americans shouldn't get a tax write-off for
contributing a fancy painting or an overvalued stock while middle
class Americans are in need of a tax cut,'' said Howard Opinsky,
McCain's spokesman. ``It's just another example of Governor Bush
protecting his wealthy donor base at the expense of the middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said that by eliminating the deduction, McCain's plan
would give 25,000 additional working-class people a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Koch, McCain's policy adviser, said many wealthy people
are writing off highly valued assets on a gain they have never
taken or paid taxes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to value property, such as works of art,'' said
Koch. ``You can end up with highly inflated values for donated
objects.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and McCain fight for support in New Hampshire, they have
each complained heatedly about the other's tax plan. Saturday
Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and
Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican, are expected to
dissect McCain's tax plan during a news conference in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   McCain proposes cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
He says it is irresponsible to cut taxes further until the
financial future of Social Security and Medicare is assured. He
would also use money from the surplus to pay down the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, would give a five-year, $483 billion
tax cut. He says the only way to ensure that the federal government
does not spend any budget surplus is to refund most of the money to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   With little time remaining until the Feb. 1 primary, the Bush
campaign is intent on picking apart McCain's plan. They have also
accused McCain of raising taxes by $40 billion by eliminating the
tax deduction for employer-provided benefits, such as life
insurance, tuition, parking and fitness memberships. McCain,
however, has said he would deprive corporations from getting a tax
deduction for club memberships and free parking, but not for health
insurance premiums or tuition assistance.

<P>
   MIAMI _ There were tears, pleas and angry words Friday as the
two Cuban grandmothers of 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez came to
the United States in a bid to bring their grandson home.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic trip organized by church leaders who hoped they
might reunite a family fractured by political differences appeared
instead to spark a new round of rhetoric and posturing as the icy

HERE'S INSTANT ACCESS TO YOUR SECRETS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: If I use AOL Instant Messenger at work, is
there any record of my ``conversations'' on its server? Also, if I
check my home e-mail through a mail viewer on my work computer, is
there a record? _ Guilty Conscience
</P>
<P>
   Dear Guilty: OK, for the last time, never do any personal stuff
at work. Nobody's accusing you of carrying on a lurid, seamy,
disgusting online romance _ although I briefly had an interesting
fantasy about that _ but you shouldn't take the chance that your
boss is a prying weasel with no regard for your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have any. You're working on company equipment,
using company software, doing company business. Your letter to
HotPants202 is company property if you sent it from the office.
Your instant messages belong to the company, too.
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that most companies trust employees not to abuse
Internet access. Sure, everyone takes a quick surf to sites that
have nothing to do with business. Even I occasionally check the
lowest fares to Las Vegas, although I consider that to be
journalistic research in case I ever need to answer a question
about probability theory. Just be aware that the technology exists
to record your every keystroke and that any site you visit on the
Internet can be logged by a boss who really wants to.
</P>
<P>
   I was serious about that research. Honest. I even took notes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: When I send pictures via Outlook Express, all
the recipients get is a jumble of text. _ Picture Imperfect
</P>
<P>
   Dear Imperfect: Wouldn't it be nice if everybody in the world
had the same e-mail program and used the same type of computer? Of
course, pigs will be airborne long before that ever happens,
especially with the way things are shaping up for the guys at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook Express has a nice little feature that lets senders
embed pictures directly in a letter. Of course, you need a
compatible e-mail program to actually see the picture on the
receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   To send anything more complex than plain text, e-mail programs
convert files into strings of letters and numbers that represent
all the different bytes that make up your picture of Junior
drooling in his oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   While not all programs understand embedded pictures, most of
them can handle attached files. Pick ``File attachment'' instead of
``Picture'' from the Insert menu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My aunt's e-mail service carrier is Microsoft's
Hotmail, which she uses for a business. However, for the past six
weeks, she has not been able to access any e-mail. _ Not So Hot
</P>
<P>
   Dear Hot: At least you're getting a level of service
proportional to what you're paying: nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail and all those other ``free'' e-mail services are fine
for many things. They let you check mail from any computer
connected to the Internet. They let you hide behind a flashy
nickname when you request information on Viagra. They even let you
receive mail from your regular Internet provider while you're on
the road. I'd never bet the business on a freebie mail account,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Your aunt's Internet provider should have its own mail server,
and if it doesn't, it's time to open the Yellow Pages. Remember,
nobody can force you to stay with a provider that doesn't give you
good service unless you sign a long-term contract. Did I mention
that you should never sign a long-term contract? &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Dr. Emilio Bombay's editors continue to curse the day they signed
him to a long-term contract. E-mail him at

FEW PARDONS ISSUED DURING BUSH'S TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For nearly three decades, Huntsville attorney
Bill Habern has represented Texans seeking pardons for past crimes.
But since Gov. George W. Bush has taken office, Habern tells most
of his clients not to waste his time or their money.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor has set a modern-day low record for the
number of pardons issued _ 16 since taking office in 1995, none in
the last two years _ and Habern doesn't expect any new ones anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardons are not easily obtained in this state and they're less
easily obtained in the Bush administration _ particularly while
he's running for president,'' said Habern, a Democrat. ``He's not
going to have Willie Horton grab his leg while he's on the way the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton, a Massachusetts convict who raped a woman while on
furlough, became the subject of controversial but effective ads
against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1988. Dukakis, whose
running mate was Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, lost the presidential
race to then-Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview last month with the Star-Telegram, Gov.
Bush, the frontrunning GOP presidential candidate, said his low
number of pardons comes not from political calculation but from
issuing a pardon in his first year of office that he later came to
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pardoned Steven Raney in 1995 for a 1988 marijuana
conviction. A few months after being released, the unpaid Ellis
County constable was caught stealing cocaine from a drug bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused a complete review of the process,'' said Bush. ``I
have nothing against pardoning. I just haven't been very aggressive
on it. There's no philosophical reason. It's just that it kind of
slowed us down initially. I said, `Whoa!,' because it was a pretty
rough story.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 16 pardons compares with 70 issued by his immediate
predecessor, Democrat Ann Richards; 822 by Republican Bill Clements
(in two separate terms between 1978 and 1987); and 1,048 by
then-Democrat John Connally, who served from 1963-1969, state
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   The last governor with fewer than 16 pardons was Gov. Coke
Stevenson, who issued six between 1941 and 1947, according to state
records.
</P>
<P>
   While some have been critical of Bush's cautious approach to
pardons, victims rights advocates tend to be supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of accepting responsibility for your
actions,'' said Rusty Hubbarth, who oversees legislative issues for
the crime victims' group Justice for All. ``There's no such thing
as a get out of jail free card, or get out of stigma free card. If
they don't meet the state criteria they don't get a pardon, that's
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive pardon is one of the most powerful tools at a
governor's _ or president's _ command. It essentially wipes out a
conviction and restores a person's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   As with death penalty commutations, the governor can only grant
a pardon after it has been requested by the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   According to state figures, the board _ appointed by the
governor _ has recommended that 118 people receive pardons since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has granted 16 and refused about 350 _ a number that
includes requests pending from the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are roughly three dozen recommendations from
the board that have not been acted on one way or the other. Austin
defense attorney Gary Cohen, who specializes in pardon and parole
matters, criticized Bush's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that if the Bush-appointed board recommended
pardons, ``those are some truly unique individuals that deserve our
executive officer making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really an abdication of leadership and
responsibility not to exercise the powers that are vested in him,''
Cohen said. ``If he wanted to grant them, that would be great. If
he wanted to deny him, I think that's his call. But to avoid
acting, I think, is inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Linda Edwards said Bush is considering the
recommendations and will act once determinations are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has acted on hundreds of pardon recommendations,
including more than 200 he inherited from Gov. Richards. There are
a few dozen remaining that we are working on,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said the overwhelming majority of the cases in
which pardons were recommended were misdemeanors, many of them
stemming from drug offenses in the 1970's or 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pardons Bush has issued were for petty crimes
committed years ago. Janie Burrell, for example, was convicted of
stealing a Christmas wreath off the front door of a home in her
Jasper neighborhood in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could probably relate to the woman's plight, since he had
gotten caught stealing a Christmas wreath as a college student
while playing a fraternity prank in the 1960s. His misdemeanor
charge was later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell declined an interview, but did say ``it took a long
time,'' to get the pardon.

GUN TRADE GROUP OFFICIAL IN SPOTLIGHT AS HIS INDUSTRY COMES UNDER
FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Nev.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ For nearly 31 years, Robert Delfay received as
little attention as the trade association he worked for, the
National Shooting Sports Federation, a group that devoted most of
its time to promoting the pleasures of hunting and target-shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first day of the federation's annual trade show here
was ending Monday, Delfay had gained a new _ if unsought _
prominence. As federation members began filing into an auditorium
to hear him assess the state of the outdoor sports industry, many
sought him out to thank him and wish him continued good luck. The
speech he delivered moments later made clear why.
</P>
<P>
   In what he later described as his most important address in 31
years with the federation, Delfay explained how this diverse group
of entrepreneurs, whose products make hunting and shooting a
favorite sport of 26 million Americans, had moved front and center
into America's gun wars. No longer an apolitical trade group, it
was now a rising voice against gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sea change,'' he said in a quiet office off the
exhibition floors in the Sands Convention Center a few days later,
groping for a description that adequately conveyed the federation's
passage. ``It marked a definite new era for the organization, a
definite new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the transformation, Delfay, 52, has moved firmly into
public view as the newest face of guns in America, alongside Wayne
LaPierre, , the leading spokesman for gun rights as the loved or
loathed executive director of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Less polished and experienced in public than LaPierre, Delfay is
still finding his voice, selecting words and forming thoughts
carefully for public consumption. But the demand for his voice is
growing, and as he pointed out almost ruefully, the telephone call
that wakes him late at night is now more likely to be ABC News than
Field and Stream magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to know the number of schools in the United States,
junior highs, private schools, junior colleges, even average class
sizes,'' he said, recalling simpler times, when his chief
responsibility was promoting the safe use of firearms and the joys
of shooting sports _ which is to say, 16 months ago. One of his
proudest moments, he said, was drafting a resolution that Congress
approved to create a `'National Hunting and Fishing Day.''
</P>
<P>
   His sudden change in emphasis began last year when cities and
counties began suing gun makers to recoup the costs of gun
violence, putting the survival of some companies at risk. Then the
Department of Housing and Urban Development threw some federal
weight into the fight, threatening a larger suit if the gun makers
did not agree to make guns that were somehow safer than the ones
they made now.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers make up only a third of the members of the
federation, which is based in Newtown, Conn. (others make
camouflage hunting suits and other gear), and the lawsuits were
unexpected. But they turned Delfay's professional life inside out,
forcing him to set aside other projects and resign from several
boards, including that of the U.S. Olympic Shooting Team.
</P>
<P>
   Now coordinating legal strategies and leading the federation's
efforts to establish a political action committee, his life is a
constant blur of meetings with lawyers, municipal leaders, state
attorneys general, members of Congress and White House officials.
He even has to wear a suit and tie now, for goodness' sake. ``We've
always had a casual-dress policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More problematical, he said, was his frustration over a growing
public perception that gun makers are ``merchants of death'' rather
than part of a $6 billion sporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As daunting as his new challenges seem, they became a seamless
extension of a love for shooting that began long ago. As a boy
growing up in Brewster, N.Y., Delfay was introduced to outdoor
pursuits by an uncle, Bob Taylor, his mother's brother-in-law, who
became a surrogate father after his own father deserted the family.
The relationship with Uncle Bob also bolstered his sense of
responsibility, which led to a part-time job he held for 10 years,
working on a dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I milked cows and did everything, you name it,'' Delfay said.
``On my first resume I put down that I single-handedly operated 100
head of cows for 10 days when I was 13 when the owners went on
vacation. I was very proud of that.'' Even a biography provided by
the shooting federation includes the fact that Delfay was a
``farm-hand extraordinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following college at Western Connecticut State University in
Danbury, and a brief stint as a sports reporter there, Delfay
joined the shooting federation as a writer in 1969. He served later
as director of public relations and executive director before
becoming president and chief executive in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers of the gun lawsuits might see resemblances
between his dairy days and now. The makers of guns and ammunition
make very different kinds of guns for very different purposes and
do not always agree, which requires a certain degree of herding for
common purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In the gun wars, for example, Delfay learned, in preparing for
meetings with municipal leaders, that some gun manufacturers would
be more inclined to settle the lawsuits than others. But he is not
certain of even the outlines of a settlement. All sides agree that
the goal is to reducing gun violence and especially children's
access to firearms. But how? More laws? Smart guns? Education? All
of the above?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe none of the above. His brief foray into politics has
quickly convinced him of something the NRA would say, that some of
his opponents might not even want a settlement, only the chance to
cement their political base by screaming at the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is elusive,'' he said before getting to the core of
the problem, as he sees it: ``They want `safer' guns. But guns are
perfectly safe when used as designed or intended. That's the
message we have to get out.''

WITH HELP FROM DEMOCRATS, BUSH MANAGED A COUP ON ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories, REPUBS-CONSERVATIVES, MCCAIN-ABORTION) 
(lh) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Maybe the most surprising thing George W.
Bush accomplished last year had nothing to do with fund raising. He
got Texas Democrats to pass an abortion bill that they had opposed
for decades _ a bill that helped him mollify the Christian right in
his state.
</P>
<P>
   And more than one Democrat seems to have pitched in expressly
for the good of the governor's political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help him and his presidential aspirations because
I just like him,'' said one House Democrat, who like others was
happy to help but unwilling to be be named in print.
</P>
<P>
   In this last week leading up to the Iowa caucuses, Bush is being
challenged on the abortion issue on a whole new level. The
governor's Republican rivals have spent a lot of time trying to
out-do each other in branding him as only a half-hearted opponent
of abortion rights _ ``a pro-life pacifist,'' as Steve Forbes put
it.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush answered a reporter's question here about how he would
respond to a friend who had been raped and was considering an
abortion by saying, ``It's up to her,'' his opponents said the
remark had confirmed their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In answering the critics, Bush pointed to his record in his home
state and specifically to his work on passing a parental
notification bill.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, the governor's real coup on the abortion front
seems to have been in keeping his true feelings on the issue enough
of a mystery to convince both sides that, in his heart of hearts,
he agrees with them. That he has been able to do this even on
abortion _ the hottest hot-button issue there is _ provides clear
proof of his political skills.
</P>
<P>
   Because Democrats control the Texas House, the parental
notification bill that was passed last May could not have become
law, or even come to a vote, without them. It was the governor,
though, who pushed the measure, which requires doctors to notify
the parents of minors seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very high on his agenda,'' said Rep. Patricia Gray,
D-Galveston, who proposed an alternative bill that would have
allowed girls to notify relatives other than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted a really tough bill that would satisfy those folks
on the right,'' Ms. Gray said, ``and now we have the toughest
notification bill in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's efforts dramatically buffed his image with the
religious right in Texas, a crowd that had never been sure he had
its best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   He got the job done, however, by trading on personal
relationships with Democrats. He also was willing to reward
Democrats for their cooperation on a number of legislative matters,
and he let it be known early on that he would not campaign against
friendly lawmakers in the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a bipartisan way to further what look like partisan
goals has left open the debate about Bush's true motives. Were his
efforts on parental notification designed to reward the religious
right, as the social conservatives see it? Or were his efforts
ultimately supposed to rein them in, by throwing conservatives a
fairly meaningless political bone, as many of those who support
abortion rights believe?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, the head of Texas Right to Life, gushes that the
governor has played the other side for suckers _ ``pulled the wool
over their eyes,'' _ and given the Right to Life movement a
much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has mastered the skill of being able to dig in and yet do
it in a way that minimizes the fallout from people who are
pro-choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through some bad times, with Operation Rescue and some
people on the fringe, being associated with people in front of an
abortion clinic with policemen on horseback and barking dogs. But
just through his manner, he's put forth a good image for the
pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, typically see Republicans as the
true patsies _ in their view, getting nothing more from Bush than a
pat on the head _ while he winks at them over conservatives'
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   As one Texas Democrat who has worked for Planned Parenthood
said, ``Bush had to have a parental notification bill to placate
the religious right and wave at people in New Hampshire and South
Carolina, but he isn't strongly anti-abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But with passage of the bill, Bush ``has done more to actually
reduce the number of abortions in Texas than all of the guys who
are climbing a hill, waving a white flag and declaring, `I'm the
most pure on this,''' Price said. ``I'm sure he paid a price.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush smiled when asked if he had in fact spent
a lot of political capital on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did,'' he said, ``I earned a lot more by having spent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray said many Democrats had been charmed by the governor on
this and a variety of other matters: ``It is very difficult for
anybody to resist when he comes in,'' she said. ``And he's
wonderful when you have a constituent you want him to be pleasant
to. It's like that constituent is the only one in the room, and
it's him and that constituent against the world. Heck, I like the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's work on the parental notification bill suggests
that he is able to communicate an almost Clintonian empathy even to
those he is actively working against _ and to make the whole
question of who won or lost any given legislative skirmish a matter
of interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cryer, who worked for the previous governor, Ann Richards,
a Democrat, said parental notification ``was a big loss for us, the
first time in decades that the legislature had passed any bill
restricting the right of a woman to get an abortion, and it could
not have happened under Ann Richards. But it's also a
nothing-burger in a lot of ways. It's notification, not consent. It
clearly had to be given to the religious coalitions, but what it
gave them wasn't strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say that they went along for a variety of reasons: The
bill was overwhelmingly supported by voters. They were tired of
fighting over what was a pretty tepid piece of legislation. And
they had always been supportive of parental rights in this
conservative state. When Republicans gained a one-vote majority in
the state senate in 1997, it seemed only a matter of time before
the bill would pass, they said, and reforms last year made it
harder to block the bill on technicalities, as they had in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, at least some of the Democrats' willingness to go
along with the governor should be chalked up to self-preservation;
With Republicans here picking up strength consistently through the
'80s and '90s, it's now hard for Texas Democrats to be tough on
much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature is set up to function in a bipartisan way,
and the fear of alienating a potential president seems to have,
increasingly, made cooperation an economic issue for Texans, with
few Democrats speaking openly against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they'll have a job in Washington if he wins,''
said Samantha Smoot, executive director of the Texas Freedom
Network, a liberal watchdog group that monitors the Christian
Coalition and similar groups. Even Democrats think that? She
laughed. ``Even reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Texas boosterism also seems to be an underestimated factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going parochial this year, and I'm going to vote for
what's best for Texas, said a retired former state legislator, A.R.
``Babe'' Schwartz, who describes himself as a ``lifetime, yellow
dog, brass collar radical Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush didn't dispute the notion that he had not
exactly worn any holes in his boots stumping for Republicans
against his friends in the other party.
</P>
<P>
   So in a sense, then, the question about whether Bush would, if
necessary, sacrifice Republican lawmakers has been answered: He
already has.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for several reasons, this does not necessarily mean Bush is
likely to sell out congressional Republicans or their agenda if he
is elected.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ms. Gray says that he did campaign against her and
at least a few other Democrats who had cooperated with him. ``We
had worked well with him and had been told the favor would be
repaid, yet he came into my district with his arm around my
opponent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hard to imagine Bush cozying up to congressional
Democrats in quite the same way that he has to the populist Texas
speaker, Pete Laney, or to the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, whom the
governor hugged before he embraced his own father at his second
inaugural.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is a state where what's left of the Democratic Party
competes with Republicans in the strength of its support for the
death penalty and gun owners' rights. Texas Democrats have a lot in
common with Bush, and they increasingly need to prove it to stay in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats say Bush began pestering them about parental
notification in 1997, and in at least some cases he made it clear
that he needed their help with conservatives because he had a
presidential run in view. They found him impossible to resist in
1999, when the bill finally passed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over what the bill means continues, Bush is not
the only one whose motivations remain open to interpretation. When
Texas Democrats are asked what Bush would do for them in terms of
policy if he were elected president, they invariably respond by
suggesting that personal interests may trump policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Al Gore. I've seen him one time,'' said one
Democratic officeholder. ``The governor I can get on the phone any
time I want.''

<P>
   For the insurance companies of America, the sluggish cash cows
of the financial world, the new century is dawning with a jarring
Darwinian message: Either buy up your rivals or risk being
swallowed yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Congress has done away with Depression-era barriers
that fenced off banking, insurance and securities underwriting as
separate businesses, almost everyone in the field, from giant
American banks and brokerage houses to the financial powers of
Europe, is looking for merger partners or takeover targets in a
scramble to get bigger, chasing the dream of greater market share
and, through economies of scale, greater profits.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination now seems possible. But the insurance companies,
with their huge stores of investable cash reserves, battalions of
agents and flocks of customers, are seen as the choicest prizes.
Because of their lumbering performance and relatively small size,
they are particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting down to the eaters and the eatees,'' said David
F. D'Alessandro, president and chief operations officer of the John
Hancock Mutual Insurance Co. in Boston. ``I go to industry meetings
and I see everyone eyeing everyone else, thinking, `What would it
be like to work for that guy? Would I want him working for me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like several of its biggest rivals, John Hancock is racing to
throw off a crucial handicap: its mutual structure. On Thursday,
Hancock will go public, converting from a company owned by
policyholders to one owned by its stockholders. A few weeks later,
Metropolitan Life plans to go public, and Prudential is also
working on a conversion expected for later this year or early in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The executives who run these giant mutual insurers see
conversion to stock ownership as crucial for their continued
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Without stock to use in mergers and takeovers, or options to
attract and reward vital executives, companies with a mutual
structure are seen as increasingly powerless to compete in a new
financial services arena without boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the offerings are not likely to excite investors the way
initial public offerings usually do. Even with John Hancock's
vaunted brand name, the company's shares are expected to open near
book value and languish there, and Met Life can expect a similar
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, once the offering is complete, D'Alessandro, who will
become chief executive of John Hancock in June, is expected to dive
into the thick of the buying as he tries to bulk up his company as
a defense against takeover from the banks and other bigger, richer
players.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Metropolitan Life will be forced into the same sort
of defensive strategy, gobbling up whatever companies it can to
increase earnings and keep the other big fish from getting their
jaws around it.
</P>
<P>
   In such a headlong race for size, deals are being contemplated
that may not be perfect fits and may not even follow good economic
logic, at least for the companies: Naturally, creating
megacorporations means more money and power for the people making
the moves.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is still lacking that what America wants most is
one-stop shopping on financial matters, the rationale behind many
suggested bank-insurer and broker-insurer combinations. Most past
efforts to construct financial services ``supermarkets,'' notably
by American Express and by Sears, Roebuck, did not last long.
</P>
<P>
   But one company seems to be pulling it off, attracting would-be
emulators from all points of the compass: the melding of banking,
insurance and brokerage services under the banner of Citigroup. The
creation of Citigroup has made its co-chief executive and one of
its principal architects, Sanford I. Weill, the toast of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at Sandy Weill and goes, `I want to be him,'''
said Alice Schroeder, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., ``Frankly,''
she said, ``being the CEO of a great big huge company is more
important than being the CEO of a smaller company. And you get paid
more. You might even get your picture on a magazine cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale consolidation of insurance and other financial
businesses will be much less fun for those on lower rungs of the
ladder. For one thing, thousands of jobs will be destroyed. Indeed,
a driving force in taking over an insurance company is the buyer's
conviction that it can be operated more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to run the back offices of both companies with
roughly the staff of one, while piling on more sales people, more
customers and more investment capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the track record of banking mergers is any guide, another
consequence of consolidation will be deterioration in customer
service, as ever more dealings with the public are shunted to
automated systems. Though a case can be made that heightened
competition among giants in banking or securities brokerage has led
to lower prices for some customers, insurance rates could instead
be driven up, as mutual insurers, created and managed specifically
to provide low-cost insurance, are converted into shareholder-owned
businesses with profit as their main objective.
</P>
<P>
   Any ``surplus'' generated by a mutual company was supposed to be
returned to policyholders as dividends, effectively lowering the
net cost of insurance; shareholders will expect profits to be
plowed back into continued growth or used to buy back shares
instead, while policyholders get just enough insurance benefits to
stay ahead of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, the insurance industry is likely to
resemble the oceanic food chain. The nimblest and most aggressive
of the small insurers will gobble up slower and smaller rivals.
Bigger insurers will probably swallow them, and others nearer their
own size. At the top of the chain, huge financial conglomerates
like Citigroup, GE Capital and the giant banks, brokerage firms and
mutual funds are expected to devour many of the biggest insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The predators who may be eyeing the bigger fish in American
insurance most avidly are the giant European insurance and banking
companies. The world's two largest insurers, Allianz of Germany and
AXA of France, already have substantial holdings in the United
States; so do ING Group and Aegon from the Netherlands and Fortis
of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big European companies have made no secret that they plan
to move into the United States in a bigger way,'' said Jeff Sawyer,
who is in charge of insurance at Deloitte Consulting in New York.
And their market capitalizations are large enough to make
swallowing a major American acquisition feasible: investors value
Allianz at about $85 billion, and AXA at $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The best cross-industry merger fit may be between big retail
banks and life insurers. Both are fundamentally in the investment
business, and bank branches and insurance agents can readily sell
each others' products. (In limited ways some already do.)
</P>
<P>
   And it is easy to see similar advantages in a combination
between property and casualty insurers on the one hand and consumer
credit companies like mortgage lenders and auto-finance houses on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, like Wells Fargo, have already expressed interest in
owning insurance companies. Others, pointing to a history of
insurance companies' tending to be less profitable than banks, say
they may be better off with marketing agreements, earning fees from
selling insurance but avoiding the heavy lifting of underwriting
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning sounds like a smoke screen to some analysts.
``The insurance companies are a great fit for the banks,'' said
Andrew S. Kligerman, an insurance analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co., which
sold its investment banking and research units to Citigroup just
last week. ``But why should the banks broadcast their interest? Why
not tell people, `We're not interested,' and continue to see the
insurance stocks trade at low multiples and get them cheap? The
life companies are sitting ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two brokerage houses, Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, already own
small insurance companies, as does Fidelity Investments, the big
mutual fund company. ``Why not leverage that with the expertise and
scale of a bigger insurer, and get some real bang out of those
operations?'' Kligerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining deals in the other direction, with insurers acquiring
banks, is harder. As much as some insurance executives might want
to get into the banking business, it seems unlikely that they will
have the muscle to start out with a flourish by buying a big bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have, on average, returns on equity in the high teens
and low 20s,'' said Jon Boscia, chief executive of the Lincoln
National Group, a life insurance and annuities company with a stock
market value of about $7 billion. ``That gives the banks high
price-earnings multiples that make it virtually impossible for most
insurance companies, with substantially lower price earnings
multiples, to be buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several insurers are easing into banking by obtaining thrift
charters. Among them are State Farm, the big auto and home insurer,
and American International Group, the most international of the big
American insurers and one of the few with the financial strength to
contemplate a bank takeover.
</P>
<P>
   However the merger dance with the banks and brokerage houses
plays out, the pace of evolution within the insurance business is
only going to quicken. There are simply too many insurance
companies, and many have been run too complacently for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer sees the cross hairs of the big insurers coming to rest
on a ``killing zone'' in the marketplace: high quality mid-cap
insurance companies with market values up to about $10 billion.
These are companies that are big enough to be worthwhile
acquisitions but are too small to afford heavy spending for
computer technology that might catapult their earnings and share
prices, or to bulk up rapidly with acquisitions to fend off the
barracudas.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Allmerica Financial, a Worcester, Mass., insurer
whose market capitalization is now about $2.5 billion. Though it
sells homeowners and auto insurance, it is best known for its life
and annuity products and its success in selling through financial
planning seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Another company often mentioned in the same breath is Reliastar
Financial of Minneapolis, which specializes in life insurance and
annuities, also sold through seminars, and has a stock market value
of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies would be a good fit and be easily affordable
for a Met or a Pru,'' said Colin Devine, an insurance analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney. But a hungry insurer would have to move
swiftly: Allmerica or Reliastar would also be just right for a
Merrill Lynch or a Wells Fargo, Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   The American General Corp., a Texas-based life insurer with a
market value of about $14 billion that has itself grown rapidly
with a string of recent acquisitions, and two life insurers in the
$6 billion to $7 billion range, Jefferson Pilot and Lincoln
National, are also considered likely takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see Lincoln National as meshing neatly with a
brokerage house like Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. ``Lincoln National is
excellent at asset management, estate planning and retirement
sales, which is just what Schwab needs as its customers get
older,'' Devine said. T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore mutual fund
company, might be another possible buyer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the action will not be limited to the ``killing zone.'' Some
of the most famous names in insurance are being sized up for
takeover, especially in the auto and homeowners businesses, where
higher-than-expected operating expenses have driven down share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of one stellar name, Allstate, has been trading at
about $24 a share, down from $41 a year ago and just a bit above
book value. Two of its rivals, Progressive and Safeco, have also
become vulnerable as their share prices have declined to little
more than book value.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life, which has a growing auto and homeowners
division, and AIG are regarded as potential buyers of Allstate.
Wall Street analysts also speculate that Warren E. Buffett might
want to meld Allstate with Geico, his discount auto insurer. But
Ms. Schroeder of PaineWebber, who has become a specialist on
Buffett, said she thought Buffett would prefer to expand in auto
insurance by achieving internal growth with Geico.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Financial Services, which does a big business in auto,
homeowners and commercial insurance and is the parent of Hartford
Life, the leading seller of variable annuities, turns up on many
handicappers' target lists these days; again, Met Life and AIG are
mentioned as buyers that would find Hartford a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Three mid-sized commercial insurers with substantial capital
surpluses _ the Reliance Group, Fremont General and Frontier
Insurance Group _ are also trading at depressed prices. And the
trend extends to reinsurers, who sell backup coverage to insurance
companies. Two Bermuda-based reinsurers, ACE Ltd. and XL Capital,
have begun providing insurance that is akin to bonds, and some
analysts say they would be a natural acquisition for investment
banking houses like Goldman, Sachs, Lehman Brothers or Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. All three firms already have units that put
together packages of bonds that function like insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size, industry leaders like John Hancock,
Metropolitan and Prudential have as much reason to worry about
being acquired as any of their smaller brethren. They are sleeping
giants who own some of the best-known brand names in the country
but have been sheltered from relentless pressure for profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders, who see themselves as customers rather than
collective owners of their companies, rarely ask for details of a
company's performance as long as they are confident the money will
be there to pay claims. So the return on equity for these companies
has been, by the standards of publicly traded companies,
appallingly low, sometimes as little as 3 percent or 4 percent,
one-fifth or one-sixth that posted by healthy banks.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that will change, as the siren of the bull market
beckons all three giants to cast off mutual ownership and its
comforts and protections. The big question is whether they will
have enough time to execute their acquisition and growth plans
before someone makes a move on them.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the danger of an immediate feeding frenzy, and the
sweeping layoffs and economic dislocation that might result,
regulators in the home states _ Massachusetts, New York and New
Jersey _ of the three big companies have thrown up barriers to
takeover for at least two or three years after they go public.
Still, ``they will be very susceptible to acquisition if they don't
come out of the protected period cruising at a higher level of
returns,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   When mutual insurers convert to stock ownership, their
accumulated profits must by law be divided among the mutual
policyholders, which can feel like a windfall, though technically
it was their money all along. The bigger winners are the executives
of the companies, who after an initial waiting period can begin
paying themselves millions in bonuses through stock options, which
did not exist when the companies were mutuals.
</P>
<P>
   The companies argue that mutual ownership, by denying them the
ability to issue stock, hamstrings their efforts to make
acquisitions, finance investments in new technology and attract and
retain top talent, dooming them to wither away on the sidelines
while nimbler competitors offer cheaper, better insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   But those sentiments are not unanimous among mutual companies. A
few believe they can prosper while sticking to the old structure,
whipping themselves into stock company-like efficiency and buying
as many other companies as they can with cash. They are betting
that the coming turmoil in the insurance business will be repellant
to some customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that when people see all this instability, they'll
wish they could go back to the old days,'' said Sy Sternberg, chief
executive of the New York Life Insurance Co. ``And we'll be the old
days _ the same policy, the same company with the same name, not a
subsidiary of some big American or European conglomerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Instability there will certainly be. ``Within the next five
years,'' said Sawyer of Deloitte Consulting, ``you are going to see
a dramatically smaller number of American insurance companies. I
would have a lot of sleepless nights if I were an insurance company
executive.''

AFTER DEATH OF PATIENT, FDA SHUTS DOWN GENE THERAPY EXPERIMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Pa., Calif., Tenn.)   (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday
that it was temporarily shutting down every human gene therapy
experiment at the University of Pennsylvania after an inspection
uncovered ``numerous serious deficiencies'' in ensuring patient
safety during a clinical trial that cost an 18-year-old Arizona man
his life.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to place the entire program _ eight experiments,
including five active clinical trials in diseases including cystic
fibrosis and breast cancer _ on ``clinical hold'' is highly
unusual. The hold is indefinite, FDA officials said, and will not
be lifted until the agency is convinced that the university's
Institute for Human Gene Therapy can follow federal rules designed
to protect study volunteers from harm.
</P>
<P>
   The agency notified the Penn scientists of the decision in a
two-page letter Friday. In response, the university President
Judith Rodin, pledged to appoint a committee of outside scientists
to review the institute's work. In a statement, she said Penn had
``cooperated fully with all aspects of the FDA's investigation, and
would continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's action comes two days after its investigators
completed a detailed inspection of patient records and laboratory
data from the experiment that resulted in the death of Jesse
Gelsinger of Tucson in September. Gelsinger was the first person to
die as a direct result of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings were made public last month during a
meeting of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the panel that
oversees gene therapy research for the National Institutes of
Health. Those findings included evidence that Gelsinger was
ineligible for the experiment and that the scientists failed to
report serious side effects in other patients that could have
halted the study.
</P>
<P>
   But the final inspection report, which cited 18 specific
violations, also turned up new problems. It found, for instance,
that the Pennsylvania scientists had enrolled all 18 patients
without filling out eligibility forms, a routine step for
complicated experiments like gene therapy. Instead, the FDA said,
the scientists created the forms and filled them out after
Gelsinger died, leaving them unsigned and undated. By that time,
the FDA's inquiry had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the many concerns that we have had about the
conduct of the study,'' said Dr. Philip Noguchi, the agency
official in charge of gene therapy research. ``It indicates to us
that the sponsor was not following rules, was not following our
regulations and in general was not reporting to F.D.A. in a timely
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Wilson, the director of the university's gene therapy
institute, did not take telephone calls Friday. But in the past, he
strongly defended his work, including the decision to treat
Gelsinger, who died Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The death rocked the nine-year-old field of gene therapy, a
field that has had few treatment successes. Friday's announcement
by the FDA marked yet another blow. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at
the University of Pennsylvania who has closely followed the
developments there, said the move could hurt gene therapy programs
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are violations and problems it can have a devastating
impact across the board, for all gene therapy research, at every
institution,'' Caplan said. He predicted a ``loss of funding and a
loss of enthusiasm,'' as well as tougher oversight regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already indicated its concern. Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., has called a hearing for next week to examine whether
there is sufficient oversight for patient safety in gene therapy
experiments. In a statement, Frist said Friday's announcement
raised ``a red flag regarding patient safety in experimental
clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the featured speakers at next week's hearing will be Paul
Gelsinger, Jesse Gelsinger's father. Until now, the elder Gelsinger
has steadfastly supported the scientists at Penn, maintaining they
had done nothing wrong even as the FDA released its highly critical
preliminary results last month. But Friday, he indicated that he
had changed his mind, and said he had hired a lawyer, although no
suit has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was wrong,'' Gelsinger said sadly, in a brief
telephone conversation from Tucson. ``Even me.'' He declined to
elaborate, instead referring questions to the lawyer, Alan
Milstein, who said he was not surprised by the FDA's move. ``It
seems appropriate in light of what happened to Jesse,'' Milstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, leaders of the gene therapy field also
appeared to be backing away from their support for Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we are surprised at this,'' Savio Woo,
president of the American Society for Gene Therapy, said in a
telephone interview. ``But that being said, we support the FDA's
action as being appropriate. If there are all these numerous
violations then any situation would need to be put on hold until
they can clean up their act.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. W. French Anderson, a gene therapy scientist at the
University of Southern California, said, ``I feel very sad for the
University of Pennsylvania, because it's a superb program, but it
does sound like they did not take the various FDA reporting rules
as conscientiously as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agency's findings were serious flaws in the way Penn
scientists administered informed consent to patients. For nine of
the 18 patients, the agency said, ``The consent process was not
well documented.'' Investigators could not always determine who
conducted the informed consent discussions, and who answered the
questions; in one case, for example, a patient and a witness signed
the informed consent document on March 17, 1997, but the
investigator signed it on June 5, a week before the gene therapy
was administered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While those failures may sound like minor details of record
keeping, Anderson said that the FDA took them seriously, especially
when a pattern emerged. Noguchi said Friday that the deficiencies
reflected ``the state of conduct of the trial'' and added that
there were clear ``protocol violations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation was continuing but would not
elaborate. The next step, he said, is for Wilson to respond to the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Gelsinger's death has generated so much
controversy is that he was not particularly sick before he died. He
suffered from a relatively mild form of ornithine transcarbamylase,
or OTC, deficiency, an inherited disorder in which the liver is
unable to process ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of protein.
The disorder was kept in check through diet and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in which Gelsinger participated was designed to
test a treatment for babies with a fatal form of the disease. It
involved an infusion of trillions of particles of the OTC gene,
tucked inside a weakened cold virus. The infusion provoked a
violent immune reaction in Gelsinger; he suffered jaundice, a
blood-clotting disorder, kidney failure, lung failure and
eventually brain death.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has consistently maintained that the Penn scientists had
no evidence that would have led them to predict Gelsinger's death,
and Noguchi of the FDA would not say whether the agency thought the
death could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate on what these things really mean,''
he said.

GERMANY PUSHES DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER TO HEAD IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also G7-JAPAN-MEET) 
(rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ German officials have stepped up a campaign to
install one of their own as head of the International Monetary
Fund, using a lukewarm endorsement by President Clinton to rally
support and break a three-month deadlock on selecting a new leader
for the global financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have been touting a private telephone
conversation between Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Clinton as
evidence of growing international support for Caio Koch-Weser, a
technocratic deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   During a discussion about the succession at the monetary fund,
Clinton gave Schroeder the impression that the United States would
not veto the German choice, provided that Germany persuaded all the
Europeans to back its candidate, German officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Schroeder has put his prestige on the line to
win backing for Koch-Weser, whom most European and American
financial officials say they regard as a competent but uninspired
choice for the job. The German leader has called in foreign
ambassadors based in Germany and lobbied his counterparts
worldwide, starting what some diplomats called an
uncharacteristically aggressive German campaign for a key
international post.
</P>
<P>
   As with much in the opaque process of selecting a leader for the
monetary fund, however, American support was hardly clear-cut.
Clinton administration officials confirm that Clinton did not
threaten to veto Koch-Weser's candidacy when he spoke with
Schroeder, but said that should not be misread as indicating that
Clinton backed the German for the job.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say privately that they would prefer Europe
to put forward another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The direct involvement of Schroeder and the parsing of
diplomatic conversations shows how sensitive the succession process
at the monetary fund has become. In recent years, the fund has
become a global political and financial force, negotiating with
Russian and Indonesian leaders during crises in those countries and
serving as the West's financial ambassador to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has had a difficult time agreeing on people to
lead global institutions. Asian and Western nations argued for
months over who should head the World Trade Organization before
agreeing to split the term so rival candidates could both serve.
European countries failed to back a single candidate to head the
continent's new central bank and eventually agreed to allow two
contenders to serve truncated terms as well. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development went without a boss for nine months
while countries debated who should lead it.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that Germany's steadfast lobbying for Koch-Weser could
produce a similarly muddled result for the monetary fund. Germany
has extracted commitments from several European partners to back
Koch-Weser, people involved in the process said. But the
commitments are often contingent on Germany lining up support
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, the Frenchman who currently heads the fund,
leaves the post in mid-February, having announced his early
retirement in November. While it is still possible that a consensus
candidate will emerge by then, it now seems likely that the post
will remain vacant for a time. That would leave Stanley Fischer,
the No. 2 official and a naturalized American, in charge.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are determined to break the deadlock with a
public lobbying effort. They say they are increasingly optimistic
that Koch-Weser can get the necessary support.
</P>
<P>
   Among big European countries only France, which has had one of
its nationals as head of the monetary fund for most of the fund's
history, including the last 13 years, has declined to offer any
support to Koch-Weser, the officials say. Schroeder was planning to
meet with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
in Paris Friday to try to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say for sure, but there is a quite positive
feeling now,'' a German government official said. ``Chancellor
Schroeder has upped the ante _ this is his choice for the job.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Germany, which has only recently begun pushing for a share of
leadership posts at European and international institutions, views
Koch-Weser as a logical choice for the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an economist, he served as an officer at the World
Bank, the monetary fund's sister institution, for 26 years,
specializing in health and development projects. One of his
responsibilities: coordinating the World Bank's poverty-relief
programs with similar efforts at the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   For American officials, that's part of the problem. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers has pushed to change the way the
monetary fund operates, urging it to focus largely on managing
financial crises instead of poverty relief. Koch-Weser is not the
ideal person to carry out such changes, the American thinking goes.
</P>
<P>
   Some European officials also say they wonder if Koch-Weser has
the stature to go head-to-head with the likes of Boris Yeltsin, the
former Russian leader, or former President Suharto of Indonesia.
Both countries resisted applying economic reforms urged on them by
the monetary fund in return for foreign aid, requiring regular
intervention by Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the staunch German backing for Koch-Weser has given his
candidacy an air of inevitability. Germany would be reluctant to
step aside, and fellow Europeans would be reluctant to openly
challenge the German choice, unless a rival who clearly outranks
Koch-Weser, such as a seasoned central banker, a finance minister
or a prime minister, throws a hat in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome is still possible. Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer, Gordon Brown, has been widely mentioned as an
alternative, but has not publicly shown an interest in the job.
Several Italian leaders, including the country's foreign minister
and treasury director, have also been named as possible monetary
fund chiefs, but are seen as unlikely to enter the race unless
Germany backs off.
</P>
<P>
   The only other publicly declared candidate for the job is Eisuke
Sakakibara, a former vice finance minister of Japan. He is given
little chance of winning. Europeans have traditionally led the
monetary fund, as Americans have led the World Bank, and Europe is
not seen as ready to cede the post.

SPORTS COLUMN: SO CLOSE AND SO FAR, THANKFULLY 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Last year at this time, Kyle Brady was
playing for the New York Jets in the American Football Conference
championship game. The Jets lost to Denver but Brady walked off the
field that day confident that his team was sailing toward something
very big. A year later, Brady is preparing for his second straight
AFC championship game. Instead of sitting in the Jets' cramped
locker room in frosty New York, Brady, thanks to the miracle of
free agency, is sitting in the sprawling locker room of the
Jacksonville Jaguars in sunny Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Parcells balked at re-signing him, Brady signed a
five-year, $14 million contract with the Jaguars, who gave him a $4
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a big risk at the time, signing with another
team,'' Brady said. ``The Jets were on such a quick rise to the
top. It seems as if they were one step away from the big prize. So
I thought, `Wow, this might be the team next year, the Jets might
be the team.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a span of four months, Brady has watched the Jets' fortunes
plummet. Before this season was two weeks old, the Jets had lost an
owner, a star running back, a wide receiver and a starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' Brady said Friday. ``For one thing. I
still have a lot of feelings and emotional ties with a lot of those
guys. I felt bad for a lot of them. I didn't wish that they had a
terrible year. When I saw that I knew right away it was going to be
a tough year for them. To regroup after that kind of blow is tough.
And it was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that happened, I said, `Wow, this might end up being
a much better place to be.' It became clearer every week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets signed Eric Green, the once outstanding tight end, to a
four-year, $7.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Green suffered through the most unproductive season of his
10-year career. By mid-December an injury had shut down his season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been trade-offs for Brady. His role with Jacksonville
is straightforward and traditional. He is used mainly as a blocker
and sometimes sits when Jacksonville uses a three wide receiver
set. Brady started 13 games, and caught 32 passes for 346 yards and
one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were more creative. In addition to using him as a tight
end, the Jets used the 6-foot-6-inch Brady as a fullback and as a
moving blocker. Still, when Brady left, he was amused by the spin
Parcells put on the Jets' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the initial comments he made to the New York papers
was, `Hey, we've done well for ourselves this off-season; we've
upgraded at tight end.' I kind of laughed about those comments
because all he did was praise me last year,'' Brady said. ``He
praised me for what I did for the offense. The first thing they did
when I go _ when they let me go to free agency _ was to start
downplaying my role.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he grew to like Parcells, who, despite his football
similarities with Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin, is quite
different personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Parcells is at times very loose, as far as cracking at
people, joking and stuff,'' Brady said. ``Coach Coughlin is more
disciplined, regimented, almost military in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Parcells has been leaning toward the Jets' front
office and away from coaching, Brady may be the shimmering example
of the coach's blind spot when it comes to evaluating talent.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, as a Jets front-office guru, has enjoyed mixed
results.
</P>
<P>
   He has drafted good, unknown offensive linemen and brought in
good veteran players. On the other hand, his timing and foresight
have been atrocious. Parcells failed to secure a backup for the
starting quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, then went too long with
Rick Mirer and brought Ray Lucas in too late. He let Brady go and
gambled that Eric Green would be the answer for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brady is a game away from the Super Bowl. The Jets,
suddenly, seem leagues away from that big prize.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Jets got a favorable ruling from the National
Football League. It said that Bill Belichick breached his contract
with the team by resigning, which prevents Belichick from
immediately pursuing other NFL coaching jobs without the Jets'
permission. Hours later, the Jets said they would name their coach,
probably Al Groh and not Parcells, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For Brady, the raging issues over Parcells and the Jets seem
like a career away. Jacksonville is a game away from the Super
Bowl; Brady is content. He is the passenger who left the sinking
ship in the nick of time.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Shortly before the bloody military coup of
1973, Ricardo Lagos was appointed by President Salvador Allende
Gossens as ambassador to Moscow, and now he is poised to become the
second Socialist president in Chile's history.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist of post-Cold War ideology and politics, Lagos, 61,
comes to power expressing support for business and promising to
govern as a Western European-style Socialist in the mold of former
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign that concluded a few days ago, Lagos
expressed few economic positions that varied substantially from
those of Joaquin Lavin, his right-wing opponent. He promised to
eliminate the budget deficit in an effort to bring down interest
rates and to expand business. He suggested that he would reduce
capital controls on foreign investors. He even praised unions that
permitted layoffs in factories that needed to be refitted to become
competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos can be expected to increase spending on education and
health to fulfill his campaign slogan of ``growth with equality.''
Economists say an expansion of growth, which resumed three months
ago, should pay for such programs without increasing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising, he and his aides have promoted plans to
quicken the pace of privatizations started by the two previous
Christian Democratic presidents who have led the governing
center-left coalition over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has repeatedly said he wants to overhaul Codelco, the
state copper company that influences nearly a third of the economy,
by entering into joint ventures with foreign companies and infusing
it with investments from domestic pension funds. And Andres
Velasco, a Harvard economics professor who Lagos has said is likely
to have an important post in his government, has called for
privatization of the state oil company, ENAP. The president-elect
reportedly plans to select and announce the names of his ministers
by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference early this week, Lagos predicted that Chile
would resume growth in excess of 6 percent this year after
suffering a severe recession because of weak copper prices and
reduced trade with Asia through the second half of 1998 and the
first three quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very optimistic,'' the president-elect said, ``and I
believe that businessmen are going to respond to this opportunity,
and respond strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some executives are still concerned about Lagos, in large part
because many in his Socialist party remain lukewarm about the free
market. But Walter Riesco, one of the most conservative business
leaders and president of the Confederation of Commerce and
Production, had conciliatory words for Lagos in an interview in the
financial newspaper El Diario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the Ricardo Lagos government will mean success
for the country,'' Riesco said, ``and we businessmen are disposed
to work for the good of all.''
</P>
<P>
   What local businessmen fear most, at least in the short term, is
that Lagos will press a labor reform bill now bottled up in
Congress. It would prohibit the use of replacement workers in
strikes and establish industry-wide collective bargaining,
requiring small and medium-size companies to abide by the same
contracts as large ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagos said he would try to reach a consensus with the
opposition and with conservative Christian Democrats in his
governing coalition before reintroducing the legislation. ``It is
fundamental to preserve labor flexibility in the modern world,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   While Lagos' party has Marxist roots, he has been a leader of
its moderate wing. He has a doctorate in economics from Duke
University, and when many leaders in his party sought refuge in
East Germany, he chose to take a teaching position at the
University of North Carolina. As public works minister in the
current Christian Democrat-Socialist cabinet, Lagos won high marks
from the construction industry for his fairness in negotiating with
private companies and for pushing the privatization of airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lagos economic policy will be a continuation of the last
10 years, but speeding up many issues that have not been addressed,
like modernization of the capital markets and our tax system,''
said Jose de Gregorio, a University of Chile economist who is to
have a major post in the new administration. de Gregorio added that
Lagos would also work to introduce unemployment insurance, ``which
should allow flexibility and mobility in the labor market while
protecting poor families.''
</P>
<P>
   Socialist party leaders say they understand that they cannot
return to the policies of Allende, whose government nationalized
much of the economy and encouraged strikes and worker takeovers of
factories. Allende was killed in the 1973 coup, many of whose
preceding events were supported by the Nixon administration and the
Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country that has suffered much in the past from
economic instability,'' Finance Minister Manuel Marfan, a
Socialist, said in an interview on Wednesday. ``Now we have a broad
consensus to avert that kind of instability in the future.'' Chile,
he added, ``will continue to be a country of opportunities for
foreign and domestic investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors hope that the next government will repeal a
capital control that requires that the equivalent of 10 percent of
foreign investments be deposited in a one-year, noninterest-bearing
escrow account at the central bank. That rule was suspended last
year, but an outright repeal can only be invoked by the central
bank, which Lagos promises will be independent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market here has been choppy for much of the week, as
markets have been throughout the region, but investors seem to be
responding calmly to Lagos' election. On Friday, the benchmark
stock index fell .2 percent, and the Chilean peso, which has
recovered some of its lost value in the last couple of months,
declined to a rate of 519.25 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Trebat, Salomon Smith Barney's chief economist for Latin
America, said he thought the government would reduce regulation and
ease capital controls. ``Lagos is a member of the Socialist
party,'' he said, ``but we think he will show responsible economic
management.''

U.S. HALTS HUMAN RESEARCH AT ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ala.)   (With SCI-GENE-THERAPY) 
(jw) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of problems for universities over
federal ethical rules, the University of Alabama was told on
Thursday to shut down about a quarter of its research involving
human subjects, about 550 experiments, mostly medical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The order came from the Office of Protection from Research
Risks, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. It
did not restrict the university's ability to conduct other
research.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama action was the agency's seventh such move in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, as in each of the other cases, the agency found that
the university had frequently violated federal rules. Under these
rules, researchers who want to use federal funds for research on
humans must obtain prior approval for their plans to assure that
patients will be safe and will be informed about the risks they
will face.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for each experiment must be approved by a university
review board, and then the experiment must be checked later to see
if the original plans and the ethical rules are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials told the university that its review board
routinely failed to check whether the research was being conducted
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Turnbough, a university spokeswoman, said the experiments
with patients already enrolled or about to be enrolled might be
restarted within days as the review board checked to see that
guidelines were being followed. A more complete review of each case
would take longer, Ms. Turnbough said.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Political Science 231 at Quinnipiac College
begins in a Comfort Inn conference room with lectures on
presidential primaries. But the real learning comes later, after
the students collect their assignments from campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   They face single-digit temperatures as they canvass
neighborhoods for their candidates. They study the three S's _
stuffing, stamping and sealing _ of mass mailings. They stand on
street corners waving placards, hoping for honks of encouragement
but also collecting their share of thumbs down and other
unsupportive gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have the hands-on kind of learning,'' said Jessica
Cieslak, 20, a sophomore from Simsbury, Conn., as she sat in an old
furniture warehouse here calling undecided voters on behalf of
former Sen. Bill Bradley. ``I feel like you retain a lot more
because you're thrown into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Political science does not typically come with a laboratory
requirement, but New Hampshire in the weeks leading up to its
primary is irresistible educational for scholars and students.
Professors flock here, and to Iowa as the caucuses approach, for
research, and the states are crawling with young people, both the
die-hards who have long served as foot soldiers in campaigns of all
kinds and detached visitors like the Quinnipiac students who come
more to watch and learn.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you have pizza with Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida,
shake hands with Eugene J. McCarthy and pose for a snapshot with
Vice President Al Gore all in one weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens within a 50-mile radius of the hotel,''
said Dale Keuhne, director of the New Hampshire Institute of
Politics at St. Anselm College here. ``You get to watch the
commercials. Every day, you can go to see a candidate. You can hang
out and talk to them. If you're a politics professor, where else
can you go that's so ideal?''
</P>
<P>
   The Elections and Political Parties course at Quinnipiac, a
college of 3,300 undergraduates in Hamden, Conn., that is best
known for its political polling, is an experiment in the growing
service-learning movement, in which regular class sessions are
combined with volunteer work. The 17 students, most political
science majors, take notes each morning as Scott McLean outlines
the history of the primary system and New Hampshire politics, then
reflect in their journals each evening on their experiences in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire College in Manchester has similar courses
requiring campaign work, and a class from Tufts University in
Medford, Mass., will visit New Hampshire on Saturday. Last weekend,
20 Harvard University fellows from around the globe had a daylong
seminar on the primary.
</P>
<P>
   At the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, the
National Affairs Reporting class plans to spend the four days
before the Feb. 1 primary in the news media circus that is
Manchester, where students can report and write about campaign
events while studying professional journalists doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   At Drake University in Des Moines, an institution that some
political junkies choose because of its proximity to the action,
three students earned credit this fall helping a professor whose
research focuses on the Iowa caucuses track candidates and
newspaper coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come back very, very energized and enamored of American
democracy,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a professor of government at
Georgetown University, whose book on the 2000 elections is used in
the Quinnipiac class. ``It shows them that democracy works, so that
they don't start necessarily being disillusioned. That's very
important because one of the things we're contending with today is
these people who say it doesn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Quinnipiac students, taking the course required giving
up a week of winter break and paying $225 on top of their course
fee for motel rooms and and dinners at KFC and Wendy's. More than
half had never worked in campaigns, though the group includes Angie
Cowan, president of the Quinnipiac Democrats, and Aaron Blank, who
is running for student body president this March (and, according to
his signature on a banner at Bradley headquarters, plans to be a
candidate in the New Hampshire primary in 2030).
</P>
<P>
   The lessons include the cardinal rule of canvassing _ never
touch the mailbox, for fear of violating federal law _ and the
nuances of the candidates' health care plans. There may be a
dissertation in comparing the free food offered by front-runners
and underdogs, and the students are expert in scrawling ``Sorry we
missed you'' on campaign leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're contributing small pieces to a greater
puzzle,'' said Sally Roden, a junior majoring in mass
communications, as she stuck thousands of address labels on yellow
postcards inviting supporters to a Super Bowl party with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see these little things you get in the mail, you just kind
of throw them aside,'' Ms. Roden said of the postcards. ``You never
think that somebody had to stick all these labels on. When you're
in the classroom, it's not as tangible as when you're doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a handful of the students had come to New Hampshire in
November to canvass for Gore, most were undecided when they
registered for the class and used a questionnaire on
www.selectsmart.com to find the candidate nearest their views.
Kristen Busch, a 19-year-old sophomore, signed up with Sen. John
McCain largely because she, like he, is from Arizona, then found
herself flustered her first day working on the phone bank when a
voter angrily challenged the candidate's stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what his abortion position was,'' Ms. Busch
said, a bit embarrassed. ``I always thought, `Oh, John McCain, my
parents like him.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the students are thrilled with the course, as much for
the chance to meet the candidates, or just wave signs on their
behalf, as for the opportunity to grow closer to their classmates
than lecture and seminar formats allow. They will stay in
Manchester through Saturday morning, and most plan to return for
the rush of campaign activity the weekend before the primary. Back
in Connecticut, they are required to volunteer in local campaign
offices, write two papers and take a final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Still unsure whether she shares McCain's anti-abortion position,
Ms. Busch said her few days on the campaign had already taught her
a lot about abortion, gays in the military and ``how highly
respected he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, McLean outlined the demographics of the New Hampshire
electorate, with its huge contingent of independent voters. Hours
later, on Poplar Road, Blank encountered one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you leaning toward anybody in particular?'' he asked the
man, pushing a Bradley brochure through the crack in the door
before it was slammed against the cold gusts. ``Is there any
information you'd like?''
</P>
<P>
   The audience was even tougher on the phone, as students dialed
New Hampshire residents already besieged by campaigns and were told
the names on their lists had moved away or died long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey doesn't live here,'' Blank recalled an irate woman
saying, ``and you better tell him to tell his friends not to call
here anymore.''

Bill Bradley, running for the Democratic presidential nominatin,
walks with supporters through town for a rally, Friday. Bradley
said his recent episodes of irregular heartbeats are a ``nuisance''
possibly caused by drinking too much caffeine in cream sodas, and
irrelevant to his Democratic presidential campaign. (Keith

toy during Gore's visit to the pediatrics ward of Mercy Medical

George Nash and police officer David Moore, right, look over an air
bag at a repair shop on Thursday. The device was taken by the
officers to check if it was stolen. It hasn't been the cars that
are vanishing lately in New York City. It's been the thieves.
During the past decade, as crime declined throughout the five
boroughs, no other crime has fallen as dramatically as auto theft.

electronic newsstand in the concourse of the John Hancock Tower
earlier this week. After 138 years as a company owned by millions
of ordinary policyholders, Hancock is about to put itself in the
hands of investors. The impending change has forced a massive
cultural shift at the Boston insurer, which must learn new fiscal
discipline and imbue nearly 9,000 employees with a market

Yukon huskies take a break while pulling a sled across Lake
Umbagog, in western Maine, earlier this month. There are more
conventional ways to travel 6 miles across a frozen lake than
hitching five yipping Yukon huskies to a wooden toboggan sled and
balancing on narrow runners while the dogs charge off, full speed.
But they are not as much fun. (Dominic Chavez/The Boston Globe)

NORTHRIDGE BASEBALL PROGRAM EARNING LOYALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Batesole sometimes feels like Tom Sawyer,
when the character tricks his friends into painting the fence for
him because he makes it look like so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Cal State Northridge baseball team prepares
for its season, which begins with Sunday's alumni game, Batesole,
Northridge's coach, finds himself sitting in a Matador Field dugout
at 8:30 a.m. watching several players tending the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the grass is still wet,'' Batesole said, ``and guys are
setting up. Two hours early. Why are they here? They know it's
important. .. No one's luckier than me. I'm picking up a paycheck
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Batesole and Sawyer (besides the obvious
real vs. fictional comparisons) is Batesole isn't tricking his
players. He genuinely enjoys his job.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, so do his players. Practice doesn't begin until 10:30
a.m., but by 9:15, just about the entire team had arrived at the
field and players were taking early batting practice or throwing in
the bullpen or stretching.
</P>
<P>
   The loyalty is evident, and Batesole is the reason why. The
alumni game is expected to bring together 40 of Northridge's elite
players, including current major-leaguers Adam Kennedy and Rob
Fick.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for loyalty? Kennedy said he hasn't been approached
by the university, but if he was asked to donate money to build a
new stadium, he said only if Batesole was coach.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN cut the program in 1996, infielders Adrian Mendoza and
Eric Horvat didn't transfer because of Batesole. Mendoza considers
Batesole a second father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sets the example. He comes early,'' Mendoza said. ``So how
hard is it for me to come out an hour early and take extra BP?''
</P>
<P>
   Horvat had just graduated from Hart High in Newhall when the
program was cut. He nonetheless decided to come to Northridge
because he liked the way Batesole dealt with him as a recruit.
Horvat felt Batesole was honest with him, telling him not what he
wanted to hear but saying those who work the hardest will play.
</P>
<P>
   When Horvat played in a summer league in Virginia, players from
Florida recognized the name Northridge. Horvat says that's because
of Batesole.
</P>
<P>
   However, the loyalty to the program stretches beyond Batesole.
Several alumni who played for Robert Hiegert 20 years ago and for
Bill Kernen 10 years ago will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole recognizes the importance of links to the past, but
whether or not the members of the 2000 team will return for alumni
games 10 years from now remains to be seen. For now, he's happy
sharing early-morning hours with his players.

RABBI CHOSEN TO HEAD HOLOCAUST MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has selected an Orthodox rabbi
from New York who was involved in the planning of the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum in the 1980s as its new chairman, the
White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi, Irving Greenberg, is the president of the Jewish Life
Network, a New York foundation dedicated to the strengthening of
Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg would succeed Miles Lerman, who announced earlier this
month that he was stepping down as chairman. The nomination is
subject to routine background checks before it can be made
official.
</P>
<P>
   Lerman was criticized last year by a nongovernmental agency, the
National Academy of Public Administration, for his ``excessive
involvement'' in the museum's day-to-day activities. But Greenberg
defended him Friday, saying Lerman had reduced his involvement in
the day-to-day management of the museum long before the study was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Friday, Greenberg said his
leadership would be ``less hands-on'' than Lerman's. He and the
museum's governing board, he said, would set policy and let the
museum's professional staff carry it out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Interest rates are rising. And though the effects on both
investors and consumers have been muted so far, almost everyone
will soon feel the impact, deep and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, rising rates make life more difficult for just about
everybody. For investors, higher rates will make gains in the stock
and bond markets trickier than ever to find. And the higher
borrowing costs that result from rising rates not only hurt
consumers who are shopping for a home, they also pinch companies
looking to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Federal Reserve Board has raised the benchmark
federal funds rate by three-quarters of one percentage point since
June, most bond market strategists believe there are more increases
to come. They expect the Fed to raise rates by at least one-half
point by April. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee
on Feb. 1 and 2 should produce the first of two quarter-point
increases, strategists say. From there it is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed is moving slowly, bond traders have been quick to
take rates on United States Treasury bonds higher. Yields on the
benchmark 30-year United States Treasury bond finished at 6.70
percent last week, up significantly from the 5.86 percent seen in
late August 1999. The yield on the 10-year Treasury _ at 6.77 _ is
now above the average yield of 6.65 percent seen over the entire
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these rate moves have done nothing to slow the roaring
economy or stock market down. This should change. ``By the first
half of the year, the impact of the tightening will be felt,'' said
Gemma Wright, senior interest rate strategist at Aubrey G. Lanston,
an investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Making this environment even more problematic is the fact that
interest rates have been in decline for so long that many investors
have forgotten what rising rates can do to their portfolios. Before
the most recent bout of increases, the last time the Fed raised
rates was in February 1994 when federal funds stood at 3 percent.
By the following May, the rate was at 6 percent and bonds were in
the midst of their worst year since 1927. Stocks basically treaded
water.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, investors must rethink their strategies _ or at least
their tactics. In the broadest terms, many of the investments that
made money in a declining rate environment will no longer do so
when rates are rising. And because increasing interest rates will
be more harmful to companies whose financial footing is shakier
than those on solid ground, hard-nosed risk assessment of a company
whose stock or bond looks attractive is crucial today.
</P>
<P>
   Among consumers, who have been happy to amass large amounts of
debt, a scaling back may be in order. This is particularly true for
those who borrowed at rates that fluctuate with the benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   And those planning charitable donations may want to check with
their accountants, too.
</P>

world, the following six articles guide investors and consumers
through what is likely to be a whole new ballgame. &QL;

   Stocks: Avoid Banks And Fasten Seat Belts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of rising interest rates has caused lots of
fulminating and gyrating in the stock market over the last few
months. Despite a palpable increase in volatility, major market
indexes have kept moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   The market's continued advance therefore sidesteps the question
of what _ if anything _ investors should do to hedge against, or
take advantage of, an increase in short-term interest rates of
anywhere from half a percentage point to a full percentage point by
the end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the consensus that rates are on the rise, few analysts
advocate radical changes in investment strategy. ``We think
interest rates will rise by at least half a percentage point,''
from current levels, said Frederick B. Taylor, vice chairman and
chief investment officer at the United States Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor challenges the idea that ``you should do anything if it
you think the increase is temporary and you are a long-term
investor. In our judgment, this is likely to be a temporary move.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be sectors that should be avoided.
Historically, for instance, rising rates have not been friendly to
financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But many regional and money center bank stocks have been
hammered over the last year. And that slide may limit the dimension
of any further decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very, very low price-earnings ratios among
financial stocks, which means you have a valuation cushion,'' said
Douglas R. Cliggott, domestic equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is very unusual for a bank stock to go up when the
discount rate is going up and its earnings growth rate is slowing
down,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cliggott, who says he is very underweight in financial stocks,
has both pared and rejiggered his model stock portfolio to best
exploit opportunities in a rising rate environment. ``We want
maximum exposure to the global recovery, and are looking at
companies with a lot of sales outside of the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliggott says ``you will see a lot stronger earnings growth this
year than last'' among ``industrial companies that had their
exports hammered and pricing pummeled, energy companies that are
benefitting from higher commodity prices and some of the big global
consumer goods companies.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rise in rates is sharper and of longer duration than most
expect, investors would be wise to cast a more skeptical eye over
corporate balance sheets, as interest costs of highly leveraged
companies would rise, too.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, agrees that rates are likely to rise, but remains
bullish on the stock market: 75 percent of his model portfolio is
committed to equities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are sectors he does not like because of the
likelihood of rising rates, a list that includes financial services
and housing stocks, which would suffer as potential home-buyers
find it costlier to borrow money. And he says rising rates may have
an impact on some housing-related retailers, like Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Cligott, who also underweights technology stocks,
Smith does not see bad things happening if interest rates continue
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very positive on software companies,'' he said. ``I don't
think people understand that as companies get past Y2K they will be
implementing new capabilities. Software companies, everyone from
Computer Associates to Compuware to BEA Software, will have more
demand than they can satisfy.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor at United States Trust also likes technology, even though
he admits the stocks are overpriced and ``likely to remain
overpriced'' even if interest rates go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to buy some of those industrial consumer-oriented
businesses that are users of technology that may not be as
expensive as the technology stocks,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   For Bond Investors: Pick the Ugly Ducklings &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost preposterous to contend that the bond market
could be a rewarding place to be this year. Not after turning in
its second-worst performance in a quarter century during 1999 _
negative returns at that _ as stocks, to rub it in, produced yet
another year of double-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   And not when an unusually strong professional consensus agrees
that the three-quarters of a percentage point that the Federal
Reserve has raised short-term interest rates since last summer gets
it just halfway to its likely goal.
</P>
<P>
   As rates rise, of course, prices fall. The math is ironclad. And
piling into a money market fund is not an unreasonable course of
action today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one does not have to be a knee-jerk contrarian to see
grounds for hope. For one thing, the bond market has almost never
gone south two years in a row. More importantly, some believe the
impending rise in rates seems likely to peak by mid-year, leading
to what might be a substantial rally.
</P>
<P>
   And if stocks falter in the meantime, bonds could get better
sooner by attracting scared equities money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back in action as an alternative to the wonderful world
of equities,'' Jack Malvey, chief global bond strategist for Lehman
Brothers, predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The way to play this prospect, according to Marilyn Cohen, a Los
Angeles adviser who specializes in bonds for individuals, is to
start accumulating these ugly ducklings now, but keeping maturities
short. With two-year and five-year United States Treasuries
yielding 6.45 percent and 6.63 percent, resepctively, nearly as
much as the 6.70 percent offered for those coming due in 30 years,
there is little incentive to risk buying the longer, more volatile
maturities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd start nibbling right away,'' said Ms. Cohen, who heads her
own firm, Envision Capital. The idea is to gradually feed in
additional money as rates rise, not worrying about catching the
yield peak, which few are lucky enough to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never rewarded in the good markets unless you are
venturesome and take a position in the bad markets,'' Ms. Cohen
said to justify a strategy, sound as it is, that risks being a bit
early.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that the Fed's tightening will, in fact, be
successful in cooling the economy, which will curb demand for
capital and allow rates to subside.
</P>
<P>
   That's when investors shovel in the rest of their stake, moving
out to more distant maturities. Keep in mind, though, that there is
no clear signal. The cooling may come earlier or later than
expected and the market may judge this well or poorly.
</P>
<P>
   For all investors know, the current dip of 30-year rates below
10-year rates, for example, may mean investors are already
expressing confidence that the Federal Reserve will succeed in
keeping inflation at bay. When everybody expects the long bond to
get to 7 percent, that's a reason for it not to happen.
</P>
<P>
   So which bonds to buy?
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries, which are extremely marketable, carry no risk of
default and are not taxable by state and local governments, are
preferred by many.
</P>
<P>
   But municipals, tax-free except for capital gains (and the
alternative minimum tax) currently yield nearly as much.
</P>
<P>
   And for the more venturesome, especially in 401(k) or other
tax-deferred accounts, investors might look at high-grade or
high-yield corporates, though these are not very liquid.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is likely to be the first thought that comes to
mind when investors think about the threat of rising interest rates
in the United States. Diversification is all about doing well in
one market while another is fairing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   But going abroad, in stocks or bonds, is no sure bet right now,
although some analysts think that Americans will be looking
overseas as their returns from American stocks come down to earth
against a backdrop of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that in recent years, diversification has not been
a protection against big swoons here. Sharp falls in the major
American stock indexes in 1997 and 1998 led the rest of the world
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the environments of foreign markets
themselves, which will not be much of a refuge if they sour in the
face of their own rising interest rates, too. In other words,
uncertainity here does not suggest certainty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the threat of an interest rate increase by the
European central bank as the Continental economies rebound has some
strategists worried about the outlook for both bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yields in France, Germany, Italy and Britain have been rising
since late last year. And key stock market indexes in Europe are
down so far this year, except in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the outlook is better. Japan is still attracting
investment from abroad as it struggles to keep its economic rebound
moving. With the economy just beginning to recover, rising interest
rates are not a major threat; currently rates are so low as to be
barely noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Asia is also coming back from the steep economic
declines that began with the sudden currency devaluations in the
summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley Capital International index of emerging stock
markets in Asia is up 3.8 percent this year, after rising 63
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in Asia, American investors face another problem: the
dollar, the other key factor in investments abroad. It was weak
against the Japanese yen and other Asian currencies in 1999, adding
strongly to returns for American investors as the stronger yen
value was translated back into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index in Japan was up 55.1 percent when the decline
in the dollar was factored in. If the dollar now rallies, it will
cut into American returns. This year's small dollar rally, for
example, has magnified the 0.30 percent loss in the Nikkei stock
index in yen terms to a loss of 2.46 percent in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar does offer some hope for American investors who place
their bets on Europe. If it swoons this year after a 16.2 percent
rally against the euro in 1999, investments by Americans would get
a boost. &QL;

   Consumer Rates Are Likely to Go Higher &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Borrower should expect to pay more in interest after the Fed
raises rates.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card, consumer and auto loans are all tied to interest
rates that tend to track Federal Reserve board actions. And even
though mortgage rates have been rising for nine months in
anticipation of higher inflation ahead, they, too, are likely to go
up even more if the Fed raises rates, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the 200 million individual credit card
accounts are at variable rates, said David Robertson, president of
The Nilson Report, a credit card newsletter published in Oxnard,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed raises rates, card holder rates can go up as soon as
the next billing cycle, which might start the next day in some
cases, or, in as long as three months time, Robertson said. Most
banks, he said, will raise rates at the very next billing cycle.
</P>
<P>
   What is less obvious is that even people with fixed-rate credit
cards may see rates rise. The fine print often allows a periodic
adjustment and many contracts allow raising the rate if a payment
is late.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot is auto loans. Some manufacturers offer very low
rates to customers with solid credit histories who buy models the
manufacturers are eager to move. DaimlerChrysler, for example, has
granted some customers five-year loans at 0.9 percent interest for
five years, below the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage interest rates have been rising for nine months in
anticipation of higher long-term inflation, said Greg McBride of
Bankrate.com, a company in North Palm Beach, Fla., that monitors
bank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates tend to rise in advance of Fed action, he said.
But even so, McBride said that mortgage rates, which are now above
8 percent for 30-year loans, may notch even higher if the market
anticipates continued increases in the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, savers are getting much
better returns, he said. The national average yield on a one-year
certificate of deposit was 5.05 percent last week, up from 4.27
percent a year ago.

   One Kind of Giving Gets More Attractive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those thinking about creating a charitable remainder trust,
the expected rise in rates may have a major impact.
</P>
<P>
   In a charitable remainder trust, an irrevocable gift is made to
charity, but the charity does not receive the funds until the giver
dies or, as charity officials like to say, when the gift
``matures.''
</P>
<P>
   The giver gets an immediate deduction for the gift, but not for
the full amount because the charity will not collect immediately.
The amount that can be deducted is based on the age of the donor or
donors and on interest rates set by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The donor gets back a stream of payments for life and can decide
how to invest the trust assets.
</P>
<P>
   The expected rise in interest rates will have virtually no
direct impact on charitable remainder unitrusts, which are
generally invested in stocks and whose value thus rises and falls
with the value of those stocks, said Leland Hoffman, president of
the Planned Giving Design Center in Matthews, N.C., an Internet
advisory service for charities.
</P>
<P>
   But rates have a big impact on charitable remainder annuity
trusts, which pay a fixed sum to the donor.
</P>
<P>
   If people donate bonds to the trust and interest rates go up,
then the bonds will be worth less, said Hoffman, who was a
co-author of ``Harnessing the Power of the Charitable Remainder
Trust'' (PhilanthroTec, Inc., 5th Edition, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   This means that people planning to finance a charitable
remainder annuity trust with bonds want to act before rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman noted, however, that the Internal Revenue Service resets
the official interest rate on the 19th of each month and that
donors are allowed to use the rate in effect two months earlier. He
recommends that appointments with estate lawyers or charity
officials to execute trust documents be set in the last 10 days of
the month to take advantage of the latest information on the
official interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gordon Hoffman, a lawyer with Hoffman Sabban &AMP; Watenmaker
in Los Angeles who is not related to the president of Planned
Giving Design Center, said that charitable remainder annuity trusts
financed with cash would generate an increasingly large deduction
as interest rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   When rates rise, the rules say that the value that eventually
goes to charity rises and that means a larger tax deduction, in
fact a far larger one.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gordon Hoffman said that a couple, both aged 65, who donate
cash to a charitable remainder annuity trust, or CRAT in industry
parlance, at the current official interest rate of 7.4 percent will
get to deduct 37.8 percent, or $378,316 for a $1 million trust,
assuming they take an annual payout of $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, he said, their
deduction will grow to 42.6 percent, or $426,616 for $1 million
trust, assuming the same $60,000 annual payout. That is 12.7
percent more, or $48,300 in the case of $1 million trust.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to get both a higher payout and a bigger deduction
if interest rates rise, however. Paul Gordon Hoffman calculated
that if the interest rate set by the IRS rises 1 percentage point
and the donor takes a payout of 7 percent, or 1 percentage point
higher, the value of the charitable deduction falls to 33.1
percent.

</P>
<P>
   A Slower Economy, But Still a Strong One &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First the good news: The economy is so strong that even a sharp
rise in interest rates this year is unlikely to stop growth in its
tracks or hit individuals too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are likely to continue creating new jobs, albeit at a
slower pace. The unemployment rate would probably creep up, but
remain at a relatively low level. Incomes would continue rising,
but perhaps more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case to be made that rate increases by the central
bank do not filter through the economy with the force they once
did. But Americans would feel the effects nonetheless, though the
full impact would not become apparent until 2001. Still, even if
the Fed raises rates by more than many expect _ say, a full
percentage point this year _ the results would not be cataclysmic
by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one percentage point increase will make housing a little
less affordable, raise debt service payments for businesses and
households, and if history is any guide it will reduce stock and
other asset values,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist at RFA Dismal
Sciences, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should also help to support the value of the dollar, which
should result in greater constraint on our trade with overseas
economies,'' Zandi said. ``When you add all those things together,
it will result in an economy that will grow more slowly, but not an
economy that will fall off a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandi plugged a 100 basis point increase in the short-term
federal funds target rate into his economic model, and found that
growth would decline to 2.5 percent in 2001 from 3.5 percent this
year. The unemployment rate would rise to 4.5 percent next year
from 4.1 percent this year. Growth in median household income would
fall to 2.6 percent from 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Zandi's forecast assumes that rising rates will take a bite
out of the stock market, dampening the so-called wealth effect that
leaves consumers feeling flush and eager to spend. If investors
were to shrug off rising rates and continue pushing equity prices
higher, the economy could retain considerably more momentum than if
the stock market declines or stays flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much hinges on a weaker stock market and the market continuing
to behave like it has historically in a rising rate environment,''
Zandi said. ``If the stock market were to move higher and disregard
the monetary tightening and higher long-term rates, then the impact
on the economy would be very small. You might have fewer homes
built, and we might export less overseas because of a stronger
dollar, but consumers would spend aggressively and business would
invest aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   As Greenspan and every Fed chairman before him has learned,
slowing the economy through interest rate increases is an imprecise
business. The main reason that expansions end is not that they grow
old and tired, but that the Fed tightens monetary policy a notch or
two too much, stamping out inflation but squeezing out growth as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that higher interest rates filter through
the economy with a lag of many months. No one knows for sure what
economic and financial conditions will be like when a rate increase
finally begins to bite.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed, as it ponders whether another increase is
justified, it is like having to know how hard to hit the brakes on
the car miles before coming to the stop sign _ and without knowing
what the traffic or weather conditions will be.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ On a snowy and slick highway, in a grubby car
packed with the paraphernalia of a political campaign, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, the Utah Republican, was racing to the next stop in his
presidential campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' said Hatch, waving a bag of cold fast-food at
five people squeezed into the car. ``Nothing fancy here. This is
the candidate's bus, the press bus, the staff bus, all rolled into
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hatch, a staunch conservative known as much for his high
shirt collars as his high moral views, is running for president
with the pitch that he is more experienced than his rivals. He is
seeking re-election to the Senate as well, but said he would give
that up if it appeared his White House dreams could turn into
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if we start taking off, I'd give up my Senate
seat,'' he said this week in an interview in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, with most polls showing Hatch getting somewhere
between zero and 2 percent of the vote in Iowa, and many voters not
even aware that he is seeking the Oval Office, there is little
chance Hatch will be forced to give up the day job he has held
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   His presence here is a sideline curiosity in a political
spectacle dominated by major candidates on both sides. Hatch, of
course, is almost a household name, but his campaign here is being
run on the tightest of shoestrings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little money, no television commercials, no newspaper
advertisements, few brochures and a staff, mainly, of unpaid
volunteers. When he appears at political debates, he is often
treated as an unexpected dinner guest _ someone who is greeted with
courtesy but who makes everyone wonder why he is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed for him at the debates,'' said Dennis
Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University. ``He
may have done the same thing Quayle did, which is to look at his
resume and think he could be a shoo-in. But it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   How shoestring is his effort? Hatch raised $1.4 million through
the end of September, according to the Federal Election Commission.
Even lesser-known Republican candidates like Gary Bauer, who raised
$6.3 million over the same period, or Alan Keyes, who raised $2.5
million, have bigger war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the two financial gorillas in the
Republican race, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has spent $20
million out of his $57 million war chest, and Steve Forbes, who has
spent $25 million of his own money, so far, and raised $6 million
more. (Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is not campaigning in Iowa,
has raised $9.5 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and his staff admit that the best they are hoping for here
is a fourth-place showing. Third place, they say, is well beyond
their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Orrin Hatch came in third place in the Iowa caucuses, that
would be bigger news than George Bush winning,'' said James Camp,
Hatch's national political director. ``The headlines would not be
that Bush wins, but that Hatch takes third.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hatch said his goal was to ``do fourth or better.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Hatch campaign is depending heavily on local
newspaper interviews and small-town radio call-in and television
talk shows to spread his word, since those things cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the unusual combination of being a national figure and
having nearly nonexistent poll ratings has led to some odd
juxtapositions on Hatch's campaign schedule. On the same day he
drove across dangerously icy roads to be interviewed by The Daily
Nonpareil in Council Bluffs, The Marshalltown Times-Republican and
The Mason City Globe-Gazette, he also appeared on CNN's Equal Time
on a live feed from Des Moines, bantering with the anchor Greta Van
Susteren, and later on MSNBC's ``News with Brian Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending 18 hours a day, going to all these towns,''
said Camp, as he pointed to a map of Iowa with red pins snaking
over it, ``and we go to every newspaper, every radio station. We
don't have the money to compete with paid advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, however, did prepare a 28-minute video, made 10,000
copies for distribution, and hawked it at his appearance at the
last Republican debate here. To the groans and laughter of the
audience, Hatch told the crowd at least four times that his video
would be broadcast ``tonight on Channel 5 and Channel 8 at 6 and
6:30.'' Two times, he got the station identifications wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To his great disappointment, Iowa's ample Mormon population _
around 16,500, according to the church's Salt Lake City
headquarters _ is giving Hatch, himself a Mormon, little help with
money or support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just not political and that's the problem,'' Hatch
said. ``If I had to depend on my fellow Mormon, I would not have
come this far.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hatch came to Des Moines this week and spoke to 50 employees
at the Principal Financial Group, an insurance company. He made his
standard pitch: He has more experience than his Republican rivals
and none of them was talking about the low moral standards of the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking, talk-show style, on the same level as the audience
rather than from the stage, Hatch attacked his opponents: ``How
many of those people have the experience, yes, the knowledge and
the ability to work with Congress and really fulfill all those
campaign promises?'' Hatch asked. ``I understand Congress to the
last person. I passed 43 bills in the last Congress. Sure, I can't
get everything passed, but Orrin Hatch will die trying.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Democrats in the race, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, were `'far left and you better
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to tell if Hatch won any converts. Jack Croft
said that while ``I liked what he said on our need for more
military readiness,'' he was not swayed enough to vote for Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because he's a giant in the Senate,'' said David
Holzinger, who added that he was trying to decide between Hatch and
Forbes. ``I like what he said on the ethics of the Clinton
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy McNamar came because ``I'm curious,'' she said, adding:
``I'm still trying to sort it out. I'm an equal opportunity
voter.''

   MUSCATINE, Iowa _ A day after he disclosed that he has suffered
four incidents of irregular heart beats during the past month,
former Sen. Bill Bradley sought to assure voters in Iowa Friday
that the condition was just ``a nuisance'' that would not affect
his ability to campaign for president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush had the same thing,'' Bradley told about 80 voters
in this Mississippi River town, referring to the former president.
``You can call any doctor or cardiologist, and they'll assure you
this is a very common condition and it has absolutely no impact on
your ability to campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctor, in an interview, said the recent irregular
heartbeats were not significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These episodes have not caused Bradley any symptoms, and they
have not lasted long,'' said the physician, Dr. J. Thomas Bigger of
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with his heart functionally or
structurally,'' and there has been no change in his condition, said
Bigger, who is a leading national expert in abnormal heart rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has a condition known as atrial fibrillation, which
occasionally causes his heart to flutter to an irregular beat. More
than 2 million Americans have the syndrome, which is not considered
dangerous. Bradley takes medication daily to keep his heart beating
regularly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a packed day of campaigning in towns along the
Mississippi River Friday, Bradley looked relaxed and in good humor,
despite the intense attention being focused on his condition just
three days before the Iowa caucuses, the first vote of the primary
season. His schedule even included some bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the recent incidents occurred just before or after
debates with his lone rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice
President Al Gore. But Bigger discounted the role of stress and
exhaustion as triggers in Bradley's irregular heartbeat. ``One
man's stress is another's pleasure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said his condition had not forced changes in his
schedule. They said he conducted a nationally televised interview
with CBS News while his heart was palpitating earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger said he and Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel, Bradley's
personal physician, have not identified any specific trigger for
the bouts of atrial fibrillation. ``we haven't come up with a
pattern,'' Bigger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered his own theory about the increased frequency of
his arrhythmia in recent weeks: caffeinated soda. Bradley said
that, at the urging of his doctors, he had cut out all caffeine
from his diet. But beginning in December, he said, he began
drinking cream soda, not realizing it contains caffeine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I shared this with the doctor, and he thought this might have
contributed to it,'' Bradley said, adding that he is back to
drinking orange soda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, first publicly disclosed he had atrial fibrillation
on Dec. 10, when he canceled campaign events in California and went
to a hospital after his heart remained out of rhythm for 24 hours.
He discovered he had the problem in 1996, and experienced six bouts
of irregular heart beat before Dec. 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Bradley's own assessment, four incidents in one month was an
unusually high number. In all four of those cases, Bradley's heart
reverted to a normal beat without medical treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley disclosed his most recent palpitations when a reporter
asked one of his aides about his heart condition on Thursday. He
explained Friday that the public only needed to know when he
required medical attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm sick in my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick in
my stomach?'' Bradley said. ``If I don't sleep well at night, do I
have to tell you I don't sleep well at night? I think that there is
a reasonable way to proceed here, and that is the way we have tried
to do it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of answering the question, Bradley also
acknowledged having concerns that his condition could divert public
attention away from his campaign message. ``Am I supposed to say,
well it's out, now it's back in,'' he said. ``Everyday I say that,
we have a press conference like this, and we say the same
things.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's condition was the subject of a front-page article in
the morning Hawkeye, a local paper here, as well as evening and
morning news programs on the local television stations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some voters who came to see Bradley Friday said they had been
troubled by these reports. But almost all of them also said they
felt better about his condition after seeing him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he reassures me he's in good health, I believe
him,'' said Bonnie Weeks, 66, of Wapello, who asked Bradley about
his condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Weeks, a strong supporter of Bradley's, expressed
worries that Bradley's health would remain an issue for some voters
in the campaign. ``I think it will be a concern because when you
elect a president, you want him to be in good health,'' she said.

 &HT;    Four vs. Jacksonville, but Rolle's not counting
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Samari Rolle should be seeing the play in his
dreams. At least in his daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolle, who sealed the Sept. 26 victory over Jacksonville
with his end-zone interception of a Mark Brunell pass, says he
can't relive the first pick of his career for reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so long ago,'' Rolle said, smiling. ``I don't even
remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't,'' the Titans cornerback said. ``I remember it
was raining and the game was coming to an end, and I thought they'd
play it safe and go for overtime. I happened to make a play. And we
won. I think that kind of gave us confidence for this year, but I
don't even think about it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for his other three interceptions this season, all
against the Jaguars. He had the triple, tying the NFL single-game
record, in Dec. 26's 41-14 win, one off Brunell and two off backup
Jay Fiedler. He also had four tackles and defended four passes.
Marcus Robertson calls Rolle ``The Jacksonville Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a myth,'' Rolle said. ``I'm not into that.
That's just locker room talk. What I did the past two games _ what
we did the past two games _ really doesn't mean anything. Because
if we go down there and lose, then our season's over. And nobody's
ready for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't think the Jaguars are dwelling on his
achievements, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacksonville is going to do what they've been doing all year
long, and what gave them the best record in the NFL,'' he said.
``And that's a tribute to them. It really doesn't matter (what I
did). They're going to stick with what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-year defender from Florida State also played a key
role last week against Indianapolis. Tennessee changed its defense
in the second half, putting Rolle man-to-man on Marcus Harrison.
After halftime, Harrison had three catches for 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rolle's teammates have given him a hard time because he
has no interceptions against any team other than Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always,'' he said of the constant ribbing. ``But I'm used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolle is thankful to still be playing. The 6-foot, 175-pounder
had a close call during training camp in 1998 when he suffered a
contusion to his spinal cord and couldn't feel his left side for
several hours. Rolle missed the final three preseason games and
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   He started one game last year and all 18 this season. Rolle said
he doesn't mind that the Titans' defense has been dubbed ``Jevon
(Kearse) and the nobodies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten this far with that attitude,'' Rolle said, ``and
of course, Jevon and Blaine (Bishop) are probably the best two
players on our defense, so they deserve all the credit they get. It
just happens to be a lot of guys get overshadowed. But we don't
have any guys that are jealous or have envy, so that's fine.''

 &HT;    Rookie King doesn't act like one
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some Tampa Bay players might be nervous about Sunday's
NFC Championship matchup with St. Louis. Shaun King isn't one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   During practices this week, King has acted more like a 10-year
veteran than a wide-eyed rookie quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   During his first official news conference early in the week,
King started his interview session by taking a microphone and
singing to a large group of newspaper and TV media.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was the best singer on the team, King
smiled and answered, ``Come on, look who I'm going against.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Sapp laughed when he heard the story. ``I definitely
can't hold a note in a bucket, so I will give (best voice) to
him,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is just something special,'' he said. ``If that's his
way of going about things, then let's do it. We have supreme
confidence that he's going to get the job done, and he knows we
think he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to carry myself in a way that's easy-going and easy to
get along with my teammates,'' King said. ``I'm enjoying this week.
It's fun. You never know how many opportunities you'll have to get
this far again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie hasn't shown a hint of nervousness during practices
this week. His teammates say he has been that way since joining the
Bucs during the summer as a touted draft choice. King didn't flinch
when he was named starting quarterback for the Bucs' final six
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a confident brother,'' Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber
said. ``He is loose every day, and we have seen that from him ever
since he got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp said he can tell that King is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning this week, he is asking to fight me _ so I know
he's all right,'' Sapp said with a chuckle. ``As long as Shaun is
threatening me, then I know everything is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   King has won five of his six starts. He struggled in the first
half in last weekend's divisional playoff game but rallied the team
from a 13-0 deficit to edge the Washington Redskins 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an NFL quarterback,'' Washington cornerback Darrell
Green said about King. ``I didn't see a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't frustrating with the way I played last week, because
we won,'' King said. ``Nah, I didn't play good in the first half.
For us to win Sunday, I'm going to have to play better. It is that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   King was the first rookie quarterback to start a playoff game
since 1991, and the first to win in the postseason since Pat Haden
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   No first-year quarterback has started a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way are the St. Louis Rams, led by quarterback
Kurt Warner, the NFL's Most Valuable Player. The Rams are favored
by 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard it as a challenge going against (Warner); he's
great,'' King said. ``But my goal is to just go out, have fun, see
how many plays I can make and not turn the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching it as any other game. No jitters _ just go out
and have fun. Nobody expects us to win, anyway, so we don't have
anything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   King has been surrounded by autograph-seeking children all week.
To the youngsters, King is a bigger star than Warren Sapp or
Warrick Dunn. King is more than a Tampa Bay Buccaneer; he's a local
hero who grew up in the Tampa area.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked toward the locker room, King was asked if he saw
NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw watching him in
practice earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he really here today?'' King asked with a look of
amazement on his face. ``Wow! I guess that means we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time this week King acted like a rookie.

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban shipwreck survivor who has been living with relatives in
Miami and caught for months in the eye of an international custody
storm, flew to New York from Havana Friday and made a poignant
appeal for the motherless boy's return to his homeland and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask all of you who want to help us _ if you want to help us,
help us return Elian home,'' Raquel Rodriguez, the boy's maternal
grandmother, pleaded in Spanish as tears welled in her eyes at a
crowded, raucous news conference at Kennedy International Airport.
``I want that my daughter will be in peace, and she will not be in
peace until Elian is home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, was almost
pugnacious in response to a question about a move in Congress to
resolve the tug of war by legislating citizenship for Elian. ``No
one has a right to make him an American citizen,'' she said. ``He
was born in Cuba. He lives in Cuba. He's a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, who have occasionally appeared at
demonstrations in Cuba calling for the boy's return, said they had
spoken often to Elian by telephone and insisted that he had
expressed a desire to return to his father and family in Cuba. The
boy's relatives in Miami scoffed at the assertion, insisting that
he had said repeatedly that he wanted to stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that has divided a family, generated demonstrations in
the streets of Miami and Havana, reached into America's courts and
the presidential race and been turned into crusades by President
Fidel Castro in Cuba and anti-Castro expatriates in Florida, the
grandmothers' mission added yet another dimension Friday, but the
fate of the boy seemed as uncertain as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in the Caribbean on Nov. 25 after the
small boat on which he had been bound for Florida capsized, killing
his mother, Elisabet Brotons Rodriguez, and 10 others. The boy's
relatives in Miami have sought to keep him, arguing that he would
have a better life in the United States. But his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded his return.
</P>
<P>
   An order by American immigration officials for the boy's return
to Cuba has been blocked by a lawsuit in federal court in Miami,
and scores of legislators, clergy members and others have joined
the battle, which has become highly politicized.
</P>
<P>
   It was with that in mind that the grandmothers flew to New York
Friday to appeal directly to the American people. Arriving at 3:30
p.m. with a delegation from the National Council of Churches who
support their cause, the grandmothers winced in the 16 degree cold
as they stepped off a chartered Lear jet in trench coats, and were
quickly ushered through Customs in a VIP lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired after their journey and somewhat intimidated by a
tumultuous reception, the women were soon confronted by 40
television cameras, a blaze of flashbulbs and 100 reporters from
around the world at a news conference that erupted frequently in
shouting matches among journalists in a circus atmosphere that
reflected the tensions of the case and competitiveness of the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But, speaking through an interpreter at a session broadcast live
on several national cable networks, the grandmothers, who live in
Cardenas, a city on Cuba's north coast 90 miles east of Havana,
responded to questions with simple phrases that sounded broken in
translation but conveyed passion, pride and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this
tragedy that has been so hard on us as a family, and to ask that
our grandson can return as soon as possible,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Rodriguez spoke of a desire to preserve the memory of
her daughter. ``We feel that the best way to keep that memory is
for Elian to come back with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The women had been persuaded to come to New York by a delegation
of clergy members. They were escorted to the United States and
introduced by the Rev. Dr. Robert W. Edgar, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, who was a member of the House of
Representatives from Pennsylvania from 1974 to 1987 and is the
president of the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He called the grandmothers courageous, and said it was their
hope to return home in a few days with Elian. ``We believe in
miracles,'' he said when asked how that might happen. The
grandmothers, who were whisked away after the news conference to an
undisclosed location, wanted to meet with legislators and others
who might help them, including Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers said they had no plans to go to Miami, where
Cuban exiles have staged demonstrations against Fidel Castro and
the return of Elian Gonzalez, choosing instead to take their
message to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives said the grandmothers were
welcome to visit him there but would not be allowed to take him
back to Cuba. And one suggested that the Cuban government was
behind the grandmothers' trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some
degree,'' said Spencer Eig, who filed a lawsuit in federal court in
Miami on Wednesday on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez. The suit asked a federal judge to prevent the Immigration
and Naturalization Service from returning the boy to Cuba before
granting him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the judge assigned to the case, James
Lawrence King, recused himself Friday after disclosing potential
conflicts of interest. He noted that his daughter was a federal
prosecutor in Miami and that his son, Miami-Dade County Judge
Lawrence B. King, had hired as a campaign consultant a man now
working as a spokesman for the boy's relatives in Miami. The case
was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of the former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   There were other pronouncements on the case by members of
Congress. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said
the Senate would act as early as next Wednesday to make Elian an
American citizen, an unusual step ordinarily used to honor
prominent people _ Winston Churchill, for one.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans hope that citizenship will safeguard
the boy's rights and aid his Miami relatives in their legal fight
to keep him. Asked in a taped television appearance whether the
action was intended to aid George W. Bush's presidential election
bid, Lott said: ``We don't want it to be a political football. We
want to have a determination made about what is best for the young
boy.''

 Wells Fargo Ending Calls to Analysts  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Under government pressure to give small shareholders equal access
to market-moving information, Wells Fargo has decided to
discontinue its quarterly conference calls with Wall Street
analysts and institutional investors.
<P>
   Wells holds these calls after it reports earnings. While many
companies let ordinary shareholders listen to such calls, some
companies, including Wells, restrict them to Wall Street insiders
who get the first chance to trade stock on information that leaks
out.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' move, reported yesterday by the online news service
TheStreet.com, comes several weeks after the Securities and
Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would prohibit companies
from feeding market-moving information to analysts and
institutional investors without also alerting the public. The
practice is known as selective disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokesman Larry Haeg said the bank is canceling its
calls ``to ensure we continue to comply with SEC disclosure
requirements.'' Haeg said the bank is looking at other ways to
convey earnings commentary to all categories of investors, such as
distributing recorded remarks of executives.
</P>
<P>
   Market experts said Wells' explanation makes little sense. ``Are
they afraid a bunch of blue-haired ladies'' will disrupt the calls,
asked Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Campbell Chaney. He noted that the bank
could obey the SEC rule by opening its calls to all investors, as
hundreds of other companies do.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Golden State Bancorp, the parent of California
Federal Bank, lets small investors listen to its calls over the
Internet. Only investment professionals can ask questions, but any
shareholder can hear the responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a technical solution,'' said Golden State investor
relations chief Fred Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Although selective disclosure is diminishing, companies used to
routinely hand valuable information to an elite group of investment
insiders at closed forums, such as conference calls and private
meetings. For example, analysts regularly ask company officials
whether they are ``comfortable`` with earnings estimates, and
adjust their projections accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   If the information is hot enough, big investors can trade and
analysts can advise their clients before other market participants
know what's happening. The result can be a big move up or down in
the stock while small investors scamble to find out what's going
on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the shares of pizza restaurant Papa John's
International fell almost 22 percent on December 9 after the
company told some analysts it expected Christmas season sales to
fall short of expectations. The company didn't make the news public
until after the market closed, Bloomberg News reported.

 _ SF CHRON  
 On the Web, Everyone's a Critic  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; In the beginning, there was Usenet, that pre-Internet collection
of newsgroups where you could read anyone's opinion on anything, as
long as you were interested in the point of view of computer nerds
who were busy configuring their modems while the rest of us were
discovering MTV.
<P>
   Now that the Net is mainstream, the opinions of a broad range of
people _ parents, skateboarders and dog breeders, for example _ are
being collected, organized and presented by a number of Web sites
that hope to lead consumers from thinking about buying something to
actually making a purchase. Online stores like Amazon.com have been
incorporating user reviews of books and other products for some
time, but product rating sites like the Bay Area's Productopia and
Epinions.com hope to attract users first for the content, then
inspire them to buy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first companies to harness the power of consumer
opinion online was Zagat, a New York travel guide that
ratesrestaurants, hotels and other travel products according to
survey results. They took their guides online through Prodigy and
Compuserve in the early 1990s. Today, Zagat.com lists restaurants
that survey respondents liked the best in 29 U.S. cities and areas,
and a few international cities as well. Later this year, they plan
to branch out into other travel categories, such as the spas and
hotels covered in their books.
</P>
<P>
   User opinion sites are multiplying because they recognize that
consumers value hearing from people like themselves as opposed to
expert opinions, said Carolyn Everson, Zagat.com vice president of
business development.
</P>
<P>
   But why would you want to hear what someone's Uncle Joe thinks
of his cellular phone when you can read a professional's view at
Cnet or in Consumer Reports?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to gather expert opinions on every single
product under the sun,'' reasoned Ken Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``(Companies like) Epinions and
Deja.com want to be able to talk about every product there is so we
will think of them every time they have a question about a
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Productopia tries to cover all the bases by combining expert and
amateur advice on its site. Look up the Schwinn Mesa GSX mountain
bike and you'll find a report based on interviews with experts, a
review written by a user, and an invitation to rate and review the
bike yourself. However, many of the products listed don't have any
user comments, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Deja News, a company that started in 1995 to provide Web-based
access to Usenet newsgroups, re- &LR; launched its Web site in May 1999
as a product review destination.
</P>
<P>
   While simply archiving newsgroups, Deja News ``wasn't growing as
a business,'' spokeswoman Lisa Lahde said from Deja.com's New York
headquarters. So they hired a new CEO, Tom Phillips, who moved the
company in the direction of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Deja.com still taps into Usenet discussion groups. If you look
up the user reviews for the BMW 740il and still can't decide if
that's the sports car for you, Deja.com sends you to the
alt.auto.bmw Usenet group.
</P>
<P>
   But Lahde said the site isn't finished evolving _ later this
month it will morph into a shopping portal with shopping tools and
links directly to reviewed products on its e-commerce partners' Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the consumer opinion sites _ including
ConsumerReview.com, RateItAll.com, Deja.com and Zagat.com _ take a
product's consumer ratings and aggregate them into a single
percentage or average rating so you can compare one item to
another. You may not trust just one nonexpert about which
toothpaste makes your teeth the whitest, but if 9 out of 10
nonexperts agree, it's probably worth buying.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: On ABC's hit game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' asking the audience almost always gets a right
answer.

   PAKISTAN: SHARIF ACCUSED OF JAIL PLOT
</P>
<P>
   A complaint lodged with the police in Karachi accuses former
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, toppled in a coup in October, of
plotting a jailbreak with two other former government officials,
the police confirmed. The complaint is the first step of a police
investigation, but a lawyer for Sharif said, ``He is innocent and
does not need to run away from the prison.'' The three are to go on
trial on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA: PAKISTAN ACCUSED
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee accused Pakistan of
supporting separatist militants in India's northeast states at a
conference in Shillong, capital of the northeast state of
Meghalaya. ``It is now well established that Pakistan is backing
some of these groups as part of its larger game plan to try and
destabilize India,'' he said. Vajpayee has also asserted that
Pakistan was behind the hijacking of an Indian airliner last month.

   NORTH KOREA, U.S.: TALKS ON SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   American and North Korean negotiators will meet in Berlin on
Saturday to try to prepare the groundwork for the first high-level
visit by North Korean officials to the United States. The meeting
will build on the positive outcome of the last round of talks in
Berlin in November. Washington said last year that it was easing
sanctions in exchange for North Korea's pledge to restrain its
missile and nuclear programs.

   RUSSIA: 9 POLES EXPELLED
</P>
<P>
   A furious Kremlin replied in kind to Poland's expulsion of nine
Russian diplomats it said were spies, ordering nine Polish
diplomats to vacate Poland's embassy in Moscow. Russian officials
called the action an ``unfriendly'' provocation inspired by Western
powers; the Poles said they had detailed proof that the Russians
were spying.

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET MEDICAL PLEA
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the British Medical Association's ethics
committee said Britain should make public the medical records on
which it based its decision that Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, was
unfit to stand trial on torture charges. Home Secretary Jack Straw
says he is keeping them confidential on legal advice. A decision
allowing the former Chilean dictator to return home is expected
next week.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: CELLPHONE WARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   The government began showing stark television commercials
recreating an accident in which a pedestrian was killed by a
motorist using a mobile telephone. ``Stay switched on. Switch it
off'' the ads say, cautioning drivers wanting to use their phones
to pull over first. There are 24 million mobile phones in use in
Britain.

<P>
   NORWAY: JOURNALIST CALLED SPY
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian journalist has been charged with spying for the
former East Germany and is at large ``somewhere in Europe,'' his
newspaper, Aftenbladet, said. Stein Viksveen, the paper's Brussels
correspondent, is accused of delivering secret NATO documents to
Stasi intelligence agents from 1962 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN: PAPAL MARRIAGE WARNING
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II warned members of the Vatican's highest appeals
court that the church should not grant annulments easily, and
warned that even he could not dissolve a marriage made correctly
before God. The church does not recognize divorce, considering
marriage bonds sacred and unbreakable, but many Catholics can get
annulments if a church court agrees that their marriage was not
consummated or had other irregularities recognized in canon law.

   The new national police chief, the first black in the post, will
not be charged with criminal defamation for calling a police
sergeant a chimpanzee. Commissioner Jackie Selebi was apparently
angry at how the sergeant, a black woman, treated him at a Pretoria
police station. A police watchdog group, which recommended against
prosecution, suggested that Selebi be counseled on how to deal with
employees.

</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has agreed to help Nigeria recover assets of the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Some $645 million in accounts in

systematically plundered the central bank.

DOCTOR WHO CARVED INITIALS ON WOMAN CITES BRAIN DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Liana Gedz was wheeled into an operating room at
Beth Israel Hospital in September, she had every reason to trust
Dr. Allan Zarkin in delivering her first child.
</P>
<P>
   He had coached her through seven months of prenatal care, and
the two had developed a friendship that one lawyer described as
``more than a doctor-patient relationship.'' It was the kind of
bond that led Dr. Gedz, a dentist, to invite Zarkin, 61, to spend
summer nights with her and her husband at their country home in
East Northport, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 8, the day after undergoing a Caesarean section
that delivered a healthy girl, Dr. Gedz held a mirror up to her
stomach in a recovery room and discovered that Zarkin had carved
his initials, AZ, into her abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a branded animal,'' Dr. Gedz said at a news
conference Thursday after The Daily News reported the incident.
``It was supposed to be one of the most exciting times in my life,
but it was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating
``a range of incidents'' at Beth Israel related to Zarkin, law
enforcement officials said. Those incidents include not only the
treatment of Dr. Gedz, but also Zarkin's handling of other patients
and remarks he is said to have made in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the state Department of Health is conducting
its own investigation into Zarkin, whose license was suspended two
weeks ago because of the carving incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to permanently preclude him from practicing
medicine,'' said Kristine Smith, a Health Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation comes at a sensitive time for Beth Israel. In
1998, state health officials fined the hospital for the death of a
patient undergoing a standard tumor removal in 1997, citing faulty
surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work at Beth Israel, Zarkin worked at a
practice in Murray Hill called New York Gyn/Ob Associates, whose
partners said they acted quickly after hearing about the carving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this act occurred, when we found out about it, we did
some small investigations but fired him immediately,'' said Dr.
Howard Berk, a partner who refused to comment on Zarkin's
character. ``We have been disassociated with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel suspended Zarkin immediately after the incident, and
he later resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gedz and her husband, Dr. Robert Ghalili, have named Beth
Israel, Zarkin and New York Gyn/Ob Associates as defendants in a
$5.5-million civil lawsuit, charging that ``severe, permanent and
devastating personal injuries'' were ``caused by the carelessness,
negligence and medical malpractice of the defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Dr. Gedz and Ghalili, an oral surgeon, said
that the carving deprived Ghalili of the ``services, society,
affection and consortium'' of his wife. Dr. Gedz has said that she
is embarrassed to undress in front of her husband because another
man's initials are carved into her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have to decide whether to have major plastic surgery or
live with this branding for the rest of my life,'' Dr. Gedz said.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin and his lawyer, Kenneth Platzer, have asked the court to
dismiss the suit, saying that Zarkin's actions ``were caused by
medical incapacity/cerebral dysfunction and not the result of any
negligent, willful or intentional conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Platzer said that Zarkin was suffering from Pick's disease, a
frontal lobe dementia similar to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin had worked at Beth Israel for 13 years. The hospital has
120 doctors on its obstetrics and gynecology staff, and delivered
about 5,500 babies in 1998. Before hiring a doctor for that
department, the hospital checks background and references, then
gives limited operating room privileges at the start, a hospital
official said. Before September, the hospital had never placed
Zarkin on probation, and the state Health Department had taken no
disciplinary action against him.
</P>
<P>
   As Zarkin carved his initials into Dr. Gedz, nurses assisting in
the procedure screamed at him to stop, then ran out to get
administrators, the hospital said in a written statement. ``Beth
Israel is appalled by the conduct of Zarkin, and has been working
cooperatively, from the outset, with the patient and her family,''
the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state Health Department fined Beth Israel $30,000
after finding that flaws in operating room procedures led to the
death of Lisa Smart, a patient undergoing a tumor removal, in 1997.
But state health officials said the case of Zarkin was most likely
unrelated to any previous infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Zarkin didn't have any prior disciplinary actions, so
that's not something the hospital could have identified,'' said Ms.
Smith, the state Health Department spokeswoman. ``And they did
promptly report the grossly inappropriate action on the part of
this physician.''

IRELAND AND U.S. MAY HAVE LOST CHANCE TO LEARN OF TERRORIST PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)   (jw)  
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Dec. 21, Irish police raided a house in
a working-class section of Dublin as part of a series of sweeps
that rounded up five North African immigrants for questioning as
tensions grew about possible acts of terror during new year's
celebrations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But officers released the men after about 24 hours, saying there
was insufficient evidence to hold them, said Barbara Scarlett, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Then within days, authorities in Ireland and the United States
began to realize that they might have missed a chance to learn more
about a terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now say that an analysis of documents and a computer
seized in the raids show that one of the men, Hamid Aich, perhaps
had ties to an Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested in Seattle
on Dec. 14 after military explosives and homemade detonators were
found in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Irish authorities, aware that Ressam had been arrested when he
tried to cross into the United States from Canada, decided to
question the handful of Algerian and Libyan immigrants in Dublin.
American officials said they asked the Irish to detain the group
until a determination could be made about their potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   Neither American nor Irish law enforcement officials would speak
publicly about the circumstances surrounding Aich's release,
although Ms. Scarlett acknowledged that Aich had been detained and
released with the knowledge of U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, American law enforcement officials made it
clear they were disappointed that they were unable to question Aich
or fully explore his ties to Ressam. They are still reviewing
information in his computer, hoping that it may explain Ressam's
plans for the explosives hidden in the wheel well of his car, his
possible accomplices and any broader organization or group that may
have sponsored the plot. No criminal charges have been brought
against Aich, FBI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator said some material on the computer suggested
that Aich had ties to the Egyptian group Islamic Jihad, which has
targeted tourists and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials would not say whether they
suspected that Aich was directly involved in the plot involving
Ressam nor would they detail the possible ties between him and
Ressam found on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   But one official said he hoped that the ongoing analysis of the
computer and documents would prove valuable to the FBI in its
efforts to unravel what investigators believe was a terrorist plot
to set off as many as four bombs somewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Aich, a 34-year-old Algerian who American
law enforcement officials said had been in Canada, where Ressam had
been living before his arrest. One law enforcement official said
Aich had stayed at the same Vancouver address as Abdel Hakim
Tizegha, another figure in the Seattle investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A former counterterrorism official said that Aich had been
picked up in Dublin at the suggestion of a Western intelligence
agency and that the sweep was part of new procedures set in place
after the Aug. 7, 1997, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. Under the guidelines, police officers around the world
question suspected terrorists and search their homes in an effort
to forestall any possible planned attacks, and focus on seizing
computers or other material that may provide clues to possible
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The raids in Ireland were part of a series of sweeps around the
world last month, from Canada and New York, to Jordan and other
parts of Europe, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Special Branch detectives from a unit that investigates
fundamentalist terrorist groups detained Aich in the working-class
South Dublin suburb of Talaght and questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   Irish officials would not discuss the raids or Aich, saying only
that the police in that country had acted properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied everything was done appropriately,'' said
Eamonn McKee, a spokesman for the Irish Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in Washington and New York would not comment on
Aich.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said the Central Intelligence Agency had
alerted counterparts in Ireland to the significance of the group,
but declined to specify whether the roundup was done at
Washington's request. It was not clear whether Irish authorities
had a clear picture of Aich's significance or possible ties to
Islamic militants.

<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's board of directors met Friday to consider
stepping up merger talks with two pharmaceutical giants, American
Home Products and Warner-Lambert, that would create one of the
world's largest consumer products and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   As with any negotiations, no deal is guaranteed. And it was not
clear Friday night whether the Procter &AMP; Gamble board would decide
to pursue talks with either of the companies. But several people
close to the talks said they anticipated that the board would allow
the three companies to continue discussions that started this week.
Executives for all three companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, maker of Tide and Pampers, is already the
nation's largest consumer products company, and has a
pharmaceuticals business that is dwarfed by those of the big drug
companies. If Procter &AMP; Gamble combined all three pharmaceutical
businesses, the new drug business would be the second-largest
prescription drug seller in the United States. Only Glaxo
SmithKline, the company created by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham, which announced their intentions to merge on Monday, would
sell more prescription drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street reacted nervously. Procter &AMP; Gamble's stock fell
9 percent Friday, to $102.6875, one of the biggest drops in the
stock since the market plunge of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a merger with two drug giants would be a dramatic
departure for a historically conservative company. Procter &AMP; Gamble
would be betting that it could apply its powerful marketing and
distribution methods to help the pharmaceutical firms do a better
job of selling their products, which can carry a higher profit
margin than other consumer products. Warner-Lambert's products
include Lipitor, the cholesterol-reducing drug that is expected to
become the largest-selling drug in the world, as well as Trident
gum and Schick razors; American Home's include Advil, Robitussin
and and Premarin, a hormone replacement drug.
</P>
<P>
   American Home and Warner-Lambert announced that they would merge
in a $78 billion stock deal last November. But Pfizer Inc., a
competitor that makes Viagra and Zoloft, made a hostile bid for
Warner-Lambert in November with the hope of wresting that company
from its embrace with American Home.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Steele, a consumer products analyst at Banc of
America Securities, said that a deal with the two drug companies
would satisfy some aspects of what Procter &AMP; Gamble executives
consider important when looking at possible acquisitions. That
includes gaining high-technology research operations and the
application of its marketing and distribution skills in another
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense that Procter and Gamble would look at this
deal,'' Steele said.

NEW YORK CITY NOTES A PLUNGE IN AUTO THEFTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has not been the cars vanishing lately in New York
City. It has been the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, as crime declined throughout the city,
none of the major felonies tracked by the Police Department _ not
murder, not rape, not robbery and not assault _ fell as sharply as
auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 147,000 cars were reported stolen in the city in 1990,
one for every 12 registered here. Last year, 39,000 auto thefts
were reported, a decline of almost 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are still more likely to have their cars stolen than
residents of most other cities in the nation, and chop-shop crews
and organized-crime rings that ship stolen cars overseas persist.
But law enforcement and insurance experts say technological
advances and crime-fighting strategies have converged with such
success that thieves managed to steal fewer cars in New York last
year than at any time since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Three factors have contributed to the reversal, experts said:
the development of better anti-theft devices for higher priced cars
and sport utility vehicles, a police crackdown on chop-shop ``steal
men'' and ``cutters,'' and the more aggressive prosecution of those
who are caught.
</P>
<P>
   For some new models, the reason for much of the decline is
clear. Many top-of-the-line vehicles sold these days are equipped
with immobilizer devices, computer chips in the keys that are
required for ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles equipped with these devices cannot be started by
jimmying open the steering column to bypass the ignition lock.
Studies by the Highway Loss Data Institute show that immobilizers
have slashed theft rates for certain models by as much as 50
percent. They are now standard in many high-end vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say much of the trend in New York has been spurred by
applying law enforcement strategies long used against organized
crime and narcotics rings to fight car-theft operations. Police and
prosecutors created special squads of investigators, made more
frequent use of wiretaps, stings and undercover surveillance, and
executed more search warrants than in years past.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have made a point since the mid-1990s of
vigorously questioning every thief caught by patrol officers. The
goal has been to find those willing to implicate chop-shop owners
and provide fodder for future investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In the prosecutors' offices, assistant district attorneys have
moved auto-theft cases to a higher priority, allowing fewer thieves
to plead guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges. The goal,
prosecutors said, is to ensure felony convictions so that repeat
offenders can be sentenced to state prison.

 &HT;    White not unknown anymore
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Tampa Bay defensive end Steve White was never
confused with famous University of Tennessee alumnus Reggie White
when he played for the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But the fourth-year veteran has taken his game to another level
during the past couple of games. White was named NFC Defensive
Player of the Week after getting seven tackles, two sacks for 20
yards in losses and one caused fumble against the Washington
Redskins in the NFC divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve White is playing the game the way it is supposed to be
played,'' teammate Warren Sapp said. ``Steve has stepped up in the
last couple of games when we needed him to, and I expect him to do
it again this Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   White will be heavily counted upon in the NFC Championship.
Sapp, the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, probably will be
double-teamed often by the St. Louis Rams. Sapp also has been
spotted limping in practice this week after suffering a right
hamstring strain against Washington, but has desperately tried to
downplay the injury.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the season, White earned a spot in the
starting lineup and showed flashes of brilliance before suffering a
right sprain ankle that took a half-dozen games to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was playing pretty well for us earlier in the year,''
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said. ``He was very consistent and did
some good things the first few weeks. He really did get slowed down
by these foot injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a lot of confidence in Steve. Obviously, that
is why we made some of the personnel decisions the way we did. The
times Steve has played with us, he has played well.''
</P>
<P>
   White had a less than spectacular career at Tennessee, finally
nailing down a starting position his senior year. He was signed as
a rookie free agent by the Buccaneers in 1996, and spent the past
thee years as a stalwart on special teams and emergency starter on
the defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy that would spell people a year ago,'' White
said. ``He played well when he was in. The question was, could he
do it at 45-50 plays instead of 20? We all felt Steve could do the
job. In all the games he has played, he has been very productive.''
</P>
<P>
   The rising play of White has been noticeable to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive lineman) Brad Culpepper used to be our unsung hero,
but now it's Steve,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY NIGHT ARRIVAL
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers left from Raymond James Stadium in front of a
frenzy of fans Friday afternoon. The team headed for the airport
and flew to St. Louis. Other than an evening news conference that
required the presence of Dungy, Sapp, quarterback Shaun King,
fullback Mike Alstott and linebacker Derrick Brooks, the other
players were off.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Tampa, Dungy said the magnitude of the game
hadn't sunk in yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably will happen once we get to St. Louis and you
have a little time to slow down Friday night and think about it,''
Dungy said. ``But, really, what we've done is said, `Hey, this is
another game and this is how we have to prepare.' It really hasn't
hit me yet; I don't know about the players.''
</P>
<P>
   ARTIFICIAL FEARS
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, who play their home games on grass, consider it a joke
when it's suggested they will have problems on artificial turf
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turf won't be anything different for us,'' Dungy said. ``We
play on the turf every year against Minnesota, Detroit and other
teams. We have some guys that play better on turf, so we think it
will help us in some ways.''

 &HT;    Rain won't slow down hearty Jags
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The Jacksonville Jaguars promise not to
wilt in whatever conditions are presented to them. But with about a
50 percent chance of rain in the forecast for Sunday's AFC
Championship Game in Alltell Stadium, it's a potential weather
development that would tend to favor the Tennessee Titans, whose
offense is based on short passes and a power running game.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they've already beaten the Jaguars in a rain game, 20-19
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jaguars, with a healthy running back Fred Taylor
(hamstring pull) and quarterback Mark Brunell's (sprained knee)
mobility returned to near full strength, insist they can play
whatever game unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that if we get out there in the rain, we just
fall apart,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PRACTICE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   If practices are a meaningful indication of performance, the
Jaguars might justify their role as seven-point favorites. ``It was
the best week of practice we had the whole year,'' Brunell said.
``Hopefully, we can take to the playing field what we've seen on
the practice field this week.'' . . . Brunell expects at least some
defensive alterations from the Titans, who had a club-record 54
sacks in the regular season and were plus-5 in turnovers in two
games with the Jaguars. ``There's always a change,'' Brunell said.
``There's always a new blitz. Tennessee does it every time we play
them.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Coughlin, on the difference between this 15-2
Jacksonville team and the team that surprised the league with an
appearance in the 1996 AFC title game, a 20-6 loss at New England:
``In 1996, when we caught fire,'' he said, ``we weren't even a good
idea at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . Jacksonville's injury list is as ideal as a coach could
desire entering a title game. It shows no players listed
questionable and only two probables, running back James Stewart
(ankle) and guard Zach Wiegert (elbow).
</P>
<P>
   Said Coughlin, ``We came out of the Miami game, literally, in
better shape than when we went in.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars free safety Carnell Lake offers a rather candid
description of the no-nonsense Coughlin. ``What you see is pretty
much what you get,'' Lake said. ``He'll have a rare moment where
he'll have a chuckle thrown in, but for the most part it's pretty
much all business.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . Coughlin was asked whether there's a lighter side to him
that the media does not see. Said the coach, ``It depends on how
deep you want to dig.'' . . . Jaguars middle linebacker Lonnie
Marts is less than concerned about proving something to the Titans,
where he was employed for two years before being released in the
preseason. ``I think they know what they missed,'' Marts said.
``That's just part of the business. How can you say they missed?
They're in the same place we are.'' . . . Lake, commenting on the
41-14 loss to the Titans last month and the extra motivation it
provides with the same team standing between them and the Super
Bowl: ``I think anybody on the team who has a competitive bone in
his body was embarrassed.'' . . . The Jaguars, unlike some other
teams in a similar positions, have been patient with the continual
barrage about the two Tennessee losses. ``I think it's only fair
that the focus has been the two losses,'' Lake said. . . . Brunell
calls his left knee ``much stronger than it was last week,'' when
he left in the second quarter against Miami with a 38-0 lead.
``It's even much better (now) than it was on Wednesday,'' he said.
``I have no concern about the knee.'' . . . Of indications that in
the past there was ``tension'' between Coughlin and the
quarterback, Brunell said, ``It was a long time ago. There is no
tension. It's a good working relationship.''

 &HT;    St. Louis awash in blue, gold
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As they did with Mark McGwire, the local populace
has fallen in love anew with the long ball. Any day now, City Hall
will surely announce that the towering Arch down on the Mississippi
riverfront actually symbolizes the parabola of a Kurt
Warner-to-Isaac Bruce touchdown bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this bastion of baseball has gone bananas over football.
The city held a massive downtown pep rally at the old Union Station
on Friday, just like the week before. That one heralded the first
home playoff game in St. Louis football history. This one served as
a warm-up for Sunday's NFC Championship Game against Tampa Bay in
the Trans World Dome. But then, the only thing that needs warming
up around here is the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so excited,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil said. ``I
think (a rally) is a great way to bring a city together. It's a
great way for some people to erase the events or problems of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city of St. Louis deserves this. They spent a lot
of money for the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has strongly supported the Rams since they moved here
from California in 1995 and helped fill the void created when the
football Cardinals fled for Arizona in 1988. They've sold out the
Trans World Dome ever since. But now, the Rams have something
they've lacked since 1989: a winning season, the most unexpectedly
spectacular one in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has reacted in kind. ``GO RAMS'' banners are
everywhere downtown, along with signs declaring the Rams' mantra:
``Gotta Go to Work,'' also the title of a song played every three
hours on one local radio station. Another station regularly plays
another original entitled, ``Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side of One Bell Center, a downtown high-rise, office
lights and shades have been arranged to spell out ``GO RAMS'' at
night. The arches around the rim of Busch Stadium, baseball home of
the Cardinals, are bathed in blue and gold lights. Just as they had
a mock ``Viking Funeral'' last week and burned a Viking ship (OK, a
canoe) before beating Minnesota, fans at Laclede's Landing on the
riverfront Friday night prevented a riverboat _ decorated as a
buccaneers' ship _ from landing.
</P>
<P>
   As it did Sunday for the Minnesota game, one car wash plans to
give away free washes to blue and gold cars. Dozens of fans have
gotten flat-top haircuts like Warner. Only John Shiguely, though,
had his head shaved into brown Rams horns; they complement the full
Rams uniform _ complete with shoulder pads _ he wears to all games.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the pre-game Sunday breakfast of choice
throughout St. Louis will be a nice bowl of Warner's Crunch Time,
the frosted flakes named in the quarterback's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams followed their regular practice schedule Friday.
``Nothing spectacular to report,'' Vermeil said. ``I think we're in
a good frame of mind. I think we can play real good football.'' ...
Kicker Jeff Wilkins didn't kick Friday, a day after he tested the
tendinitis in his left (nonkicking) knee and pronounced himself
ready for Sunday. But his rest Friday was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins and free safety Keith Lyle are listed as probable and
will play Sunday. Lyle, who missed the past eight games with neck
and left shoulder pain because of a nerve problem, won't start but
will play in nickel and dime situations. ...
</P>
<P>
   Overconfidence? The Rams aren't assuming anything despite being
a 14-point favorite. Some defensive players started a kitty Friday
to discourage any Super Bowl talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything other than Tampa Bay, you're going to be fined,''
linebacker Mike Jones said. ``It's 50 bucks. A couple of people
almost got in trouble, but they caught themselves.''

 &HT;    Jags' Super ditty lost on McNair
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Don't play the Jaguars' Super Bowl song for
Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to hear it,'' McNair said. ``You know, that's just
the sound of confidence that they have that they're going to make
it to the Super Bowl. Some people look at it like it's a slap in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players thrive on the in-your-face challenge presented by
the Jacksonville song, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them more aware of what's going through the
Jacksonville team's mind, whether they think they've got it easy or
whether they think they're already in the Super Bowl,'' McNair
said. ``That makes the opponent go out there and play even harder
to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   HOMETOWN BOY
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans make the Super Bowl, center Craig Page will be
back at his alma mater for practice. Georgia Tech is providing the
workout facility for the AFC representative.
</P>
<P>
   Page, whose parents live in Atlanta, moved from the practice
squad to the 53-man roster earlier this month. He said as a
first-year player, he has to remind himself not to take his team's
championship run for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a buddy, (the Falcons') Keith Brooking, went to school
with him, and last year he goes to the Super Bowl his first year,''
Page said. ``Look where he is now. They went nowhere. You never
know. You may never get a chance to do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   GET OUT OF TOWN
</P>
<P>
   The Titans practiced early Friday, finishing at 1:30 p.m. They
went home to pack, then left the Baptist Sports Center complex at
5:15 p.m. for their flight to Jacksonville. They expected to arrive
at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Pittsburgh game Jan. 2, the Titans have usually
departed for road games the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going home and going to bed, we'll be on a plane,''
wide receiver Yancey Thigpen said. ``Then you go to the hotel and
go to bed. It's not a big deal for us going to Jacksonville the day
before (they usually go).''
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO THE BOWL?
</P>
<P>
   Neil O'Donnell is one of three Titans players who have been to
the Super Bowl. He quarterbacked Pittsburgh in 1995 against Dallas
in Super Bowl XXX, where Thigpen was one of his receivers.
Defensive lineman Mike Jones played with the Patriots in Super Bowl
XXXI.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell signed a one-year contract as an unrestricted free
agent last July after he was waived by the Bengals. He led the
Titans to a 4-1 record while McNair recuperated from a back injury,
including the 20-19 win over the Jaguars in September. He threw a
12-yard touchdown pass to Michael Roan with 3:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you a lot of different looks,'' he said of the
Jaguars. ``I know Dom Capers from the days at Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Since McNair returned, O'Donnell has played sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to complain,'' he said. ``When I came here, I knew
my role. It was unfortunate Steve got hurt in training camp. I took
almost every snap in training camp. And then, I started five games
here. But you know, I'm here to win. I don't care who's pulling the
trigger. Let's keep this thing going because we all worked very
hard to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made it clear to the Titans staff that he'd like to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my decision,'' he said. ``We haven't even talked
about that. It's a nice place here, but we'll have to wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   OOPS
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Jon Runyan got a game ball for the playoff victory
over Buffalo but had to give it back. His name was misspelled
``Runyon,'' on the newly painted ball. Runyan said he also gets a
lot of material with his first name spelled ``John.''

JETS SET TO NAME GROH, PARCELLS' CHOICE, AS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets moved forward on two coaching fronts Friday:
the one who is coming and the one who quit.
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh, the linebackers coach, is expected to be named the new
head coach on Monday, succeeding Bill Belichick, who lasted one day
as Bill Parcells' successor.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Jets' organization said that the
55-year-old Groh had been endorsed by the new owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who never wavered from his desire to retire from the
sidelines at age 58, will remain as head of the club's football
operations. It is believed that Johnson offered Parcells $4 million
to return next season.
</P>
<P>
   Groh's only previous head-coaching experience came at Wake
Forest from 1981-1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets said they would have an announcement on their coaching
situation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Groh's elevation came after National Football League
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled Friday that Belichick had
breached his contract for the year 2000 and could not coach another
club without the consent of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's decision could be a prelude to another Jets-Patriots
compensation battle. The decision was not a complete victory for
the Jets, who contended Belichick was bound to them for the three
years remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue asked both sides to reply by Feb. 1 to justify their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman said Friday that the club would not comment
on Tagliabue's ruling. The Patriots have interviewed four potential
head coaches, but none of them was offered the dual role of general
manager, as Belichick was. Thus, it seems certain that the Patriots
will formally ask for Belichick, who will come with a price to be
paid to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Groh has had a successful career with Parcells. He was the
linebackers coach for the New York Giants during the 1989-90
seasons, which included a Super Bowl victory. He was the Giants'
defensive coordinator in 1991 under Ray Handley. In 1992 he joined
Belichick at Cleveland, where Belichick was the head coach, and
then he was reunited with Parcells in what turned out to be a
four-year run as linebackers' coach and coordinator at New England.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells took over the Jets in 1997, Groh came with him. He
helped mold the linebackers into the club's most respected unit.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was coach for a day, last Jan. 3 after Parcells
resigned suddenly. Parcells vowed to straighten out the mess,
saying that ``it happened on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He believed that elevating Groh would give the coaching staff
and players stability. It is likely to mean that Romeo Crennel will
be elevated to defensive coordinator (the Browns were planning to
interview him for that role). It also could mean that Dan Henning,
the quarterbacks' coach who helped restore Vinny Testaverde's
career in 1998, and give Ray Lucas one in 1999, will stay. Parcells
had been planning for almost a year to retire as soon as the season
ended, and he did. By contract, Belichick took over.
</P>
<P>
   The day Belichick was formally named to succeed Parcells, the
Patriots faxed the Jets and asked to interview Belichick as their
coach and general manager. The Jets replied that they had a
contract with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Patriots have not made another formal request to
speak to Belichick, Tagliabue reportedly spoke to at least one
Patriots official. Then, in a separate phone call, he spoke to a
Jets official, presumably Johnson or the team's president, Steve
Gutman.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue was said to be frustrated that he could not get the
sides together to agree to a deal. In almost every case where a
coach has been found to be under contract to his existing team,
another team that wants him parts with draft choices. But that
scenario is complicated with these two clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, the Jets parted with four draft picks _
including a first-rounder _ over a three-year period to get
Parcells, who had a year left on his contract with New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the commissioner's decision is unlawful, and we are
actively assessing all of our legal options,'' said one of
Belichick's attorneys, Neil Cornrich of Cleveland, upon learning of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Another Belichick lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, added, ``I think it
was a legal travesty. I don't think you could put Coach Belichick
in a position to prevent him from pursuing his livelihood for next
year. We're very disappointed. The commissioner doesn't have the
power to do it. We're going to consider everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would not comment on the decision, other than this by
Parcells: ``The commissioner's ruling and order are clear and
self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick had remained, the Jets would have been led by one
of the most respected defensive minds in pro football history. His
greatest success has been with Parcells as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   In five years as head coach of the Cleveland Browns, he made
them competitive again and produced one winning season and a
playoff appearance. But he also served as coach in the Browns' last
season in Cleveland as the team collapsed when word got out that it
would be moving to Baltimore.

FIRST LADY PORTRAYS HERSELF AS STRONGER THAN GIULIANI ON ABORTION

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Signaling that she will not yield the issue of
abortion rights in her race for U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton
Friday presented herself as a stronger advocate on the issue than
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, saying she would make protecting abortion
rights a central concern if she is elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in a speech to an abortion rights group and during
a news conference, asserted that the 1973 Supreme Court decision
providing women the right to abortion was in jeopardy. And she
sought to draw a distinction on the issue between herself and
Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent, notwithstanding the fact
that the two hold essentially identical views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon what happens in the presidential election, what
happens on the Supreme Court and in the federal judiciary, we could
be facing some very serious challenges in the next couple of years
to Roe vs. Wade,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I want New Yorkers to know
that I wouldn't only vote right, but I would be a strong voice, and
I would attempt to organize as much as I could to be sure that we
defended a woman's right to chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want New Yorkers to know that I am and always have been
pro-choice, and that it is not a right that any of us should take
for granted,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``There are a number of forces at
work in our society that would try to turn back the clock and
undermine a woman's right to chose, and we must remain vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, Mrs. Clinton's remarks, in the course of
introducing state Comptroller Carl McCall at a lunch at the Harvard
Club in Manhattan marking the 27th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade,
were meant to demonstrate that she did not intend to concede what
has historically been a potent issue for Democrats running for
statewide office in New York, notwithstanding Giuliani's views on
the issue. One of the keys to the election of Sen. Charles Schumer
in 1998 was his success in drawing attention to Alfonse D'Amato's
opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's support for abortion rights, and his warm relations
with abortion rights groups, thus looms as one of the major
complications Mrs. Clinton faces in constructing a campaign against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which sponsored the lunch, were as praiseworthy of Giuliani
as they were of Mrs. Clinton. Although the mayor did not appear
Friday, he has in the past, and the group's endorsement _ normally
a sure thing for a Democrat _ is very much in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an indication of just how muddled the abortion issue
is in this year's race for Senate, the leader of the Right to Life
Party in New York, Ken Diem, said his party would make a point of
nominating anybody but Giuliani this year.
</P>
<P>
   Diem said that in fact, he would prefer that Mrs. Clinton win
the election as a way of demonstrating to Republicans the risk of
running a candidate who holds views that have generally been viewed
as Democratic positions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't concern me at all,'' Diem said. ``Quite frankly,
I'd rather have the enemy outside of my tent than the enemy who
claims to be my friend, who is Rudy Giuliani. The way the Senate
race is shaping up right now, you have a choice between Frick and
Frack.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Randall Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, one of the
nation's leading anti-abortion groups, said Friday that he might
run as the Right to Life Party candidate, specifically with the
hope of defeating Giuliani and teaching Republicans a lesson.
``He's an enemy inside the camp,'' Terry said. ``An enemy inside
the camp can assassinate you in the night. He's a defector.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton came at the subject from a different position,
arguing that there was a difference between the two prospective
candidates because Giuliani, before he entered office, had opposed
abortion rights. ``I have always been pro-choice, and my position
has never changed and never wavered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York
affiliate of the reproductive rights league, said her organization
was unlikely to take that into account in determining which
candidate to support. Ms. Conlin, who had warm words for both Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani, argued that it would be a mistake to penalize
candidates for office, particularly Republicans, who had changed
their position to support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is not significant, because if you look at people's
records, there are a whole lot of people who have changed their
positions,'' Ms. Conlin said. ``To use that against a person I
think is wrong. I was raised in a very Catholic family and wasn't
always pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the abortion issue appear particularly
complicated this year. The Conservative Party has also said it
might break from political history and not support the Republican
candidate for Senate, because of Giuliani's views on abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, the party chairman, said that while he had not
ruled out supporting Giuliani _ he continues to wait, he said, from
a call for the mayor to discuss a potential alliance _ he was
actively interviewing other potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's support for abortion rights has, in the view of Mrs.
Clinton's supporters, put him in a strong position to compete for
women voters, as well as some Democrats and independents, all
important to Mrs. Clinton's prospects. Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton
took on the issue with some vigor Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current membership of the United States Senate is not
something that we can count on to protect a woman's right to
choose,'' she said. ``For women, the Senate will be our court of
last resort, both because of the votes that will be taken there on
issues, and because of the votes that are likely to be taken on
judicial nominees. It will not be enough for any senator simply to
cast the right vote and sit down.''

 UNDATED: Steele said.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Durk I. Jager, Procter &AMP; Gamble's chairman, has vowed to shake
things up at Procter &AMP; Gamble. At the company's annual meeting in
October, for instance, Jager closed the meeting with these words to
shareholders: ``A few years from now P&AMP;G will be a very different
kind of company than it is today, still based on our core values
and principles, but totally different in almost every other
respect. We will be faster, more experimental, more open, more
collaborative _ inside and out, more unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Wednesday, when The Wall Street Journal first
reported that discussions had begun, analysts have been relatively
skeptical that such a deal would happen. And it is possible that if
the talks continue, Procter &AMP; Gamble could decide it wants only one
of the two companies, possibly American Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see many synergies. Marketing is not enough,'' said
Sergio Traversa, at Mehta Partners, an investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But shares in Procter &AMP; Gamble are down more than 12 percent for
the week, suggesting that traders believe that the company is
serious about making an offer for either one or both of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the discussions may put more pressure on Pfizer to
come up with a higher bid than the $78 billion offered to
Warner-Lambert shareholders last November. People close to the
talks said Pfizer executives were approached by Warner-Lambert
representatives about raising their bid. And one person close to
Pfizer said the company would be willing to raise its bid if it
made sense to do so, a posture the company has taken all along.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure: If the companies are combined, consumers may
find themselves overwhelmed with television ads for Warner-Lambert
and American Home's prescription drugs. Procter &AMP; Gamble is adept
at selling products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies are now making advertising to consumers
a key to their business strategies. Last year, the drug companies
spent almost $1.9 billion on consumer advertising, according to
Scott-Levin, an industry consulting firm, up from $720 million in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Drug analysts said they did not think Procter &AMP; Gamble would be
willing to make such a big acquisition because of how it would
lower future earnings. If indeed Procter &AMP; Gamble is successful,
analysts said there would be little antitrust concern because, with
the exception of a few consumer products, there is little overlap
in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Neil B. Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.,
said he did not believe that P&AMP;G would want to get into a bidding
war for Warner-Lambert with Pfizer. And, if it bought American
Home, it would also inherit that company's potential liabilities of
billions of dollars from lawsuits filed by people who said they
were harmed by the drug combination fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, drug analysts are still betting that Pfizer would
win the escalating battle for Warner-Lambert. ``Bill Steele wants
Warner-Lambert,'' Traversa, the analyst at Mehta Partners, said of
Pfizer's chairman. ``And, Pfizer has the muscle.''

   GORE'S DISBANDED FAN CLUB
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican
presidential contender, to an audience Friday in Greenville, S.C.,
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was a manager of President
Clinton's impeachment trial, said he and the Arizona senator ``both
have voted to make Al Gore president _ last year, but we're not
going to do it again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NOW, PINCH-HITTING: MOM
</P>
<P>
   With most presidential candidates in Iowa for the homestretch
before the caucuses, friends and relatives were on the stump Friday
in New Hampshire. George W. Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, stopped in
five towns, and all four of the Texas governor's siblings are due
in New Hampshire this weekend. Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut
campaigned for Vice President Al Gore. And Bill Russell and other
former basketball stars spoke for Bill Bradley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUNAWAY RACE IN CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows Bush with a comfortable lead of 51 percent to
29 percent over McCain among Republicans in South Carolina, which
holds a primary on Feb. 19. The Clemson University poll, which
surveyed 650 Republican primary voters, found that Bush was
considered kinder and more religious than McCain, in a state with
many Christian conservatives. According to the poll, about a third
of those who have not voted Republican in the past plan to vote in
the Republican primary, which is open to all voters. Independents
planning to vote also support Bush, but by a 44-to-32 ratio.
Military veterans favor McCain, a Vietnam War hero, but only 10
percent of those surveyed said they were voting, and a quarter of
those were Democrats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NECK-AND-NECK IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows that one of the tightest Senate races could be
the one in Michigan between Sen. Spencer Abraham, a Republican, and
Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat. A survey of 600 registered voters
conducted from Jan. 7 to 14 for The Detroit News found 40 percent
supported Ms. Stabenow and 39 percent supported Abraham. There was
a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRY, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore stumped across farm country
in central Iowa Friday, recalling his days in the 4-H Club, his
Angus cattle and how his father taught him to stop gullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my dad the respect for the environment that all
farmers who farm their own land have,'' Gore told a barnful of
farmers and their families here, noting that he grew up in a
Washington hotel but spent his summers on the family farm in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a young boy, he used to teach me how to stop a
gully before it really got started,'' Gore said. ``At first I
couldn't see the lay of the land the way he could and recognize
when a gully was starting up there, but I learned from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination,
noted that farming accounted for only 20 percent of Iowa's economy.
But, he said, ``the space between the concentrated population in
the cities depends upon the health of the farm economy.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his pitch for votes in Monday's Iowa caucuses, he
said he wanted to bring income to rural areas from sources other
than farming, like the Internet. He said that Iowa's Democratic
governor, Tom Vilsack, who has remained neutral in the contest, had
helped the state develop ``the most sophisticated information
superhighway of any state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bus tour across Iowa was punctuated with brief references
to his opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who said
on Thursday that he had experienced four bouts of irregular
heartbeat in the last month. Gore told reporters: ``He's in great
health, and it shouldn't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the expectations for his performance in Monday's caucuses, in
which polls show him ahead, Gore said: ``After Senator Bradley has
spent so much more money _ more money than any other Democratic
candidate in history here _ and has invested as much time and
people and TV ads and whatnot as he has, I think that if I can get
one more vote than he does, that is a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has appeared extremely confident and relaxed in the last
few days. He gave interviews on three drive-time radio programs
Friday morning, joshing with the local hosts and lapsing into a
heavy Southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   As a hedge against complacency, Gore insisted that he was still
fighting for every vote. ``I feel like a guy working with every
ounce of breath I have to get one more vote than the other guy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is also broadcasting four new commercials.
They emphasize his commitment to ``fight for the average working
person,'' as well as testimonials from Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer in New York.

OLD COMPANIES, NEW STOCKS: BUT WILL OUTSIDE INVESTORS BITE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Conn.)   (Eds: See related story MUTUAL-INSURERS)  
 (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two big mutual life insurance companies _ John Hancock and
Metropolitan Life _ are preparing to distribute millions of shares
of stock to their policyholders and sell millions more to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Neither stock is expected to roar out of the starting gates.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that shares in both companies should provide
investors with gradual gains as well as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not recommending John Hancock and we probably won't
recommend Met Life because we want our investors to see a very good
growth rate of 40 to 50 percent a year, and the insurance stocks
don't offer that,'' said Gerald R. Eddy, a senior editor at the
Institute for Econometric Research, a company in Deerfield Beach,
Fla., that tracks initial public offerings. ``But over the long
haul people will probably do fine with these stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., which is to become
John Hancock Financial Services Inc., has scheduled its offering
for Thursday as it reorganizes as a shareholder-owned company. The
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.'s initial public offering is
expected in late March. Another big mutual, the Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, and several Canadian mutuals are also
planning to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will be unleashing a flood of shares on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, for example, plans to issue 331.7 million shares,
including 229.7 million to its policyholders, the formal owners of
the company, in compensation for their contributions through
premium payments.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life expects to issue more than 812 million shares,
including about 576 million to its policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies that have gone public in the last few years have
issued 5 million to 10 million shares, though most were start-ups.
Both big insurers have been doing business for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Most policyholders will be allowed to take their compensation in
cash or stock. Depending on other investment considerations,
policyholders may find the stock more attractive because unlike the
cash, the stock is not taxable until it is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Outside investors are not expected to stampede for these stocks.
Both companies have relatively low returns on equity and are likely
to be priced at close to book value, while many competitors are
already trading at 1.5 times their book value and better.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, shares in the entire field of financial services,
including banks and brokerage firms, are depressed because of
lackluster performance and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   All this means that companies with great brand names will be
available relatively cheaply, but that noticeable early gains are
not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutional investors are required to allocate some of
their money to dividend-producing shares, so they are sure to be
among the buyers of the converted life insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people who look at Internet stocks are not going to be
real interested in these companies,'' said Randall Roth, a senior
analyst at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Conn., which provides
research for institutional investors and runs the IPO Plus
Aftermarket fund.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, John Hancock expects to raise about $1.8 billion. And
Met Life is anticipating about $5.6 billion, which would make its
initial offering the country's richest ever, surpassing the
previous record-holder, United Parcel Service, which raised $5.47
billion in November.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life also expects to instantly become the company with the
largest number of shareholders, perhaps 10 million, compared with
the current leader, Lucent Technologies, which has about 4.6
million.

A PRIVILEGED, RUMOR-TRAILED LIFE NOW FACES THE GLARE OF A TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a family man and nonstop talker who does impeccable
foreign accents and a wicked impression of Curly of the Three
Stooges. A formidable athlete and professional speed-skier who
narrowly missed making the U.S. Olympic team. A recovering
alcoholic and deeply religious man who recites the rosary every day
and regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   This, according to his relatives and friends, is the real
Michael C. Skakel, a flawed but amiable figure out of F. Scott
Fitzgerald with one foot in the world of the Kennedys and another
in the world of blue blood Republicans in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But to investigators and many Greenwich residents, the real
Skakel is someone totally different: an arrogant and unrepentant
killer who did something horrible as a teen-ager, nearly 25 years
ago, and has lived ever since as a wealthy layabout, commuting
between the golf courses and the ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Greenwich police charged Skakel, 39, with murder
in the 1975 slaying of Martha Moxley, a 15-year-old girl who lived
across the street from the Skakels in the exclusive Belle Haven
neighborhood. Already, the case promises to be one of the
most-scrutinized celebrity trials in years, complete with legal
pyrotechnics over whether Skakel should be charged as a juvenile
and what kind of evidence might be presented, all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   What the arrest has also done, though, is thrust into the
spotlight, once again, a man who has spent much of his life trying
to escape the rumors and accusations dogging him, his older brother
Thomas, and by extension, his entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, who has always insisted on his innocence, has
declined to speak in public. But interviews in recent days with
friends, relatives and neighbors, reveal a cracked-mirror portrait
of a man who comes across as affable, guileless and charming to
some and pampered, arrogant and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel has long been portrayed as a dark figure, even a presumed
killer. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Skakel's cousin, was one of
several people who rallied to Skakel's defense. Saying that too
many people had presumed that Skakel was already guilty, Kennedy
criticized the authors Dominick Dunne and Mark Fuhrman for
identifying Skakel as the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is as honest as daylight,'' said Kennedy, who spoke
yesterday by phone from Iowa, where he was campaigning for Vice
President Al Gore. ``Michael is a victim largely of Dominick
Dunne's vendetta and Mark Fuhrman's greed, and there's nobody who
deserves this less, principally because he's innocent, but also
because he's a genuinely good and decent soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The Skakels began their climb to prominence in the early 1900s,
after George Skakel, Skakel's grandfather, helped establish Great
Lakes Coal &AMP; Coke Co., a manufacturer in the Midwest. The family
eventually moved east, settling in Greenwich in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, one of George Skakel's daughters, Ethel Skakel, married
Robert F. Kennedy, in what was billed as a marriage between two
powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families. Like the Kennedys,
the Skakels loved the outdoors and excelled in sports. But unlike
the Kennedys, the Skakels were conservative Republicans,
uninterested in politics or public service.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Skakels may have been best known, in the
rarefied orbits of Greenwich, for wild partying and boorish
behavior, according to books by Timothy Dumas, a Greenwich native,
and Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective accused of
racism during the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton Skakel, Ethel's older brother, and his wife, Ann, had
seven children _ six boys and a girl. Michael, the fifth, was
regarded as the most gregarious and charismatic, Dumas said, but
one who was also prone to angry fits and cruel acts against
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Skakel, an alcoholic, was often absent, traveling the
world for the family business. So after the death of Michael's
mother in 1973, the children were basically reared by hired help in
a setting often without structure and saturated by alcohol,
according to Dumas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a place that nobody wanted their kids to play,''
Fuhrman said by phone Friday. .
</P>
<P>
   Then came the night of Oct. 30, 1975. According to police
reports and various accounts, Ms. Moxley visited the Skakel home
with several friends after an evening of pre-Halloween pranks. She
left the residence, but never made it home. The next day, her
bludgeoned body was found under trees on her family's property.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later determined that she had been beaten with a
golf club that belonged to the Skakels, and stabbed with a piece of
the club's shattered shaft. But investigators could not pin the
murder on any of the prime suspects _ not Michael, then 15, not
Thomas, then 17, not Kenneth Littleton, a tutor who was living with
the Skakels at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade or so, Michael Skakel, who was also
dyslexic, shuttled in and out of rehabilitation programs. Between
1978 and 1980, he attended the Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine,
a private institution which, at the time, catered to children with
mental health and substance abuse problems, said Joe Ricci, the
school's owner.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposedly during a group therapy session at the school
that Skakel blurted out that he had killed Ms. Moxley, according to
numerous accounts. But Ricci denied that such a confession had
occurred. Skakel ``had a slight build and never showed signs of any
kind of violence,'' Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a family friend, though, Skakel was traumatized by
his experiences at Elan, and tried to escape several times. His
classmates even made Skakel wear a toilet seat on his head that
said, ``I am a murderer,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, Skakel managed to kick his alcoholism,
friends and relatives said, and graduated from Curry College in
Milton, Mass., in the mid-1990s after completing a program for
people with learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings daily, even
several times a day. He began to help friends and relatives with
their addictions as well, functioning as a de facto counselor. And
he became even more religious, taking the rosary everywhere he
went, and praying daily, according to a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he found a new calling: speed-skiing, in which
people race down steep slopes, usually in France, at more than 120
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Skakel _ agile and strong at 6 feet tall and 210 pounds
_ was named to the national speed-skiing team, and narrowly missed
making the Olympic team, which participated in a demonstration
sport at the Winter Games in Albertville, France. And Skakel _
known as Skakes to his professional-skier friends _ developed bonds
with a small but tight circuit of speed-skiers, said Jim Morgan, a
professional skier who was in the Lake Tahoe area this week doing
commentary for NBC's ``Gravity Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller, a close friend and co-owner of Hamilton Sports, in
Aspen, Colo., who last saw Skakel in August, said: ``Michael's got
a heart of gold. He's the kind of guy who would always have you go
first'' on the slopes, ``or buy you coffee or totally insist on
buying you lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, during a competition in France, Skakel
achieved his personal best: 137 miles per hour _ or 220 kilometers
per hour, breaking the sport's equivalent of the four-minute mile.
But he left the competition early to tend to what family friends,
Dumas and Fuhrman believe may have been the first and only real job
of his life: working for his cousin Michael L. Kennedy in Boston at
the nonprofit Citizens Energy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In company records, Skakel was listed as director of
international programs, monitoring the company's programs
throughout Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. In reality,
Skakel worked chiefly as Kennedy's driver and assistant, family
friends said, accompanying him on trips to Africa and to Cuba,
where they met Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel and his wife, Margot, a golf pro, settled in Cohasset,
Mass., where neighbors described him as generous, friendly and
always willing to help. ``I was in the hospital with a stroke for
three months while he was living next door,'' said Thomas Healy, a
retired telephone-installation foreman. ``He would stop in to see
my wife every day and ask her if she needed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the relationship with his cousin soured after
Skakel reportedly cooperated with prosecutors investigating
allegations that Kennedy had had an affair with his children's
teen-age baby sitter. Skakel was also prepared to write a memoir,
tentatively titled ``Dead Man Talking,'' in which he would touch on
the alleged affair. So far it has found no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel eventually quit Citizens Energy Corp. and moved to Hobe
Sound, Fla., about half an hour north of Palm Beach, where he lives
with his wife, their infant son and his father.
</P>
<P>
   They live in an exclusive guarded neighborhood surrounded by
various mobile and RV parks, vegetable and fruit stands and small
motels. And while many residents said they did not know the
Skakels, others said that Michael Skakel had rubbed them the wrong
way, as a spoiled man living off his father's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, Skakel has been unable to continue his
skiing exploits _ burdened, friends say, by the continued
complications of the Moxley killing. And so when he appeared on
television Wednesday walking into the Greenwich police station,
friends said that they were shocked at his appearance, and the 30
or so pounds he had put on.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he was not so garrulous, silently walking past a
gaggle of reporters and curiosity-seekers with only a wan smile on
his face.

<P>
   Vernon Forrest will step into a ring in Las Vegas on Saturday
night for the 31st time as a professional boxer. It will not be a
title fight. Although he is undefeated in eight years as a pro and
is considered one of the best welterweights in the world, Forrest
has never been given a chance to fight a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Johnson, a Brooklyn-born boxer, never got a title fight,
either. Johnson died of injuries he suffered during a bout in
Atlantic City, N.J., two months ago. Canadian authorities had
suspended him for medical reasons last April, but officials in New
Jersey, South Carolina and Georgia continued to let him fight,
despite a CAT scan suggesting that he might have a brain injury and
required more medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the tales of these two fighters underscore what many
critics say is the pivotal problem in boxing today: there is no
central governing body, as there is in other professional sports,
that would enforce safety rules, create credible rankings and
insure that the best fighters rise. In short, no one is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   And while government generally has not regulated boxing
aggressively, a federal judge in Newark, N.J., did step in last
week, appointing a monitor to run the International Boxing
Federation, the only U.S.-based group that ranks professional
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time that a federal court had intervened to
oversee a private sports organization, and it followed the
indictment last November of four IBF officials on charges of
soliciting bribes from managers and promoters to inflate boxers'
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport is a bit like Dodge City,'' said Lou DiBella, a
senior vice president at Home Box Office, a major broadcaster of
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations vary from state to state, as does enforcement.
Contracts among fighters, managers, promoters and television
outlets are unregulated and often written to exploit young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctioning organizations do not rank each other's champions,
leading to a proliferation of titles, but few fights between the
best fighters. There are now 47 champions in 17 weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most damaging to the sport's standing is that the
ranking of contenders has often lacked credibility and that the
federal and state governments have failed _ at least until last
week _ to take charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governance of the sport is corrupt, period,'' DiBella
said, ``and everyone involved in the sport knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been able to do much about it. Boxing has long
defied efforts to clean it up. That is partly because no one is
truly in charge and partly because change would not be in the
interest of the small circle of promoters, rating organizations and
celebrity boxers who benefit from the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing promoters, unlike employers in other sports, see
themselves as individual entrepreneurs in competition with one
another, rather than as a group with a mutual interest in
protecting the sport's image and promoting fair and credible
competition, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corruption in the industry has never been so
complicated,'' said Elliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general, who headed a task force on boxing. ``It's just been
impossible to root out.''

   Vernon Forrest fell in love with pugilism early, at the age of
6, when he wandered from a playground into a nearby gym in Augusta,
Ga. A well-respected light-heavyweight, Binny Heard, was knocking
sparring partners to the canvas. Forrest was entranced.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an auto mechanic and a cleaning woman, Forrest fought
225 amateur fights and lost only 16. In 1991, he won a silver medal
at the world amateur championships, losing on points to Konstantin
Tszyu, one of the world's best welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he won the U.S. amateur title and was
favored to do well in the Olympics. But he contracted a stomach
virus the night before his first bout and lost. His teammate, Oscar
De La Hoya, won a gold medal that year and has since become a
welterweight superstar.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional, Forrest, who is 28, has won all 30 of his
bouts, 25 by knockout. Steve Farhood, the former editor of Ring
magazine, said Forrest was talented enough to deserve a title
fight, even though he has not fought many highly ranked fighters.
Most champions and contenders do not want to fight a dangerous
fighter with little name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a guy the very best don't want to fight,''
Farhood said. ``It's all about risk versus reward. With Vernon the
risk is very high, and the reward is not where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Forrest had risen to No. 4 in the World Boxing
Council ranking, where De La Hoya had become champion. But Forrest
could not get a title shot from the champion's promoter, Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said that, because Forrest was not well known, he would not
draw enough viewers to pay-per-view television to make a fight
profitable. ``It has nothing to do with ability, but nobody knows
who Vernon Forrest is,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest's handlers decided he might have a better shot competing
in the International Boxing Federation, where Felix Trinidad has
been the champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Forrest was also unable to rise to the coveted No. 1
contender's status in the IBF ranking. What irks Forrest and his
handlers was that a series of fighters with questionable skills
remained above him in the ranking, and two of them, Vincent Pettway
and Raul Frank, were promoted by Don King, who is also Trinidad's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway tied up the top contender's spot for more than two
years, though most boxing aficionados considered his ranking
absurd. He had not fought anyone with a winning record since 1995
and had not fought a welterweight with a winning record since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway was abruptly dropped from the ranking on the eve of a
mandatory fight with the champion, Trinidad, last April after HBO
executives, fearing a bloodbath, objected to televising the fight.
A doctor discovered just before the bout that Pettway had a
detached retina.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettway disappeared from view, Hugo Pineda, of Colombia,
became the top contender. Pineda, who had fought primarily against
little-known boxers in Colombia, was ranked right above Forrest at
No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That ranking apparently was tainted, however. In November 1997,
Pineda jumped from No. 6 to No. , after a $5,000 bribe was paid to
IBF officials, according to the federal indictment. Although the
indictment did not name Pineda, it gave details identifying the
date and terms of his ascension in the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda fought Trinidad in Puerto Rico last May, with Trinidad
knocking him out in the fourth round. With Pettway and Pineda gone,
Forrest rose to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the final insult for Forrest came last October, when he was
dropped back down to No. 4 by the IBF. Shane Mosley, a powerful
lightweight who had moved up to the welterweight division, was
placed above him, even though Forrest had beaten Mosley in their
only meeting, as amateurs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The other fighter who moved past Forrest in October, Michael
Covington, a little-known journeyman, was promptly knocked out in
November by a fighter ranked below Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   Because Forrest has never reached the coveted top contender's
slot, he had no leverage in negotiations with King, the champion's
promoter. Forrest's manager, Shelly Finkel, said he had approached
King several times about arranging a fight against Trinidad, but
King demanded that Forrest give King rights to future fights in
return for a title bout. ``He wanted too much,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fritz, a spokesman for King, denied that King has any
influence over the IBF's rankings, although he acknowledged that
King was in a position to demand concessions from Forrest. ``If
Vernon Forrest really wants to fight Felix Trinidad, then he needs
to make an agreement that is good for the champion,'' Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, who has never made more than $100,000 for a bout, said
he was now desperate enough to make a deal with King. ``In boxing
you have four or five guys making the majority of the money,''
Forrest said, ``and everyone else is in the lower class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I always thought I would retire around
30,'' he said. ``I thought by then I would have accomplished all my
goals in the professional game. But I haven't even scratched the
surface of what I wanted to accomplish.''

</P>
<P>
   Dubious rankings and outright corruption are hardly new in
boxing. For much of the 20th century, organized crime controlled
the sport in America. But what distinguishes boxing from other
professional sports is that repeated efforts to clean it up have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Those failures are linked to boxing's structure: there is no
organized association of fighters or managers or promoters that
could oversee fundamental change. And government has generally been
unable or unwilling to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who run the organizations that rank fighters
became powerful in the late 1970s and 1980s as self-proclaimed
reformers, intending to reward contenders solely on the merits. But
they, too, have come under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a federal judge last week used for the first time
a civil racketeering statute usually employed against organized
crime and corrupt labor unions to appoint a monitor to run the IBF.
The appointment was sought by federal prosecutors after the
indictment of four IBF officials on bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effects of this prosecution are hard to predict,
of course. But critics, including many boxing people, say the
industry's chaotic structure has made it nearly impossible to
repair. Without a central governing body, there are no universally
recognized rankings, no coherent system of rules, no ethical
guidelines for contracts, no fair business standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the more powerful promoters like the status quo,''
said Arum, who is among the top American boxing promoters, along
with King, Cedric Kushner, Kathy Duva and Dan Goosen.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Sugar, a historian of the sport, described boxing as ``the
last single entrepreneurial sport there is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are out there cannibalizing everyone else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The few professional boxers who achieve celebrity status and
contracts for multimillion-dollar title fights also benefit from
the present system. But the mythology of the fighter who rises from
poverty to wealth belies reality: managers say that fewer boxers
than ever before are even able to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has shied away from a direct role in
overseeing boxing, although Congress passed legislation in 1994
requiring states to share information and honor medical suspensions
of boxers issued by individual states.
</P>
<P>
   States have not been particularly aggressive about regulating
boxing, in part because some _ like New York, New Jersey and Nevada
_ are in competition for bouts.
</P>
<P>
   New York did begin last year to require promoters and ranking
groups to disclose their contracts and fees. But if one state were
to come down hard on boxing unilaterally, promoters would simply
move bouts to other places.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, New York's attorney general, said that unless states
agreed to raise the bar together, efforts to improve boxing would
fail. ``One state against the other will destroy the sport,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the existing regulations do not always protect fighters.
The death of Stephan Johnson is a sad case study.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a junior middleweight, and his manager were able to
gain approval last year for fights in three states while he was
under medical suspension in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario authorities had suspended Johnson after he suffered
an odd knockout during a fight against Fitz Vanderpool in Toronto
last April. Though he had led in scoring through most of the bout,
Johnson appeared simply to stagger back and collapsed in the 10th
round, without being hit. ``He was just like he ran out of gas,''
the Ontario athletics commissioner, Ken Hayaschi, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayaschi required Johnson to undergo a CAT scan, a brain wave
test and four hours of tests involving memory and motor skills
before fighting again. Ontario posted the suspension on the
Internet through Fight Fax, a private records company that is an
official clearinghouse for medical information.
</P>
<P>
   A CAT scan was performed on Johnson in New York City two days
after the fight. Johnson sent a written report on the CAT scan to
Ontario's boxing regulators, but he never submitted the other two
tests. Hayaschi said he simply filed the CAT scan away and waited
for the other tests to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Johnson fell unconscious during a fight in
Atlantic City last November and subsequently died that Hayaschi
pulled the file and showed Johnson's CAT scan to Canadian
neurologists. The doctors said there were slight abnormalities in
Johnson's brain that warranted further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was border-line normal,'' Hayaschi said. ``I would never
have let him fight again based on that CAT scan alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York radiologist who administered the scan, Dr. Mika
Lidov, wrote in her report that a magnetic resonance imaging test
was needed to determine whether a dense area on one side of the
brain was evidence of internal bleeding, which would indicate a
brain injury, said three people who have read the report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Johnson's suspension in Canada, the boxing commission in
South Carolina approved a fight in August between Johnson and
Otilio Villarreal. The state commission ruled that it did not have
to honor the Ontario suspension because it came from a foreign
country, said James Knight, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires a state seeking to lift a boxer's
suspension to consult in writing with the state that imposed the
suspension. The law does not spell out whether a state must consult
with a Canadian province or other foreign jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   A family doctor in South Carolina, Dr. R.L. Ashton, gave each
fighter a physical before the bout and pronounced each of them fit.
The matchmaker, Walter Johnson, said he gave Stephan Johnson's CAT
scan results to the boxing commission at the weigh-in, but it is
unclear whether Ashton reviewed it. Ashton did not return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fought 10 rounds against Villarreal without difficulty
and won the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's manager, Kenneth Woods, arranged another bout in
Albany, Ga., for early October. Georgia does not require a CAT scan
for fighters who have been knocked out. But Thomas Mishou, the
executive director of the Georgia Boxing Commission, told the
matchmaker, Bobby Mitchell, on Sept. 22 that Johnson would have to
convince Canadian authorities that he was healthy before he could
fight in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the matchmaker informed Mishou that the suspension
had been lifted. Mishou then checked with Fight Fax, he said, and
Johnson's name had indeed been removed from the list.
</P>
<P>
   How that happened is a mystery. Phill Marder, the president of
Fight Fax, said that on Sept. 23, South Carolina officials had
contacted his company to say Johnson should be taken off the
suspension list. South Carolina authorities deny they made the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fought Calvin Moody, an overmatched journeyman, on Oct.
2 in Georgia, knocking him out.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Johnson again gained approval to fight, this
time from the New Jersey State Athletic Commission for a November
bout in Atlantic City against Paul Vaden _ a match that could have
led to a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson's death, the state attorney general and the
director of gaming enforcement began an investigation into how he
got approved to fight in New Jersey. While no one at the New Jersey
commission would comment on the case last week, a commission
spokeswoman said in December that Sylvester Cuy-ler, a chief boxing
inspector who is not a doctor, had approved Johnson's application
after he reviewed Johnson's CAT scan, along with some other tests.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Rhonda Utley Herring, said Cuyler looked at the
radiologist's report, interpreted it to mean the fighter's brain
was normal and sent the application to his superiors for approval.
It is not clear whether any doctor in New Jersey reviewed the CAT
scan results before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th round of the Atlantic City bout, Johnson staggered
backward after absorbing a series of light blows and fainted,
hitting his head on the rope and mat. He died 15 days later of
bleeding and swelling on the left side of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   His family is planning a lawsuit against all three state boxing
commissions. ``It was certainly a questionable CAT scan and should
have provoked additional inquiry at the very least,'' said a lawyer
for Johnson's family, Richard Giampa. ``Based on the evidence of
the CAT scan alone, he should not have been permitted to fight.''

   MIAMI _ As news spread that Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers were
in the United States holding a news conference, the question that
ricocheted among the boy's Florida relatives and their supporters
was this: Why did the women go to New York to visit politicians and
not to Miami to visit their 6-year-old grandson?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the grandmothers are really concerned about the
boy, they should come to Miami where the family here has told them
not only are they welcome, but we'll roast a pig for them,'' said
Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives, who are
suing the government to block the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should see where he sleeps, where he plays, where he goes
to school and see the love and affection he gets at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers, moving from tearful to angry as they
talked to reporters Friday, made clear that they would not visit
Miami, which they said was populated by the Cuban exile ``mafia.''
And Elian's Miami relatives, including his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who has temporary custody of the boy, said they had no
plans to take Elian to New York to see the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come, see the boy and be with the boy,'' Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his lawyers reiterated that the courts must decide
whether Elian stays here or is turned over to his grandmothers.
``That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this
country can resolve this problem,'' said Delfin Gonzalez, another
of Elian's great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
   Some Miamians saw the grandmothers' visit as orchestrated by the
Clinton administration and the Cuban government to build support
for the boy's return to Cuba. And Spencer Eig, another family
lawyer, said the grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela
Quintana, clearly showed that they had been manipulated by the
Cuban government, which he said had turned them against their Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lost his mother after the boat on which they were fleeing
Cuba for Miami capsized. His father wants the boy sent back to him
and immigration officials have ordered him returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they know about the situation is what the Cuban government
has told them over the last two months,'' Eig said. ``I'm sure the
Cuban government has filled them with propaganda and vitriol
against the Gonzalez family.''
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than react angrily at the grandmothers' sometimes
harsh words, many in the exile community did the opposite Friday.
In a gesture meant to show Cuba's president, Fidel Castro, that
they were not hostile ``kidnappers,'' many Cuban-Americans urged
the grandmothers to visit Miami, and one community leader offered
to pay for their trip.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a help for the grandmothers to see that Elian is
content and well-adjusted, said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers
to the Rescue, a prominent exile group. ``We are not what people
have painted us to be in Cuba,'' Basulto said. ``I will offer them
my house, my protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives and their lawyers were quick to contradict
the grandmothers' assertions that the boy had told them repeatedly
on the telephone that he wanted to return to Cuba. Delfin Gonzalez,
the great-uncle, said that just Friday Elian had repeated his wish
to stay in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to go,'' Gonzalez said. ``Nobody here has told
him anything or pressured him at all. He himself says he doesn't
want to go.''

CANADA KILLS SUBSIDY PLAN FOR 6 NHL FRANCHISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after agreeing to help subsidize the National Hockey
League teams based in Canada, the Canadian government Friday
abandoned its plan after it was deluged with angry public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers and government officials objected to the prospect of
paying teams up to $2.5 million Canadian (about $1.7 million
American) annually for many reasons, including the low priority of
bailing out private businesses that employ millionaire athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians have made their views known on taxpayers' assistance
to professional hockey,'' said John Manley, the industry minister,
who announced the subsidy program on Tuesday. ``The prime minister
and I want them to know today that his government listens and takes
their views very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of the plan raises the specter of another struggling
team moving to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and the six Canadian clubs are committed to doing
everything in our power to keep them in Canada, to keep them viable
and competitive,'' Gary B. Bettman, the NHL commissioner, said
Friday during a telephone conference call. He added, ``I'm not as
optimistic today as I was on Tuesday. We have to follow-up and
regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL had lobbied for more than 18 months for national
assistance for the Canadian-based teams. The league's two Canadian
cornerstones, Montreal and Toronto, don't need the help.
</P>
<P>
   However Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa and Vancouver are jeopardized
by high taxes and the weak Canadian dollar. Canadian teams take in
most of their revenues in Canadian dollars, but their biggest
expense, player salaries, is paid in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that pays 40 percent of its gross revenues is a
tough nut to swallow,'' Bettman said. ``I'm not sure any business
is viable under those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Bryden put his seven-year-old Ottawa Senators franchise up
for sale last year, citing crushing property taxes. At the time, he
suggested that a move to the United States was his best chance for
survival. On Tuesday, enthused by the subsidy plan announced by
Manley, Bryden took his club off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bryden said the ``For Sale'' sign is ``still in the
garage, but it's probably useful we didn't burn it.'' He said he
will take 10 days to decide his next move. He is seeking $3.9
million in property tax relief from the Ontario government on the
Corel Center which opened in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Short of changing the compensation system in the NHL, which
cannot be done without reopening the collective bargaining
agreement (it expires in 2004), Bettman said the league must focus
on securing local governmental aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern, which became realized in Quebec and
Winnipeg, is when you get to a situation where nobody wants to
operate a team in a particular location,'' he said. ``Then you
don't have much of a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver as the renamed
Colorado Avalanche. A year later, the Winnipeg Jets moved to
Phoenix, and they now play as the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Canadian aid plan, the teams would have been eligible
for an estimated $2 million to $2.5 million Canadian annually in
assistance, which was contingent upon getting equivalent aid from
the NHL, and local and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL aid was in place. For four years, U.S.-based teams have
paid into the Canadian supplemental currency assistance plan, a
fund to help teams struggling with the wide disparity between the
two currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa and Vancouver have met the stiff
eligibility requirements of the plan _ which require that they run
their businesses well yet are still hurt by taxes and currency woes
_ and shared $44 million (Canadian).

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investing chat rooms are great gauges of what is hot
among today's fickle and fidgety stock traders. The chat room craze
du jour is stocks of companies that are currently insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, investors have thronged into shares of troubled
companies like Fruit of the Loom, Levitz Furniture, Loehmann's,
Iridium World Communications and the Singer Co. Between Jan. 10 and
Jan. 12, for example, Levitz Furniture shares went from 5 cents to
37 cents on no news. And last Wednesday, Loehmann's stock almost
tripled for no apparent reason, going from 12 cents a share to 34
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to pay their debts, most of these companies are trying to
restructure their borrowings and get back on track through the
bankruptcy court process known as Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, the chatterers seem to view these companies'
depressed shares as bets worth taking. One Fruit of the Loom fan
posted this message on a Yahoo board last week: ``FTL's earnings
were upgraded by First Call to less of a loss, this makes me
believe that we have nowhere to go but up from here.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to investors who specialize in distressed
companies, the odds of a common stockholder ending up with anything
of value once a reorganization is complete are close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owning the common stock is absolutely ridiculous for economic
reasons,'' said Martin J. Whitman, chief executive of Third Avenue
Trust, a mutual fund concern, and a veteran investor in distressed
companies. ``If I wanted to control the bankruptcy process, I might
want to buy up the common. But what does that have to do with the
chat room people?''
</P>
<P>
   In a typical revamping, stockholders wind up with nothing. Only
the creditors _ the banks, bondholders, preferred stockholders and
so on _ get anything back.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet chat reveals that some of the investors buying into
these companies know little about the reorganization process. A
message posted on Yahoo's Fruit of the Loom board said: ``A company
has value until they tell the public there's no value.'' Another
stated flatly that a bankruptcy judge could wipe out a company's
debt and leave the equity alone, a ruling that would be as likely
as a snowball surviving Dante's Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Fruit of the Loom, the eighth-largest company to file
for bankruptcy last year, were among the most active on the New
York Stock Exchange last Thursday. The stock closed Friday at
$2.375, up more than 150 percent since Dec. 30, when the company
filed for Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, said Gordon McCormick, managing director at M.J.
Whitman Inc. He points out that the prices at which a distressed
company's bonds trade reveals what chances a stockholder has of
recovering anything in a reorganization. ``If bonds are in the
mid-50s, maybe stockholders get a tip to go along, like 25 cents,''
he said. ``When there are bonds under 10, the stock gets zero.''
Fruit of the Loom's most junior bonds recently traded between 7 and
9 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick suspects some investors have migrated from formerly
hot Internet shares into distressed stocks. ``The people that were
buying eToys, E-Loan, theglobe.com, they need a new game,'' he
said. Distressed stocks ``are very thin, information is scarce and
the people that own them have memories of very high prices when the
company was healthy. It is the perfect place for cynical
manipulators to play.''

DUVAL BURNS UP THE DESERT AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ The Bob Hope Classic often is regarded
as more of a shootout than a standard PGA Tour event. Low numbers
are one thing, but really low numbers are the rule here.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval had one of the lowest in tour history, a 59, in
winning last year's event, and he was at it again during Friday's
third round of the $3 million event. The defending champion was
playing at Indian Wells Country Club, arguably the easiest layout
in the four-course rotation, and shot a 9-under-par 63 to sit three
shots behind leader Rich Beem, who had a 65 for a 54-hole total of
195.
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader David Toms and tour rookie Matt Gogel were in
second place at 197. Toms had a 66 at PGA West and Gogel had a 64,
also at Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, asked if another 59 was possible Friday, said probably
not, although he did miss a two-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed it at some point, I guess,'' he joked, referring to
the 59 he shot last year at the Arnold Palmer Course at PGA West.
``But you could probably make an argument for 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval had seven birdies including four in a row to finish the
round and an eagle at Indian Wells, a par-72, 6,478-yard test that
can yield impressive numbers if the ball is kept in its narrow
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his birdies were inside seven feet and two others were
only inches. His eagle on the par-5, 501-yard 18th hole (his ninth
hole of the day) was a seven-footer after he reached the green in
two with a driver and seven iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first two days, I was five shots behind, but it felt
more like three shots because I had already played the two toughest
courses,'' he said, referring to PGA West and La Quinta Country
Club. ``I came in here today knowing I had a good opportunity to
put up a good number.''
</P>
<P>
   Beem, who once quit the game to sell cellular phones and car
stereo systems, only had one bogey at the 7,060-yard La Quinta
course. He also chipped in for eagle on the par-5, 516-yard fifth
hole and had six birdies.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old didn't even know he had tied a three-round
tournament record (at 195) with his 65 and admitted he was a little
surprised with his performance this week. He earlier had rounds of
67 at Bermuda Dunes and 63 at PGA West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it ... there's not one facet of my game,'' he
said. ``I'm thinking well, I'm swinging good and I'm putting great.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three days have been awesome. I can't imagine I've
been 20-under for three rounds in my life on any course, much less
a tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pleased to be where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Gogel, who is in his first year on tour after four years
on the Nike Tour, now known as the BUY.com Tour. Gogel, who has had
rounds of 66-67-64, is making his second PGA Tour start after
missing the cut at last week's Sony Open in Hawaii. Gogel said that
enabled him to come to the desert earlier than expected and get in
plenty of needed practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel also is one of three rookies playing this week the others
are Casey Martin and Gary Nicklaus _ and he said he enjoys the lack
of attention while Martin, in particular, has been hounded by the
media and has drawn sizable galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very obscure right now walking around the clubhouse,''
Gogel said. ``I think people are more concerned with Hercules
(amateur playing partner/actor Kevin Sorbo). I don't get bothered,
and that's pretty nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tied with Duval for fourth at 198 was Craig Barlow, who barely
kept his PGA card by finishing 124th in winnings last year. Then
came Greg Kraft and veteran Peter Jacobsen, who had a 66 at Indian
Wells, at 199.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, who won this event in 1990 and turns 46 in March,
joked that he was ``thinking of taking up a paper route instead of
doing this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Magee was at 200 along with Hal Sutton (66 at PGA West)
and Rory Sabbatini.

HELMS'S UN BOMBAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Power has its prerogatives, and America's ambassador to the
United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, had compelling practical reasons
to invite the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Jesse Helms, to address the UN Security Council on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Republican has used his chairmanship to
withhold payment of US arrears to the UN, exploiting his
constitutional control of the purse strings to demand reforms and
financial concessions from the UN. As is his wont, Helms made the
executive branch and the UN knuckle under to his demands. With an
adamancy that other countries regard as arrogance, Helms struck a
bargain that offered the UN $926 million of the $1.7 billion it is
owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who this month occupies the rotating presidency of
the Security Council, was emulating the tactful courting of Helms
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has had to practice.
Helms told the assembled ambassadors what he tells the Clinton
administration: Consult with me on my terms or suffer the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   What may be tolerable within the domestic system of checks and
balances should not be transposed to the American role at the UN.
</P>
<P>
   The folly of Helms's lecture to Security Council members derives
not from a break with precedent or a flouting of diplomatic
niceties but from a crucial principle _ that there can be but one
voice to speak for each of the governments represented at the UN.
The institition would not be able to function if voices from the
legislatures or the political oppositions in various nations
proposed to speak for their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Preposterously, that is what Helms pretended he could do. He
repeatedly claimed to be speaking in the name of ``the American
people.'' He said they resent much of what they hear from the UN
and ``have grown increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a
lack of gratitude.'' In fact, overwhelming majorities of Americans
support the UN; Helms speaks only for himself and a parochial
faction of conservatives.

CRASH INVESTIGATORS LOOKING AT 767 TAIL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part
of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane
as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990,
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure comes just a couple days after the chairman of
EgyptAir told a news conference in Cairo that ``something
happened'' to the tail of the Boeing 767 that caused it to go into
a near supersonic dive before the plane broke up and crashed into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board chairman Jim Hall said investigators from his
agency and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority will examine the
767's elevator system, as well as perform a metallurgic examination
of the plane's engine pylon components.
</P>
<P>
   The elevators are flat panels on the horizontal stabalizer of
the tail that control up and down movements of the plane when the
pilot pushes or pulls on the control stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's statement did not suggest that investigators suspect the
elevator system played a role in the crash, and a Boeing spokesman
said such a review is typical in airline crash investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety board is going through a deliberate and methodical
process as they do on all their investigations, and Boeing
continues to support the investigation,'' said Boeing safety
spokesman John Dern.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of problems with the 767's elevator
system or the engine pylons, Dern said.
</P>
<P>
   All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767-300 died when it plunged
into the Atlantic off the Massachusetts coast on Oct. 31, about 30
minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport on a night flight to
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have found nothing in an analysis of the cockpit
voice recorder that would point toward a bomb or a mechanical
problem as the cause of its crash.
</P>
<P>
   Radio communication between the flight crew and air traffic
controllers was routine, and at no time did a member of the crew
advise controllers of either an emergency or a mechanical problem
or concern.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plane's other black box, the flight data
recorder, does not indicate there was an explosion or mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
   That points to another cause, and the leading theory is that the
plane was brought down by a deliberate act of the backup copilot.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Friday, Hall blasted as ``wrong'' a published
report this week that quoted unnamed government officials as saying
a mechanical problem has all but been ruled out as the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``NTSB is disturbed to see that again this week unidentified
sources were used as the basis of a news report purporting to have
informed knowledge of our work,'' Hall said in a statement released
late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As is often the case in these matters, the story was wrong. No
hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted, and
the activities that I have outlined indicate that there is much
that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, with no evidence the crash was an accident, Hall
was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI _ further
fueling the theory of pilot suicide _ when the Egyptian government
strenuously objected.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the safety board has said little about how the
investigation is going.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said substantial portions of the wings, tail, fuselage and
an engine had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday that ``no decision has been reached at this
point whether further wreckage recovery will ultimately be
necessary, and both agencies (the safety board and the Egyptian
Civil Aviation Authority) agree that additional work needs to be be
accomplished before a final decision can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said both agencies also believe that ``aircraft and
operational system issues'' must be investigated further.

A DRUG WAR WITH SIDE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quietly, American involvement in Colombia has grown to a point
where the drug-plagued nation has become the third-largest
recipient of US aid, after Israel and Egypt. Colombia is to receive
$1.6 billion over the next three years to combat narcotics
trafficking, which is being aided and abetted by Marxist guerrillas
who have been battling the government for 40 years. Last week
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright journeyed to Colombia to show
US support for Colombia's embattled government and pledged that the
United States ``will do all that we could to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is money for crop substitution programs and rural
social projects, most will go toward training two battalions of the
Colombian Army and for 30 Blackhawk helicopters that can be used in
anti-insurgency warfare.
</P>
<P>
   We do not doubt General Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, when he says Colombia is in ``an
emergency situation.'' Guerrillas of the right and left control
large tracts of the country, and their protection of
narco-traffickers earns them the money to continue their
rebellions. Narcotics have corrupted the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombian armed forces have not been models for human
rights, and we can sympathize with Amnesty International's Carlos
Salinas when he says: ``We must question whether or not this aid
package is another thinly veiled counterinsurgency program, one
that will deepen the US involvement in this dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, which will have to approve the aid package, should be
vigilant that this effort not go the way of so many other military
assistance programs south of the border that ended up encouraging
repression rather than helping the people. In the end, the answer
to the drug problems of the United States lies in combatting the
demand side at home rather than the supply from abroad.

SETON HALL FIRE SPURS PLANS FOR COMPULSORY SPRINKLERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.J.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ Reacting to Wednesday's fatal fire in a
freshman dormitory at Seton Hall University, New Jersey legislators
said Friday that they would introduce bills requiring automatic
sprinkler systems in all college dorms.
</P>
<P>
   Although New Jersey has required sprinklers in all new buildings
since 1991, Boland Hall, the Seton Hall dorm where three freshman
died in an intense and smoky fire in a third-floor lounge, was
exempt because it was built, in stages, between 1952 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remained about the university's compliance on aspects
of state fire safety laws, which require formal fire drills in
dormitories twice a year. The university has maintained that it is
in compliance, and a spokeswoman said Friday that school officials
were counting evacuations resulting from false alarms as the
equivalent of drills.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Louis Kosco, a Republican who heads the state Senate's Law
and Public Safety Committee, said he hoped to introduce the
sprinkler bill on Monday, when the Legislature meets in joint
session for Gov. Christie Whitman's State of the State address.
Assemblyman Craig Stanley, D-Irvington, whose district includes the
Seton Hall campus, will be co-sponsor of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman ordered her staff Friday to determine howmany buildings
in the state university system were unprotected by sprinklers, and
how much it would cost to install them. Kosco said he was surprised
to learn that two dormitories at Seton Hall _ Boland and Aquinas
Halls _ did not have sprinklers. The university's four other dorms,
all built in the 1980s, have sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately it takes something like this for us legislators
to find out that they are not required,'' Kosco said.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1991, when amendments mandated the systems in all new
buildings, New Jersey's Uniform Fire Safety Act had, since 1984,
required sprinklers only in new buildings 12 stories high or more.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fire, officials at Seton Hall _ a Roman Catholic
institution _ have refused to say whether the school had ever
considered installing sprinklers in Boland, a six-story residence
for about 600 freshmen, and Aquinas, which houses about 280
students from all four classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kosco and Stanley said they planned to seek state financial aid,
through either grants or low-interest loans, for public and private
colleges that wanted to install sprinklers in old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, which has canceled classes until Tuesday afternoon,
continued grappling Friday with the issue of Boland Hall's
compliance with the New Jersey Fire Code requirement for two fire
drills a year. Several times since the fire, Lisa E. Grider, a
university spokeswoman, has said that no formal drills had been
conducted at the dorm.
</P>
<P>
   Students say that false alarms in Boland Hall have been common
pranks for the last several years, especially during final exams.
With each alarm, students evacuated the dorm. Ms. Grider said that
during the fall term there were 18 alarms in Boland and that
students left the building during each of them. She added that the
university believed the evacuations were legal substitutes for the
mandated fire drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consulted our legal experts and they tell me evacuations
are drills,'' Ms. Grider said. ``We are in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the state's Department of
Community Affairs, which oversees administration of the New Jersey
Fire Code, expressed doubt that evacuations caused by false alarms
were the legal equivalent of formal fire drills.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda said that drills must be documented. A university
official must monitor a drill, he said, and the university must
file a report with South Orange's fire department that lists the
time and date of the drill, the number of dorm residents who
participated and the amount of time it took them to leave the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grider said the university had kept records on all
evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, it appears, is not the only university dealing with
spates of false alarms and dorms without sprinklers. After the
Boland fire, the university asked a Washington marketing company,
Lipman Hearne, to conduct a poll of other private and public
colleges about the two issues.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday, Seton Hall said, the company has questioned 57
colleges and universities in eight states and found that 67 percent
had at least one dorm without a sprinkler system and that 37
percent considered false alarms a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the Essex County prosecutor's office and
other agencies finished their examination of fire debris and burn
patterns in Boland's third-floor lounge Friday and said it could be
reopened. Whether the fire's origin was accidental or arson
remained unknown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As part of the investigation, Donald Campolo, the Essex County
prosecutor, has subpoenaed all documents that South Orange
officials have kept on Boland Hall since 1984, including fire
safety and building code inspections, said the town counsel, Edwin
Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grider of Seton Hall said she did not know if any university
records had been subpoenaed, but that anything Campolo requested
would be provided. ``The university is in complete cooperation with
the investigation,'' she said.

HORROR NEEDS NO HYPE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The media should take a collective pledge on coverage of the
Michael Skakel case: no sensationalism, just responsible news
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz that the approaching murder trial will be another O.J.
Simpson circus _ the first big celebrity crime story of the century
_ should send members of the press deep into the book ``Warp Speed:
America in the Age of Mixed Media,'' by Bill Kovach and Tom
Rosenstiel. The authors warn how fueling such mega media events
erodes the principles of good journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Urging restraint may be as effective as spitting into a hail
storm, but we hope the Skakel proceedings are not allowed to grow
into a mega event. Report it, yes _ obviously this week's break in
a nearly 25-year-old case warrants attention _ but keep it in
perspective so rumors published by irresponsible news outlets do
not drive the coverage in the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in the reporting of the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
the death of Princess Diana, the Simpson case, and other stories
that seemed to get bigger and louder, but not necessarily clearer,
with each passing news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy name, however distant, stirs the media whirlwind in
the Skakel case, for Michael Skakel is Ethel Kennedy's nephew.
That, plus wealth _ the murder scene was a gated community in
Greenwich, Conn. _ creates the supposed ``magic'' threatening to
turn into another blockbuster with stakeouts in neighbors'
driveways and revelations from people who knew people who knew the
victim and the accused. Or who claim to.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go there, ladies and gentlemen of the press! Take a deep
breath and repeat the words of Michael Sherman, who is Skakel's
attorney: ``This is not a Kennedy trial. This is not an O.J. trial.
It's a trial for a man charged with killing his next-door
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley, 14, was bludgeoned and stabbed to death with a golf club
on Oct. 30, 1975. Skakel, 15, was rumored to be a suspect. Now, at
age 39, his fate will be decided in the courts. The media should
report what happens without hype. Such horror and loss needs no
embellishment.

OIL'S SLIPPERY ECONOMIC ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another surge in the price of oil has reawakened concern about
potential economic ripple effects, even though there has been
little indication so far of the kind of dislocations that
accompanied past price spikes. Consumers _ individuals and
businesses alike _ will do well to keep up their conservation
efforts, which have already helped insulate the economy from damage
by high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil in recent weeks has reached levels not seen since the
early 1990s. The rise has been particularly dramatic in contrast
with prices just a year ago. Last week, for example, some crude oil
traded above $29 a barrel; little more than a year ago the price
was less than $9.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of oil on the American economy has diminished over
the past decade. A recent survey by The Wall Street Journal pointed
out that oil represents only about 3 percent of gross domestic
output, compared with 8.5 percent in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is being used much more efficiently than at the time of the
first oil price shock in 1973, as shown by the automobile. The
average fuel economy for all cars then was 14 miles per gallon.
Today the average mileage is a tad above 20, even given the
popularity of sport utility vehicles and larger pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in prices is directly traceable to the success of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in curbing oil
production, which glutted the market in 1998. The rise in prices
has made it easier for OPEC to maintain the discipline of quotas,
since the flow of money has risen while output has fallen. But in
the long run it is not in OPEC's interests to pursue price
increases so large that they would disrupt the economies of its
customers, who would then buy less oil, which in turn would reduce
prices and weaken OPEC's discipline on quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been given a practical demonstration of the
usefulness of conservation in preserving stability in the face of
aggressive supply and price policies by OPEC and other producers.
The United States should seek even greater efficiencies in the
future.

SAY IT WITH SMARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the time of year when everybody's got an
opinion about the Super Bowl and who's going to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not everybody. Which is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   January can be a difficult month for people who haven't been
following the NFL this season, don't know the no-throat-slashing
rule from the Cider House rules and get lost in all the talk of
office Super Bowl pools. It can be even more painful for those who
work and live with such people and have to keep explaining where
Kurt Warner came from.
</P>
<P>
   For those who just hope to bluff their way through the next 10
days, we offer a clip-and-save guide to what to say if you want to
sound like a knowledgeable, up-to-date football fan:
</P>
<P>
   Say: I can't get behind the Rams since they abandoned the loyal
fans in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Say: I'm rooting for the Rams players, but not for their
management.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: Maybe the success of an honest, plucky, hard-working
executive like Georgia Frontiere will inspire more women to pursue
careers in sports management.
</P>
<P>
   Say: The fact that none of the four teams in Sunday's NFC and
AFC finals has won a Super Bowl, and only the Rams have ever
!ital!played in a Super Bowl, suggests that parity has finally
taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Say: It's not parity when one playoff team beats another 62-7.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: Sixty-two points! How many Lambeau Leaps did they
do?
</P>
<P>
   Say: This wouldn't be happening if John Elway were still
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Say: This wouldn't be happening if Vince Lombardi were still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: This wouldn't be happening if Mike Ditka were still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Say: You know the '90s were a decade of change in the NFL when,
among the conference finalists, Tampa Bay's franchise has
represented its city longer (24 years) than the others combined
have represented theirs (13).
</P>
<P>
   Say: The evolution of pro football is personified by players
like Rams tackle Orlando Pace, a 300-pounder with mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: Do I look fat?
</P>
<P>
   Say: You know it's a crazy season when Kurt Warner is going to
the Super Bowl and Brett Favre, Steve Young, Troy Aikman and Dan
Marino are sitting home.
</P>
<P>
   Say: It all began in September when Vinnie Testaverde and
Terrell Davis got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: Where did Kurt Warner come from?
</P>
<P>
   Say: I bet the Rams, laying the 13, and the unders, because,
although I allow for the possibility Tampa Bay's good defense will
slow St. Louis' good offense, I can't see Tampa Bay scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Say: I took the Jaguars, giving 7, and the overs, because a
balanced and rested Jacksonville attack is going to frustrate the
Tennessee defense.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: I was going to buy the squares on the far left,
because I'm left-handed, but I wound up buying the squares on the
far right, because that seemed like the ``right'' thing to do, get
it? How often does a game end with a score of 15-5, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Say: This is the worst NFL postseason for the TV networks since
the ``Heidi'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Say: I don't care if the networks prefer big-city teams _ I'm
inspired by the rise of the underdogs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: It's just too bad Ryan Leaf isn't getting a shot at
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Say: No matter what happens in the Super Bowl, the most
memorable moment of the season will remain the Titans' last-ditch
kickoff return against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Say: Thank goodness for instant replay it showed the refs got
the call right.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: NFL referee that's a job I'd like to have.
</P>
<P>
   Say: The fact Tennessee handed Jacksonville its only
regular-season losses is misleading the first meeting was played in
a Florida rainstorm and Fred Taylor sat out with a groin injury,
and the second might have been the result of a Jaguars letdown
since they'd clinched a playoff berth, had only to beat Cincinnati
in the season's final week to clinch home field, and lost
quarterback Mark Brunell early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Say: The difference between the Rams and Bucs can be summed up
by the fact Kurt Warner was the highest-rated quarterback going
into the playoffs and Shaun King the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Do not say: Where did Kurt Warner come from?
</P>
<P>
   The absolute best thing to say if you want to sound like you
know football: This is the weirdest pro-football winter since the
Icky Shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute worst thing to say if you want to sound like you
know football: Rams-Titans in the Super Bowl? I picked them in
September!

BEEM ENJOYS HIS DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT, FROM THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ Rich Beem, who tied the 54-hole
tournament record at 195, held a one-stroke lead at 20 under par
after Friday's third round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. But
many players were still in contention, including David Duval, the
defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gogel, a tour rookie, was in second place at 19 under par,
while David Toms was tied with Duval for third place at 18 under
par.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 6-under-par 66, and keeping pace with the birdie
barrage that makes this tournament an unpredictable shootout, Peter
Jacobsen was tied for fifth place heading into this weekend's final
two rounds of the 90-hole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Jacobsen, who was winning golf tournaments long
before Duval joined the PGA Tour, was would he be able to outplay
Duval this weekend? Jacobsen said he planned to have fun trying.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jacobsen was tied with Craig Barlow at 17 under par,
close enough to think about winning, which is something Jacobsen
has not done since 1995. Last weekend, Paul Azinger won for the
first time since 1993. And Jacobsen, who will be 46 in March, would
love to follow Azinger to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make predictions about whether I'm going to
win again, or even break par tomorrow,'' said Jacobsen, who shot a
66 at the Indian Wells Country Club. ``I'm thinking about maybe
taking up a paper route instead of doing this stuff. I'm not sure I
can beat Tiger Woods. I'm glad he's not playing this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way, I'm real happy with the way I'm playing. If I
putt well, I have a chance to contend.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will have to keep making birdies, because the four
courses on which the tournament is played are shorter than most
tour courses, and conditions have been almost prefect. Beem's
three-round total equaled the mark set by Andrew Magee in 1998, yet
Beem, who shot a 65 at Bermuda Dunes Friday, knew that his lead was
far from safe.
</P>
<P>
   How player-friendly is this tournament? Two weeks ago, Beem
finished last at the Mercedes Championships and shot an
opening-round 84. Last weekend at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Beem
missed the cut. Obviously, this tournament is a good place to
regain your confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine I've been 20 under par for three rounds in my
life on any golf course, much less a tour event,'' said Beem, who
won last year's Kemper Open. ``I had not made a whole lot of
birdies this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Beem and everyone else will be keeping a close eye on
Duval, who won last year's tournament by shooting a final-round 59
at Bermuda Dunes. Friday, Duval shot a 63 at Indian Wells, and when
Duval is playing well on a course that he enjoys, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I have a good chance,'' said Duval, who won four
times in 1999, but who has not won since last April. ``I missed a
couple of putts I could've made. I don't know if I could've gotten
to 59, but you could probably make an argument for 60. Seeing as
I'm only two behind now, I feel like I have a very good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Casey Martin was in danger of missing the cut, after
Friday's 71 left him 4-under par for the tournament. The 72-hole
cut will be made after Saturday's round, with only the top 70 and
ties advancing to Sunday. Martin ended Friday's round tied for
89th, so he will need to make a move to reach the final round.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 holes left, there will be many more birdies, and much
more movement on the leader board. But Jacobsen was glad to be part
of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about taking up a paper route instead of doing
this stuff,'' joked Jacobsen, a six-time winner on tour. ``I've
played the tour for 24 years, I've had a good solid career, I've
been smart enough to keep my money in the bank. Now, I'm playing
simply to win.''

KINGS LEAVE IMPRINT ON SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The players were gone and the truck was packed for
the final time.
</P>
<P>
   But as coach Andy Murray walked back to his empty office Friday
on the Los Angeles Kings' last day at the Iceoplex in North Hills,
he was stopped by a man with a pen and a request.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a goalie stick left over for the man's young son, who
had taken up hockey in one of the many leagues available to San
Fernando Valley kids since the place opened nine years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Murray had just finished a hard practice with his team, one
night after their woeful 5-2 loss to the Dallas Stars. The memory
was still painful more than 12 hours later. But in the spirit of a
game that often has looked out of place in Southern California,
Murray complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, it's like it is back in Canada in this
place, a place where you can meet the players while they're
working,'' said Kings winger Luc Robitaille, who is a minority
owner of the Iceoplex. ``That's how you pass down a sport, by
taking the time to meet the fans and the kids. You always felt that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Kings players and staff are as nostalgic about the
Iceoplex as Robitaille. Many now live in the South Bay and are
eager to open the team's new practice facility in El Segundo called
Health South, which the Kings will share with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iceoplex, located north of the Van Nuys airport and just
west of Tommy's and the Budweiser plant on Roscoe Boulevard, isn't
going anywhere. And it certainly does have a legacy in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a barometer for a sport that boomed when Wayne
Gretzky took the Kings to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993 and soured
when the team failed to make the playoffs five of the next six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Iceoplex helped expand hockey in an area that
has added ice rinks in Panorama City, Sylmar and Simi Valley, with
another scheduled to open in Valencia. Since Iceoplex opened, the
number of youth and adult club teams there has nearly doubled from
the original 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving, but the best part is the sport is still
growing,'' Kings captain Rob Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   After Gretzky arrived, mid-week practices were standing-room
only. The lobby of the 35,000-square foot converted warehouse was
as hot as any night club.
</P>
<P>
   When the team began to struggle, the bar and the restaurant were
closed. The facility, which was built for $1.5 million by
Robitaille and two partners in 1991, catered to the Kings by day,
but mostly to figure skaters and late-night amateur hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell how the Kings are doing by the traffic
coming through here,'' said Lisa Sakata, Iceoplex manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first opened and then when the Kings went to the
Stanley Cup, you couldn't move in this place. There obviously were
some down years for the team, but there was a good feeling before
this season and there were a lot of fans here for training camp
last summer. It's sad to see them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Iceoplex has been the best place in town to be if you wanted to
meet a professional athlete. Security was kept to a minimum to let
fans mingle with players. It gave the casual observer a chance to
see the all-time greats like Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, whose
jersey No.66 is displayed in the hockey office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my son here once to meet Wayne Gretzky,'' said Janet
Keegan of North Hollywood. ``We went up to him for an autograph and
he treated my son like Bobby was the star. Neither of us ever
forgot that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iceoplex also gave the diehards a chance to take their
frustrations right to the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a young woman after practice in a team jersey who
kept yelling for me to play Pavel Rosa more,'' said Murray,
referring to the Kings' popular but seldom-used forward. ``Somehow
she got my cell-phone number and she kept after me. Don't tell me
they don't love their hockey here.''

<P>
   CEDAR KNOLLS, N.J. _ In the mid-1980s, when video cameras cost
$1,000 and were bulky contraptions carried on the shoulder, James
Wickstead wondered if there was a way to make a small, rudimentary
$100 model for children.
</P>
<P>
   Wickstead, an inventor with a small design business here, posed
the question at a brainstorming pizza party for his engineers.
Within a few days, they said they could do it _ if they could find
a way to record the sound and images on an inexpensive
Walkman-style cassette. And, several patents later, they had done
it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the PXL 2000, or Pixelvision, a black-and-white
video camera introduced with much fanfare in 1987 by Fisher-Price
at the International Toy Fair in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The early success was illusory. For a variety of reasons, the
company stopped making the plastic cameras a year after they
appeared in stores. Pixelvision appeared to be headed for the scrap
heap of discarded media _ the final resting place of punch cards,
eight-track tapes, 5\-inch floppy disks, and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But then, over the last decade, Pixelvision was rediscovered,
not by children, but by a cultish corps of low-budget filmmakers
who have fallen in love with the camera's grainy, shimmering,
monochrome imagery, and with its lens, which allows the user to
dive to within an eighth of an inch of a subject and pull back to a
long shot without touching a dial, as the background and the
foreground remain in focus.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is even making its way into mainstream efforts,
including a film that will be shown Sunday at the Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Wickstead is happy to see his creation being appropriated by
professionals, but he is still dead set on getting Pixelvision back
into the hands of children. He said he was close to nailing down a
deal with a company to introduce a new incarnation that used color.
</P>
<P>
   In a back room at his offices here, one of his engineers
recently bent over a circuit board, adding finishing touches to the
design. ``The technology is ready,'' Wickstead said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short market life of the original Pixelvision, several
hundred thousand were sold for $100 to $200, depending on the
accessories, Wickstead said. Now, when one of the cameras pops up
on eBay, the Internet auction site, aficionados snatch them up,
sometimes bidding more than $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has become a case study of how a technology can be
invented for one use and then tugged in an entirely unexpected
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Fisher-Price headquarters in East Aurora, N.Y, near
Buffalo, company officials said they still received several
inquiries a year from filmmakers _ often from overseas _ seeking a
Pixelvision camera. ``It's really quite amazing,'' said Laurie
Oravec, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She said the camera was introduced in a push to sell more toys
for older children, but it never caught on in a big way. For
heavily promoted mass-market toys, Ms. Oravec said, big is
essential. And shortly after Pixelvision was developed, she said,
the toy maker was sold by its parent company, Quaker Oats, and
decided to return to simple toys for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Wickstead, 58, said he was excited to see the camera poised to
get a second chance. But he said his main goal was still to get
Pixelvision into the hands of children, not avant-garde filmmakers.
And the inventor, who counts Bergman among his favorite filmmakers,
said that Pixelvision purists should not worry about the color.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a flip of a switch,'' he said, ``you'll still get black
and white.''  &QL;

NEW YORK VS. SAN ANTONIO: FOR KNICKS, A FEW WHAT IFS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (budgeted earlier as BKN-KNICKS-EWING)  
 (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It was here, in the hangar-sized spaces of the
Alamodome, where a dispirited Patrick Ewing squirmed in his seat
like a moviegoer willing the outcome of a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   And he was just that helpless. Ewing watched the large and
looming David Robinson and Tim Duncan close in on the New York
Knicks like walls from a claustrophobic nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Through the National Basketball Association finals, the duo
simply suffocated the Knicks in the paint. In what was the most
frustrating moment of his career, there was no way Ewing could step
in to stop them. Not with his lower leg locked in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   But, what if? As Ewing peeled the ice bags off his body after
the Knicks' practice session at the Alamodome on Friday, as he
glanced up at the championship banner hanging over the Spurs'
court, he wondered what might have happened if he had been healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it have made a difference? Yeah,'' said Ewing whose team
bowed out in the finals, four games to one. ``Would we have won it?
Who knows? They were a lot bigger than we were. So, definitely, it
would have helped if we had been able to score a little more in the
paint. They are the world champs. They deserved it; they won it. I
wish I could have played and things could have worked out
differently, but it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that transpires Saturday _ when the two teams meet for
the first time in the regular season since the finals _ will take
away the sting from last June. It does not matter how well Ewing
holds up against Robinson and Duncan, how easily Latrell Sprewell
slips around a Spurs' team that is not the same without Sean
Elliott or what the final score is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no revenge from last year,'' said coach Jeff Van
Gundy. ``It's not like if we beat them now, we get the championship
trophy from last year. I do think the way we started playing well
last year came when we started beating very good teams on the road.
That would be a great way to jump-start this year on the road:
having success against the defending champions and a very elite
team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Spurs are not as dominant right now as they were at the
finish of last season. They have lost 12 of their last 23 games and
miss the offense and defense Elliott provided. Perhaps Elliott can
complete a miraculous comeback from the kidney transplant he had
last summer, but the Spurs are not expecting him to return soon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks are wary. They saw how punishing Robinson and
Duncan could be last season. After stepping over the gimpy Larry
Johnson and bulling by the wispy Marcus Camby through the five
games of the finals, Duncan averaged 27.4 points and 14 rebounds
and Robinson kicked in 16.6 points and 11.8 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' formula worked perfectly because Robinson was willing
to submerge his ego and step into a supporting role for arguably
the best player in the game: the shot-blocking, bank-shot artist,
Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David is a very good player and has been a very good
player his whole career,'' Ewing said. ``He was a great player for
them last year. Tim scored more than he did. But without David,
they wouldn't have won.''
</P>
<P>
   With that concept in mind, many wondered if the Knicks' aging
superstar, Ewing, would play a Robinson-like role on a team with
the rising Camby, Sprewell and Allan Houston. In some ways, albeit
begrudgingly, Ewing has stepped back this season. While he is not
always pleased with his less glamorous position, he has yet to
publicly complain about his shrinking star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just putting last year behind me and concentrating on this
year,'' Ewing said. ``I'm just trying to be the best player I can
and help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks need him in a big way. As much as the Knicks tried to
deliver a championship last season without Ewing, they never had
the size to match the Spurs and never had the inside presence to
make Robinson and Duncan work a little harder to dominate
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what the outcome would have been,'' Ewing said. ``I
wish I could have played, but I wasn't able to.''
</P>
<P>
   All he could do was squirm in his seat. He was on the bench and
in a suit that probably felt as confining as a straitjacket. After
14 years of putting in the effort, after a decade of title dreams
cut short, an injury kept Ewing out of the Spurs' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating,'' Ewing said. ``Sitting down,
watching and knowing that if you were able to play, you could help.
It was tough.''

<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's board of directors met Friday to consider
stepping up merger talks with two pharmaceutical giants, American
Home Products and Warner-Lambert, that would create one of the
world's largest consumer products and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   As with any negotiations, no deal is guaranteed. And it was not
clear Friday night whether the Procter &AMP; Gamble board would decide
to pursue talks with either of the companies. But several people
close to the talks said they anticipated that the board would allow
the three companies to continue discussions that started this week.
Executives for all three companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, maker of Tide and Pampers, is already the
nation's largest consumer products company, and has a
pharmaceuticals business that is dwarfed by those of the big drug
companies. If Procter &AMP; Gamble combined all three pharmaceutical
businesses, the new drug business would be the second-largest
prescription drug seller in the United States. Only Glaxo
SmithKline, the company created by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham, which announced their intentions to merge on Monday, would
sell more prescription drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street reacted nervously. Procter &AMP; Gamble's stock fell
9 percent Friday, to $102.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a merger with two drug giants would be a dramatic
departure for a historically conservative company. Procter &AMP; Gamble
would be betting that it could apply its powerful marketing and
distribution methods to help the pharmaceutical firms do a better
job of selling their products, which can carry a higher profit
margin than other consumer products. Warner-Lambert's products
include Lipitor, the cholesterol-reducing drug that is expected to
become the largest-selling drug in the world, as well as Trident
gum and Schick razors; American Home's include Advil, Robitussin
and and Premarin, a hormone replacement drug.
</P>
<P>
   American Home and Warner-Lambert announced that they would merge
in a $78 billion stock deal last November. But Pfizer Inc., a
competitor that makes Viagra and Zoloft, made a hostile bid for
Warner-Lambert in November with the hope of wresting that company
from its embrace with American Home.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Steele, a consumer products analyst at Banc of
America Securities, said that a deal with the two drug companies
would satisfy some of what Procter &AMP; Gamble executives consider
important when looking at possible acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense that Procter and Gamble would look at this
deal,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Durk I. Jager, Procter &AMP; Gamble's chairman, has vowed to shake
things up at Procter &AMP; Gamble. At the company's annual meeting in
October, for instance, Jager closed the meeting with these words to
shareholders: ``A few years from now P&AMP;G will be a very different
kind of company than it is today, still based on our core values
and principles, but totally different in almost every other
respect. We will be faster, more experimental, more open, more
collaborative _ inside and out, more unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Wednesday, when The Wall Street Journal first
reported that discussions had begun, analysts have been relatively
skeptical that such a deal would happen. And it is possible that if
the talks continue, Procter &AMP; Gamble could decide it wants only one
of the two companies, possibly American Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see many synergies. Marketing is not enough,'' said
Sergio Traversa, at Mehta Partners, an investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But shares in Procter &AMP; Gamble are down more than 12 percent for
the week, suggesting that traders believe that the company is
serious about making an offer for either one or both of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the discussions may put more pressure on Pfizer to
come up with a higher bid than the $78 billion offered to
Warner-Lambert shareholders last November. People close to the
talks said Pfizer executives were approached by Warner-Lambert
representatives about raising their bid. And one person close to
Pfizer said the company would be willing to raise its bid if it
made sense to do so, a posture the company has taken all along.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure: If the companies are combined, consumers may
find themselves overwhelmed with television ads for Warner-Lambert
and American Home's prescription drugs. Procter &AMP; Gamble is adept
at selling products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies are now making advertising to consumers
a key to their business strategies. Last year, the drug companies
spent almost $1.9 billion on consumer advertising, according to
Scott-Levin, an industry consulting firm, up from $720 million in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Drug analysts said they did not think Procter &AMP; Gamble would be
willing to make such a big acquisition because of how it would
lower future earnings. If indeed Procter &AMP; Gamble is successful,
analysts said there would be little antitrust concern because, with
the exception of a few consumer products, there is little overlap
in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Neil B. Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.,
said he did not believe that P&AMP;G would want to get into a bidding
war for Warner-Lambert with Pfizer. And, if it bought American
Home, it would also inherit that company's potential liabilities of
billions of dollars from lawsuits filed by people who said they
were harmed by the drug combination fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, drug analysts are still betting that Pfizer would
win the escalating battle for Warner-Lambert. ``Bill Steere wants
Warner-Lambert,'' Traversa, the analyst at Mehta Partners, said of
Pfizer's chairman. ``And, Pfizer has the muscle.''

CARDINAL'S LIGHT HAND AS LEADER LETS N.Y. ARCHDIOCESE ADAPT TO
ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To New Yorkers accustomed to hearing Cardinal John
O'Connor speak out on moral issues, the most glaring consequence of
his illness has been his sudden shrinking from the public pulpit he
built in his 16 years as archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   But his illness has also touched his other, lesser-known role:
administrator of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, a
spiritual, educational, social and financial presence. O'Connor's
style of leadership urged independence on those who worked for him,
helping them to soldier in much the same way that the timeworn
grooves of the church itself do.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the cardinal became ill, running the archdiocese was
no simple feat. With 2.4 million members, it covers Manhattan,
Staten Island, the Bronx and seven counties north of the city. It
includes hundreds of parishes, schools, hospitals, nursing homes,
maternity homes, day care centers and shelters that are run
directly by the archdiocese or by religious orders that are
financially independent but report to the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   When the cardinal's energy began to wane, he left the details of
management and most public appearances to two lieutenants, known as
vicars general, and to other bishops, reserving his stamina for the
most important issues. The vicars general ran the cardinal's weekly
cabinet meetings, during which 25 to 30 department heads gather
every Tuesday morning to report on major developments, until last
week, when the cardinal returned to the table.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The vicars general, Bishops Patrick Sheridan and Robert Brucato,
continued to bring important decisions to O'Connor, but they also
reminded those seeking the cardinal's advice to bear his condition
in mind and use their judgment before troubling him. Functioning as
gatekeepers was not entirely new for them. Normally, memorandums,
letters and other communications to the cardinal, whose office is
on the 20th floor of the archdiocese's headquarters at First Avenue
and 55th Street, come through the vicars generals' offices one
floor below.
</P>
<P>
   Over its long history, experts on religion said, the church has
established ways to function despite the illness or absence of its
leaders, making no single person crucial at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coming and going of the cardinal doesn't disrupt this
machinery,'' Brucato, 68, a former chancellor of the New York
Archdiocese, said in an interview in the rectory behind St.
Patrick's Cathedral. Asked just how the archdiocese keeps
functioning in O'Connor's absence, Brucato cocked his head toward
Bishop Sheridan, seated next to him, and said, ``He growls, and I
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, he said, the two men live in the archbishop's
residence behind the cathedral, and have known the cardinal for
many years. They eat breakfast together every day. ``We know his
policies,'' Brucato said. ``We know his mind. His authority is
vested in us, to implement what he would want implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   While most dioceses have a single vicar general, New York is one
of the few in the United States with two. Brucato joined Sheridan,
who is 78, in August, working largely on the transition phase of
the cardinal's impending retirement. The bishops said the naming of
a second vicar general was not related to the cardinal's illness,
but as it turns out, they have both filled in for him, as have
monsignors throughout the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vast, vast operation,'' Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The operation resembles few others. Despite common perceptions
of the Catholic Church as monolithic, its organization in New York
is diffuse. Each parish is incorporated as a separate nonprofit
entity headed by the archbishop, with the local priest serving as
secretary-treasurer. In daily operations, the priest runs the
parish, largely without consulting the archdiocese. Each parish is
responsible for expenses and projects within its geographic area,
and for sending 15 percent of its donations to the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming archbishop, O'Connor has run the complex
apparatus of the archdiocese by granting the heads of major
departments great latitude and authority. They report major
developments to him, and to each other, at the weekly cabinet
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't give piddly stuff, but the important stuff,'' said
Msgr. Thomas Bergin, who runs educational programs for the
archdiocese. As examples of important matters, the monsignor cited
school consolidation questions and labor union negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The meetings also represent a chance for the different arms of
the archdiocese to coordinate their actions, like lobbying on
behalf of issues that could affect the archdiocese, said Joseph
Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Zwilling said, ``if there's a piece of legislation
in Albany that would have an effect on Medicare rates for
hospitals, there might be an extended discussion about the
legislation, and whether there is something that he as cardinal
should be doing about that.'' The head of hospitals, Mary
Healey-Sedutto, ``might say, `Yes, it would be helpful if you
called this person or wrote that,''' Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's style of running the meetings has served the
archdiocese well during the months that he has been convalescing
from surgery to remove a brain tumor and the follow-up radiation
treatments, church officials said, because it cultivated their
independence. Until O'Connor returned to his office in recent
weeks, he worked from his home behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. When
he resumed presiding over the cabinet meetings, he listened to
updates from the two dozen department chiefs in attendance and
surprised them with questions showing that he had kept up with
their work throughout his absence, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been determined to be, and has been, the archbishop of
New York every day,'' Zwilling said. ``He's never pulled back one
little bit from that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Msgr. James Murray, the head of Catholic Charities, that
dedication was most starkly illustrated one morning last fall. Not
long before, the cardinal had been released from the hospital,
where he had been treated for fatigue. But that morning, he
traveled to Wall Street for a fund-raising breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   There, he told Wall Street financiers of the other New Yorkers,
the ones untouched by the blessings of an economic boom: families
shredded by violence, men cut adrift by drugs, infants with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Murray said, Catholic Charities walked away with
donations totaling more than $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the worst days since his surgery, the cardinal stopped
receiving priests at his residence on Wednesdays, a day he had
always left open for them to visit him unannounced. He also stopped
attending the funerals of priests, which he had done since becoming
archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, the cardinal has reopened his home to the
parish priests, and he works five to six hours a day at his office.
When it comes to strategic decisions, however, he has avoided
taking steps that would tie his successor's hands in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The next archbishop is likely to be named soon. Last Saturday,
O'Connor celebrated his 80th birthday at a charity fund-raising
dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria. The milestone was especially
important because Pope John Paul II has generally not allowed
cardinals to serve long past that age, when they lose their right
to vote in papal elections.
</P>
<P>
   In these waning days of his tenure, O'Connor's sudden quiet has
been striking, Sheridan said, especially for a leader whose
trademark has been speaking out on pressing moral and political
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the place are stopping us and asking us, `How
is the cardinal? Tell him I'm praying for him,''' the bishop said.
``They don't know who I am from Tuesday, but this is the public out
there reacting that way, so they're aware of his illness and his
absence.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, and looked down. ``Nonetheless,'' he said, ``his
presence is still here.''

POLITICIANS PROTEST MARITAL FIDELITY QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As City Hall protests go, it was far from routine.
Friday, when 10 of New York City's Democratic politicians gathered
in the rotunda outside Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office, the point
was to defend a Republican mayor and attack the media for its
treatment of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Manhattan
Democrat, who led the group in calling for the news media to stop
asking questions about the marital fidelity of any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the questions that have been asked of Mrs. Clinton go
beyond the pale,'' said Ms. Maloney. ``Mayor Giuliani is right in
saying there are questions he will not answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maloney said she intended to create a ``media watch'' to
monitor reporters covering the Senate campaign and to catalog the
number of what she called inappropriate questions.
</P>
<P>
   The group of Democrats included two men, both City Council
members, and was dominated by some of the council's most outspoken
advocates of women's rights, including Kathryn Freed, Christine
Quinn and Margarita Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the protest was prompted by the persistent
questioning of Mrs. Clinton in Buffalo on Wednesday by a radio talk
show host, who asked if she had been unfaithful to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also said they supported the position of Giuliani,
who said he would not answer questions about his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He has lashed out at reporters who have asked about the
infrequent public appearances he has made in recent years with his
wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a 100 percent supporter of Hillary, but I will defend the
mayor on the same principle,'' Ms. Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, the mayor's spokeswoman, said Giuliani had made
his opinion clear, and she noted that the two candidates agreed on
this point.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, asked again Friday about the queries into her
personal life, said: ``I knew when I entered this race that there
would be people who might ask inappropriate questions. That's not
going to deter me.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both candidates would not respond directly to Ms.
Maloney's plan for a media watch, in which the congresswoman, a
political ally of Mrs. Clinton, who represents sections of
Manhattan and Queens, said she planned to write to the Senate
candidates asking them to contact her whenever they think a
reporter has asked an inappropriate question about their personal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   She first said she would return to City Hall each week with a
report of those journalists considered to be offenders, but later
said she did not know if there would be sufficient responses from
the candidates to warrant such frequent news briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she planned to amass the information, she said she did
not plan to use her staff or government funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably just do this myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bode, the dean of the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University, said that Ms. Maloney's proposal was close
to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political candidates are asked a lot of questions that make
you cringe, and the proper way for them to handle the situation is
to tell the reporter to take a hike,'' he said. ``Nobody in
Congress needs to set themselves up as an intermediary, and nobody
needs to serve as the goddess of propriety.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American companies are reporting a surge in profits, giving
investors reason to hope that the aging bull market may have more
life left.
</P>
<P>
   With companies from Warner-Lambert to America Online turning in
strong results, overall earnings growth for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 is on track to exceed 17 percent in 1999. The trend accelerated
in the second half of the year. Earnings rose more than 22 percent
in the third quarter and are now looking up about 21 percent in the
fourth, although many companies have not yet reported.
</P>
<P>
   That growth rate is three times the long-term average of 7
percent, and a sharp increase from 1998, when earnings barely rose
in large part because of the Asian financial crisis and the General
Motors strike. Furthermore, fourth-quarter results have handily
surpassed the expectations of industry analysts on Wall Street,
indicating a stronger economy than expected just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those same industry analysts are projecting 17 percent growth in
earnings in 2000, said Charles Hill, director of research for First
Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analyst estimates. ``I think
the die is cast through at least the first half of 2000 that we're
going to get good earnings reports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, who are increasingly nervous about lofty stock
prices and rising interest rates, the earnings growth provides
reason for optimism. Although even bullish stock market strategists
say that rising interest rates may well crimp stocks for the next
couple of months, stocks track corporate earnings over the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, ``you've got the classic tug-of-war with
worries over rising rates against better-than-expected earnings,''
said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Lehman
Brothers. ``But basically at the end of the road, you've got a very
strong set of fundamentals that leads to a bull market that is now
10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, who for the last five years has been one of Wall
Street's most consistently bullish _ and correct _ strategists,
remains a bull. He says stocks should turn in double-digit
percentage gains for the year, although there could be a sharp
selloff along the way because of interest rate fears.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are considered bad for stocks, because
they raise the cost of doing business and depress corporate
earnings and because higher yields make bonds relatively more
attractive than stocks to investors. As the rate on the 30-year
Treasury bond has risen from less than 5 percent in 1998 to 6.7
percent currently, the gap between bond yields and stock prices has
loomed ever larger. Stocks are trading at historically high
multiples of earnings, with the S&AMP;P 500 now selling for 25 times
its estimated 2000 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, investing one dollar in a Treasury bond
guarantees a return of almost seven cents next year, while
investing one dollar in the stock market buys only four cents of
earnings. Of course, the stocks could appreciate far more, but
generally speaking, stock investors are buying a stream of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the earnings stream on bonds and stocks have been
roughly comparable. When they diverge, investors generally see
opportunity in the cheaper asset, which in this case is bonds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors are staying in stocks, counting on future
earnings growth to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with technology
companies, the relationship between earnings growth and valuations
is even more striking. After gaining 86 percent last year, the
Nasdaq stock basket trades at 125 times its companies' earnings of
the last 12 months, according to Joseph Abbott, senior equity
strategist at IBES International.
</P>
<P>
   That level is roughly eight times the historical average,
leading some investors to worry that the United States is in a
Japan-like stock market bubble. Japan's stock market roared ahead
in the 1980s, fueled by a real estate frenzy and a belief that
Japanese companies were far ahead of their foreign competitors,
before crashing in 1990 as interest rates rose. A decade later, the
stock market remains 50 percent off its 1989 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nasdaq composite is extremely expensive, its
companies are expected to grow 63 percent in 2000, about nine times
the average growth in corporate earnings for the last 50 years
recorded by First Call. Strong productivity increases, fast
economic growth in the United States and massive investments in
technology are driving the increase, said Robert Froehlich, chief
investment strategist at Kemper Funds, which manages $40 billion in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unbelievable amount of pent-up demand for
technology,'' Froehlich said. ``In addition, productivity is
increasing, and that's not going to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength in earnings sweeps across almost every sector of
the economy, said Hill of First Call. Helped by high oil prices,
energy companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings about double
their 1998 levels. Financial companies are showing gains of roughly
30 percent, while technology companies, which were expected to be
slowed as big customers cut spending in the fall because of fears
of yearend computer problems, are reporting gains of 20 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott of IBES said he was particularly impressed that fewer
companies than usual had warned of earnings disappointments for the
fourth quarter, while more companies had surpassed analysts'
estimates. Although some major companies, notably Lucent
Technologies, came in far short of expectations, the overall number
of negative announcements was the lowest in the five years that
IBES has tracked quarterly warnings, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Another especially promising sign is the amount by which
companies have exceeded analysts' expectations for the fourth
quarter. Companies often guide Wall Street analysts to slightly
lower profits than their internal expectations. As a result,
companies typically report earnings gains that surpass analysts'
estimates by about 3 percent, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, corporate results so far have been 7
percent ahead of expectations, Hill said. ``It's clear we're going
to beat the numbers by more than we normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some strategists remain wary that high interest rates may
derail the stock market. Christine Callies, chief U.S. market
strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, predicts that the Federal
Reserve will continue to raise short-term rates until stocks fall
because the Fed is very concerned that market gains have led
consumers to increase spending unsustainably and overheat the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some investors are worried that companies are
pumping up their earnings by taking some profits on successful
venture capital investments. Intel, Microsoft and other technology
companies recorded big profits from such investments in the fourth
quarter, as did Chase Manhattan and some other non-technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Applegate of Lehman played down that concern. Other
strategies that companies have used to bolster earnings, like
lumping many expenses into one-time charges, have largely
disappeared over the last couple of years after regulators clamped
down, he said.

A DANGEROUSLY WEAK RUSSIA

<P>
   There was a stirring of anxiety in the West when Russia
published its new national security concept earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   A previous national security concept, published in 1997, had
stipulated that nuclear arms were to be used only when the
existence of the nation was at stake. The new doctrine allows
Russia ``the use of all forces and equipment at its disposal,
including nuclear weapons, if it has to repel armed aggression if
all other means of resolving the crisis have been exhausted or
proved ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   Any such lowering of the barrier to the use of nuclear weapons
is bad news for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The new doctrine prepared by the Kremlin's National Security
Council illustrates a paradoxical insight long familiar to policy
makers: In the near term, the United States and its allies may have
more to fear from Russian weakness than from Russian strength.
</P>
<P>
   The new nuclear threshold is being asserted to compensate for
the decomposition of Russia's conventional armed forces. Contrary
to the triumphalism of media outlets in thrall to the Kremlin,
Russia's military performance in the current offensive against
Chechnya reveals low morale in a conscript army, unreliable and
poorly maintained equipment, tactical clumsiness, and troubled
relations between generals and their civilian superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit logic of Russia's new security concept is that, as
demonstrated by the second hapless war against Chechnya, Russia is
not now capable of repelling a foreign enemy such as NATO or China
except through nuclear deterrence. It was for the same reason that
during the Cold War years, NATO's strategic doctrine refused to
rule out a first use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Moscow's new security concept is its
recognition that the main threat to Russia's national interests
comes from economic weakness, crime, and corruption. The antidotes
commended include ``maintaining constitutional order, deepening
democracy, and rooting out extremism.'' The more Russia succeeds at
these tasks, the less anxiety it will cause in the West.

THE SECRET OF LUBAVITCH SUCCESS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg would never be mistaken for a
member of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement or a follower of the late
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the movement's hugely admired _
and greatly controversial _ leader, who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met the rebbe,'' said Rabbi Hertzberg, using the term
for ``teacher'' that Hasidic groups give to their spiritual leaders
and that was universally applied to Schneerson. Hertzberg, a former
president of the American Jewish Congress, for many years the
leader of a Conservative Jewish congregation and the author of
books on Judaism and Jewish history, said, ``I always thought, what
have I, a notorious liberal _ on the matter of Israel a dove _ to
say to the rebbe, who was a notorious hawk?''
</P>
<P>
   But here was Hertzberg declaring that the Lubavitch movement
``has made an enormous change in the Jewish world,'' one that left
him, he said, ``absolutely staggered with admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Lubavitch is known for its curbside urging of
Jews to increase their level of religious observance, whether by
ritual actions or kind deeds. Today Chabad, as the movement is also
known, operates centers or mounts programs in large cities and
remote towns in 100 countries. Nearly a million Jewish children _
almost all of them not Lubavitchers _ attend its schools, camps and
educational programs. At a time when a group of prominent Israeli
rabbis have banned the Internet as morally perilous for their
followers, Chabad has created 700 Web sites in more than 50
countries, again intended to serve not its own members but Jews in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg said Lubavitch had given Orthodox Judaism an altered,
open face to the world. If almost all the branches of Judaism and
even some of the Orthodox groups in Israel ``have got into
outreach,'' he said, Lubavitch is the reason _ ``they are the ones
who in a sense have shamed all the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was provoked by an anniversary. Last Monday the
Lubavitch group marked the 50th anniversary (according to the
Jewish calendar) of the death of the sixth rebbe, Rabbi Yosef
Yitzchak Schneerson, and the succession of his son-in-law, Rabbi
Menachem Schneerson, the seventh and last rebbe in a line going
back to the group's founding in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of people like Hertzberg is significant because
anyone trying to understand the achievement of Chabad confronts a
serious obstacle: the enormous reverence surrounding the rebbe.
Such attachment inevitably puts the outsider on guard against the
claims made on behalf of himself or his movement.
</P>
<P>
   That reverence, of course, was not limited to the rebbe's
Hasidic followers. Jews from all around the world _ both rich and
poor, pious and doubting, powerful statesmen and humble housewives
_ streamed to encounter him at his headquarters in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn. Critics saw all this as pure adulation and accused the
rebbe of fostering, or at least tolerating, a cult of personality
that, in turn, was leveraged into political power in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth rebbe had interpreted Bolshevik persecution in Russia,
where the Lubavitchers were originally, followed by the Holocaust
as signs that redemption by the Messiah was at hand. His
son-in-law, the seventh rebbe, had read the unforeseen security and
opportunity of exile in America as another mysterious sign of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s many Lubavitchers, seeing that the rebbe had no son
or designated successor, took those messianic expectations a step
further and concluded that the rebbe himself was the Messiah. The
fervor quickly spun into what mainstream Judaism and Lubavitch
leaders judged dangerous or heretical excesses, dividing the
movement and threatening to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Today the storm has calmed, and the question is no longer can
Lubavitch survive, but why Lubavitch has been so influential. Its
numbers are smaller than those of other Hasidic groups. There are
no official figures; estimates run from well below 100,000 to up to
200,000. It has remained uncompromising in adherence to views that
would be generally termed fundamentalist. Nonetheless, its
activities, costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, are
largely supported by non-Lubavitch Jews, some of them not even
observant.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this success, organizationally, has been the concept
of ``schlicum,'' or emissaries, who are sent by the movement to a
community in need and make a lifetimes commitment to serve and
raise their families there. From their earliest years, Lubavitch
young people see such a daunting commitment as the highest form of
messianic undertaking. They are carefully selected for their
assignments, but they are also expected to be self-supporting in
their activities, recruiting assistance and raising funds locally.
In this sense, Chabad is a movement that is both highly centralized
and strongly decentralized.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 3,700 emissary families around the world. They
combine a kind of religious entrepreneurship, whose programs employ
almost 50,000 other professionals, with a very personal ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had a prominent impact on a great many Jews,
especially in places without a large Jewish infrastructure as well
as places remote from centers of Jewish life,'' said another
scholar, not at all associated with Lubavitch, Jack Wertheimer, a
professor of Jewish history and the provost at Jewish Theological
Seminary. ``They have often provided basic services, from education
to kosher food, where they were lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said there was both ``a very loving, caring face to
Lubavitch'' and a more aggressive, militant one, ``a kind of
conquering mentality.'' Congregational rabbis, he noted, have
sometimes felt that Lubavitch presented an unfair competition,
targeting particular age groups for programs or mounting colorful,
publicity-gathering events for certain holy days, while the rabbis
had to provide a wide array of year-round services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``competition can be healthy and serve as a spur,'' he
added, and other Jewish movements have been trying to meet the
standard of ``personal and caring presence'' that Lubavitch has
set.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all this there is of course a theology, a spiritual
vision _ of the rebbe himself and of the Chabad Hasidic tradition
from its beginning. It is a vision that stresses how all creation
is suffused with a divine essence; consequently, modern
communications technology is to be embraced and put to good
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginning, Lubavitch teaching also had a strong
anti-elitist, outward impulse expressed in the writings of its
founder, Rabbi Schneur Zalman, who wanted to make even the mystical
dimension of Jewish observance accessible to the average Jews.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things that Lubavitchers like to point to rather
than the mundane organizational details, and probably they are
right. Nonetheless, the teaching remains most powerfully expressed
in the way it is lived out _ in this case by thousands of people
willing to make lifetime commitments to serve Jews not of their
movement, and often in obscure and isolated places.

GEOFFREY E. PERRY DIES AT 72; MONITORED SOVIET SATELLITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoffrey E. Perry, a British grammar school teacher who used
rudimentary equipment to uncover secret details of the Soviet space
program during the Cold War and later became a trusted consultant
to United States government agencies, died on Tuesday near his home
in Bude, Cornwall. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a sudden heart attack, said Max White, a close
friend.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kettering Grammar School in England, Perry and boys he
had trained to interpret satellite signals from a simple radio
receiver caused an international stir in 1966, when he announced
that the Soviet Union had begun using a third launching site, at
Plesetsk in northwest Russia, whose existence was then secret.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur monitoring program, which eventually outgrew the
school and is now an international collaboration called the
Kettering Group, went on to become one of the best sources of
public information on Soviet satellites as they malfunctioned, fell
out of the sky or simply went about their routine business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did amazing things with very little equipment,'' said
Marcia Smith, a space policy analyst with the Congressional
Research Service, which called upon Perry as a consultant for its
reports on the Soviet space program. ``The most important pieces of
equipment he had were his brain and his desire to share information
with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey E. Perry was born on Aug. 4, 1927, in Braintree, Essex,
and received a bachelor's degree from Reading University, where he
studied physics. He began teaching at Kettering in the early '50s.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in space was first stirred by a German V-2 rocket
that landed near his home in Braintree during World War II. His
interest was further piqued by a multinational scientific program,
the International Geophysical Year in 1957, which involved much
discussion of conditions in space.
</P>
<P>
   Perry later said his reading on that program left him ``mentally
prepared'' for the Soviet launching of Sputnik in October 1957. By
the early '60s, he was monitoring the radio transmissions of
telemetry data from Soviet satellites with amateur radio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Perry's method, said Dr. Jonathan McDowell, an
astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who
also publishes Jonathan's Space Report, revolved around a
phenomenon called the Doppler effect. Familiar in causing the
rising and falling tones of train whistles as they approach and
recede, the phenomenon has a similar effect on radio emissions from
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ordinary signal doesn't do that,'' McDowell said. ``So if
you see one of these things Dopplering in and out, it's pretty
clear that you've got a satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree and timing of the rise and fall allowed Perry to
deduce things like changes in satellites' altitudes and other
characteristics, McDowell said. Perry eventually learned to use
other information, like data on the orbits published by American
agencies and the coded information the telemetry signals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Perry began ``assigning'' individual satellites to boys at
the school, White said. A principal qualification for the work was
a willingness to have dinner at school, White said. It was during
those hours that the Soviet satellites would generally pass over
the Soviet Union and transmit data to control stations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Perry noticed that Soviet satellites were in a
different orbit than usual and were communicating to a new place on
the ground. He concluded that the Soviets had begun using a new
launching site. After a researcher at the Congressional Research
Service read his obscure report on the new site in a trade
publication and alerted reporters, ``the world's media descended on
Kettering Grammar School,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after a student pointed out irregularities in the
motions of a satellite he had been assigned, Perry predicted the
crash of a Soviet nuclear-powered satellite. It plummeted to the
ground in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering Group continued to be one of the world's most
reliable sources of public information after it left the school on
Perry's retirement in 1984. It is now a worldwide confederation of
amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is survived by his wife, Jean, and by his daughter, Isabel
Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
   The recent opening of previously secret Soviet archives,
McDowell said, revealed the accuracy of much of Perry's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like the archetypal English amateur expert,'' McDowell
said. ``But at the same time the quality of what he did was better
than the professionals'. ''

GEORGE C. CROWLEY, 80, INVENTOR OF CONTROLLED ELECTRIC BLANKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George C. Crowley, an engineer and inventor whose work led to 80
patents, including one for the first thermostatically controlled
electric blanket, died Jan. 15 in Pinehurst, N.C., after suffering
from pneumonia. He was 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation in 1942 from the University of Notre Dame,
where he was a third-string quarterback, Crowley joined the Navy
and was assigned to the General Electric Co., which was engaged in
numerous wartime technical projects. It was Crowley's development
work on electrically heated flying suits that would enable pilots
to fly above antiaircraft fire that led to his invention of the
electric blanket, which was patented by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley's later work for G.E. and for the Northern Electric Co.
brought dozens more patents for other products as well as
refinements for blankets. He continued to invent after retiring
from Northern Electric in 1982 as executive vice president for
research and engineering. When he died, he had a patent pending for
a control that would automatically switch off an overheating
blanket; he had hoped to provide the device to Japanese
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 6 years old, Crowley was exhibiting his flair
for invention, wiring the stairs to his third-floor room to warn of
approaching parents, said David Scott, a son-in-law. By 12 he had
rigged a dining room door to open so that his mother could easily
pass through carrying armloads of dishes and had the curtains close
when someone flipped on the lights. Sometimes he would induce
family members to survey the kitchen ``looking for things he could
invent,'' Scott added.
</P>
<P>
   For his work in developing a negative temperature coefficient
electrical cable, a major improvement in blanket technology, G.E.
presented him in 1949 with its Charles A. Coffin Award, the
company's highest honor for an employee.
</P>
<P>
   The citation spoke of his ``outstanding ingenuity and technical
judgment in the design and development of a control circuit which
made possible considerable advances'' in blanket quality.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, who was born in Keansburg, N.J., also turned his
inventiveness to golf. In 1958, he and a partner, Robert J. Sertl,
patented a device for painting balls that used a blower to suspend
them in the air while they were sprayed and dried. Other inventions
were a tennis-ball bouncer and a device to chase squirrels from
bird feeders, the latter abandoned ``when he began to feel bad for
the squirrels'' that received a one-volt shock, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the patents belonged to his employers, and he
never reaped substantial financial benefits. When people would
inquire, the genial Crowley would explain that ``after all, these
companies paid my salary,'' which he considered sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as board chairman of St. Joseph of the Pines
Hospital in Southern Pines, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley is survived by his second wife, the former Barbara
Talley, whom he married in 1982, and his four daughters: Ginger
Scott of Hobe Sound, Fla; Susan Brewster of Key Biscayne, Fla.;
Karen Klein of Cary, N.C.; and Elizabeth Nielsen of Avon Lake,
Ohio; two stepdaughters, eight grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren. His marriage to Virginia Kozlowicz ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently called as an expert witness in lawsuits involving
fires said to have been caused by faulty electric blankets _ the
real cause was often cigarettes _ Crowley never doubted the
blankets' safety and used them regularly himself. ``He loved
them,'' his wife said. ``We have one on our king-size bed right
now.''

Karolyi only one for this challenge
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a flip but a flop.
</P>
<P>
   From the giddy high of reaching the Olympic mountaintop in
Atlanta, dramatically touching billions and establishing itself as
the world's next power with the team gold medal, USA Gymnastics bit
landing mats. Often, literally. What should have been the start of
something big in a sport U.S. Olympic fans have come to embrace
more than any other, became a dramatic harbinger of bad times.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Games of Sydney are but eight months away and if the
field of medal contenders were handicapped, the U.S. women's team
would be considered an also-ran. The luster is gone. The presumed
up-and-comers didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of 1996, as the likes of Shannon Miller, Kerri Strug
and Amanda Borden moved on to college, marriage or both in Miller's
case, Team USA experienced a slow decline in international results.
Finally last October, the big crash hit as the U.S. women showed
little individual fire and finished a dismal sixth as a team,
trailing even Australia, whose Olympic history in the sport could
be chronicled on a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   The question USA Gymnastics had to ask itself was, why? Instead
of riding the wave of hope built in 1996, USA Gymnastics sank
quickly and could only wonder how such a thing could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the organization realized what was missing: Bela
Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gymnastics coach in history retired for the second
time after the 1996 Games. This time, he really meant it, or so he
believed. After retiring in 1992, few who followed the sport
figured it would be permanent. And it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely my thought and my desire was not to come back,''
Karolyi said. ``I thought the national team was in good hands, with
Steve Nunno, Mary Lee Tracy, Kelli Hill. There were so many young
coaches who were ready, and I thought they would go very far.''
</P>
<P>
   But in December, as the 2000 Games fast approached and there was
no direction apparent, USA Gymnastics asked Karolyi to serve as
coordinator of the national team.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Karolyi conducted his first national team camp at his
gym here, putting some 27 Olympic hopefuls through a series of
tests, drills and rigorous technical training. It was classic
Karolyi. He pushed the athletes hard, watched every move, dissected
every trick and consulted with coaches on how the athletes could
improve before the Olympic Trials in August. What he saw in the
Olympic hopefuls this week, Karolyi didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical part isn't there yet,'' Karolyi said. ``I'm not
dreaming of an overnight miracle. I know there's going to be a long
and rocky road until the end. The coaches haven't done anything
majorly wrong or less effective. They're great coaches. But
overall, there has been something missing. The unity of the team
and building the desire hasn't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Olympic hopes seemed distant two months ago, that no
longer is the case. Karolyi consults daily with coaches, and the
grueling camps will continue every month through July.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a handful of very good athletes,'' Karolyi said.
``The perception might be that it will be impossible to win a
medal, but that's because these young ones haven't been very
visible. If I thought we wouldn't get there, I wouldn't be
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the young stars who stood out this week, Vanessa Atler,
Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney caught Karolyi's eye. He also watched
the progress of 1996 Olympic veterans Jaycie Phelps, Amy Chow and
Dominique Moceanu, all of whom are making comebacks as the
deficiency in proven talent is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, who has grown nearly a foot since '96 and left the
sport temporarily when she sued her parents for legal emancipation
in 1998, might have the toughest road, but the greatest upside.
Tall and elegant, Moceanu must redefine her style to more closely
resemble the engaging presentation Belarus' Svetlana Boguinskaia
made in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to recognize the little pixie anymore,'' Karolyi
said of Moceanu. ``Is she going to be capable? I can't predict it,
but the willingness and desire is obvious. All three of those '96
athletes definitely need to work. There is no red carpet rolled out
for any of them. We cannot afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Not with only eight months until the greatest moment in
U.S. gymnastics history could turn into one of its greatest
disappointments, unless Karolyi again can work his magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very intense mental and physical
preparation,'' Karolyi said. ``The coaches are going to coach, and
I'm going to try and help where I can. We have a long way to go and
not a lot of time to get there. But I know one thing. What kind of
medal we're going to come back with I'm not sure, but we will be a
medal contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Bela. USA Gymnastics needs you now more than ever.
