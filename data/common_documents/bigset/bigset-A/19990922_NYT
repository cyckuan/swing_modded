SCOOP ON AN OWNER'S DEAL RAISES ISSUE OF FAVORITISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The featured article in the first issue of The Daily Deal,
American Lawyer Media Inc.'s new journal for the world of mergers
and acquisitions, broke the news that Voicestream Wireless Corp.
was ``in the midst of negotiating a new acquisition.'' It added
that ``Analysts agree that Aerial Communications is the likeliest
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   What the piece did not say was that American Lawyer Media is
owned by Bruce Wasserstein's investment banking firm, Wasserstein
Perella &AMP; Co., and that the investment banker for a group of
Aerial's independent directors was the same Wasserstein Perella &AMP;
Co. The bankers advising Voicestream were Goldman, Sachs and those
for Aerial's management were Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The issues involved in news organizations' covering their
corporate bosses or corporate cousins are hardly new since the rise
of media giants like Time Warner Inc., with its stable of news
magazines, and Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC News. But the
VoiceStream-Aerial article raised a slightly different issue: What
happens when a corporate boss is in a position to leak information
about an upcoming deal to its news subsidiary?
</P>
<P>
   Both Wasserstein and Robert Teitelman, the editor in chief of
The Daily Deal, strenuously deny that happened in this case, which
was mentioned Tuesday in The Financial Times. And it was unclear if
Wasserstein knew either about the news article or the merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has any reason to worry. Never did, never has, never
will,'' Wasserstein said Tuesday, pointing out that the firm's
American Lawyer Media had plenty of other publications, and that
this issue has not been raised in those cases. Wasserstein Perella
has owned American Lawyer Media for two years through its
subsidiary, U.S. Equity Partners LP.
</P>
<P>
   One banker, who spoke on condition that he not be named, said it
would be foolish to risk the trust of a company's banking clients,
or otherwise hurt its business, for the sake of a few scoops in a
newspaper subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelman said in an interview, ``I know who the source is and
it was not from Wasserstein.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside observers, like the securities law professor Alan
Bromberg of Southern Methodist University, were troubled by the
overlapping interests involved. ``One tends to wonder, since he was
involved in the publication, was favoritism exercised?'' Bromberg
said. ``Confidentiality is always important in negotiating a
deal.'' Leaks, he said, can affect ``not only if you'll make the
deal but when you'll make the deal and at what price you'll make a
deal. There are a lot of examples where leaks killed a deal because
the market began to run up and that priced the deal out of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelman said that the issue had not occurred to him in the
helter-skelter rush to publication of his newspaper. Nor, he said,
would it have made much difference. ``You create your Chinese
walls. You say you have your Chinese walls. The only thing that
matters at the end of the day is what you do.''

VENEZUELAN LEADER PLEDGES PAYMENT OF ALL DEBTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Also filed in ``i'' category)  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to reassure foreign investors,
Venezuela's president said Tuesday that his government would make
all its debt payments while at the same time work on a
market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current
debt over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to service our foreign debt, but we want to
reduce the profile,'' President Hugo Chavez said through a
translator at a New York news conference, held in part to give him
a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging
markets in Latin America. Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default
on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from
the devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's news conference was organized by J.P. Morgan
Securities, which is offering the government ideas on ways to
rework its debt. As the session began, Susana de la Puente,
managing director for Latin American investment banking at J.P.
Morgan Securities, noted that there had been ``a lot of bad press
about Venezuela lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chavez nor his finance minister, Jose Rojas, would give
any details of what kind of debt reworking they were thinking of.
But Ms. de la Puente said that if any proposal was made to revamp
Venezuela's $21.1 billion in foreign debt, it would be ``market
driven,'' adding that there would be no ``involuntary
restructuring.'' She said it was possible to approach investors
with a deal allowing Venezuela to swap current debt for new bonds.
``We are waiting for the right opportunity, a good opportunity to
do it,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern about the political and economic future of
Venezuela has left its debt prices at levels just above those for
Ecuador and Russia. The Russians have effectively defaulted, and
Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that
would avoid a Brady bond default. Brady bonds, which are named for
Nicholas F. Brady, a former treasury secretary, were designed as a
way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to
many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in
the early 1980s. The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more
attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and
came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $96 million in interest
and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday, right
in the middle of the International Monetary Fund's semiannual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current
Brady bonds, although there have been reports that future oil
revenue may be used as collateral. Emerging-market analysts do not
think debt restructuring will be easy for Ecuador. And some say it
will not be able to meet the requirements of an IMF economic
program, which is a prerequisite for more international aid.

COWBOYS COACH HAS POSITIVE FEELINGS ON BYE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey has no worries about the upcoming
bye week possibly serving as a momentum-killer to the Cowboys' 2-0
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you lose momentum by having an off-week,'' the
Cowboys' coach said yesterday. ``I think you lose momentum by
losing games.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the Cowboys' next game Oct. 3 against Arizona,
this much is known:
</P>
<P>
   For the month of September, only the NFL schedule maker will be
able to lay claim to having stopped the Cowboys, who sit alone atop
the NFC East and share the NFC's best record with Detroit, also
2-0. St. Louis is 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me, it's all positive,'' said Gailey, pointing to
injuries _ both old and new _ that will be helped by getting the
extra week to heal. ``There's no better time than now to have a
break ... whatever the reason, pick one. That's my story and I'm
sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are coming off a 24-7 Monday Night Football victory
over Atlanta. By the Arizona game 11 days from now, cornerbacks
Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith could be back, along with rookie
backup tight end Mike Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey expects Smith, who had a bulging disk diagnosed in his
back during training camp and received a series of three injections
to control the inflammation, to be back practicing with the team
``if not this week then next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Smith, who hasn't been on the field since the Hall
of Fame exhibition game Aug. 9 in Canton, Ohio, is ``closer to one
week than six weeks'' in being ready to play again. Gailey would
not comment specifically when asked about Smith's chances of
playing against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   There are two new injuries along the offensive line that need
mending time. If there was a game this week, said Gailey, right
tackle Erik Williams (strained quadriceps) and right guard Everett
McIver (strained hamstring) would be listed as ``doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no game this week, which is another reason for the
Cowboys to welcome the bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everett is a little more doubtful than Erik right now,''
Gailey said. Replacements Tony Hutson and Ben Fricke did a suitable
job of filling in ``but weren't as crisp as the first group, and
they shouldn't be because they don't take as many reps,'' Gailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson, who can play either guard or tackle, played the whole
game in Williams' place at right tackle. Gailey described Williams'
injury as ``a bizarre thing.'' He experienced pain simply jogging
onto the field after pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Fricke, a first-year free agent who was out of football when the
Cowboys called him early in camp during a rash of injuries to
offensive linemen, came in at the two-minute warning of the first
half and finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey has seen from the Cowboys after two games into his
second season can be measured more in heart than in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we're capable of winning through adversity,''
Gailey said of the Cowboys' 41-35 overtime victory at Washington
and the 24-7 win over Atlanta. ``The first week, we overcame \Ra
21-point deficit\S and a \R504 yards allowed\S performance that was
not up to the standards of our defense. This week, we overcame
injuries to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can fight through adversity, and I think that
will help us win down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was especially impressed with the stoicism shown by
receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, who was forced to leave the game
late in the first quarter when he landed hard on the same left
shoulder that he slightly separated in early August. Ismail
returned to play the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful \Rfor Ismail\S, but there was no structural
damage,'' said Gailey. ``He came back and went to war for us. I was
very impressed in what he did for our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there isn't much Gailey will object to these days,
not even an idle week on the schedule when his team is hot.

PACIFIC-10 CAPSULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A closer look at the Pac-10 schools (apart from
USC and UCLA): &QL; 
ARIZONA WILDCATS &QL; 
__ Record: 2-2, 0-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? A long time ago, they were supposed to be.
After losses to Penn State and Stanford, and a narrow win over TCU,
however, the Wildcats are no longer feared by the rest of the
conference. They might be lucky to go to the Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Linebacker DaShon Polk of Taft leads what
was supposedly a dominating defense _ except against Penn State,
TCU and Stanford. Wide receiver Dennis Northcutt is the Wildcats'
best big-game performer. Running back Trung Canidate takes pressure
off the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Maybe the only team in the nation that wanted a
two-quarterback system. Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins seem to
complement each other wonderfully, but Jenkins has begun to assert
himself.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Dick Tomey went 12-1 last season and secured
his job for some time, but in a Tomey tradition, the Wildcats are
bombing when there are high preseason expectations.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: The Wildcats can confuse teams with the 1-2
punch of Smith and Jenkins, and their home-field advantage usually
wins games by itself. Usually.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: Arizona's biggest weakness is the absence
of Chris McAlister, who singlehandedly kept one side of the field
off-limits to opposing offenses. The defense is extremely suspect,
forcing the offense to carry the burden.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: The Wildcats host USC on Oct. 9. They are
expected to win, so if they lose, the season is over. Oh wait, the
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: Arizona wanted to compete for national title. Now
they won't even get a Pac-10 title. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARIZONA STATE SUN DEVILS &QL; 
__ Record: 1-1, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? After a disastrous 5-6 season, the Sun Devils
could be the dark horse to win the Pac-10 title, as long as they
don't play New Mexico State anymore.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Quarterback Ryan Kealy must return from
minor knee surgery or the Sun Devils will be finished. Tailback
J.R. Redmond is a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate. Cornerback
Courtney Jackson has been a mainstay for three years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Snyder is coming off a losing season but has
plenty of goodwill left from the '96 Rose Bowl season. He'll be
here as long as he wants.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: The Sun Devils' offense is nicely balanced
with Kealy's passing and Redmond's running. The defense, peppered
with JC transfers, is better despite the New Mexico State
performance.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: Kealy needs to recover from his
season-opening knee injury. The defense has holes and has to put
more pressure on quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Oct. 2 against UCLA. The Sun Devils believe
they are a better team, but to avert last season's early collapse
and build confidence, they need a quality victory.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: With everyone obsessed over Arizona, UCLA and
USC, the Sun Devils can quietly go about their business and contend
for conference title, provided the New Mexico State game was a
fluke. &QL; 
CALIFORNIA &QL; 
__ Record: 1-1, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? They could be, although history suggests
otherwise. The Golden Bears have one of the best defenses in the
conference, so if the offense is merely adequate, a bowl trip is
conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Linebacker Sekou Sanyika is ready for a
breakout season. His position-mate, Matt Beck, is just as good.
Defensive linemen Jerry DeLoach and Andre Carter are among the
conference's best.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Sophomore Samuel Clemons is filling time until
freshman Kyle Boller is ready to start.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Tom Holmoe dumped offensive coordinator Doug
Cosbie and offensive line coach Monte Clark last year and is not
popular in Berkeley. A big recruiting year bought some time, but
the Bears need to start winning.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: Defense. Defense. Defense. The offense will
sputter, but if Holmoe has the guts to play CB Deltha O'Neal 20-25
plays on offense, the Bears could cause problems. Already, 12 of
Cal's 19 freshmen have played.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: Clemons proves inept and Boller has to play
too much too soon. The defense suffers any injuries at linebacker
or along the line.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Saturday against Arizona State. The Bears are
reeling from their loss to Nebraska and got a week off to recover.
But things could go downhill fast if they don't beat ASU in
Strawberry Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: If Boller survived the Nebraska experience, Cal
could pull off a six-win season. &QL; 
OREGON &QL; 
__ Record: 2-1, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? Perhaps. The Ducks no longer have Akili Smith,
but A.J. Feeley has been impressive in three starts. The key will
be whether tailback Reuben Droughns can regain form after suffering
a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Besides Droughns, wide receiver Tony
Hartley is always dangerous. But you win with defense, and
linebacker Peter Sirmon and cornerback Brandon McLemore are going
to have to have career seasons.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Feeley has locked up the job, after beating out
sophomore Joey Harrington in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Mike Bellotti just signed a long-term
contract, and has made people forget they cared when Rich Brooks
left for the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: Feeley should have the passing game going
full speed now. The defense has more talent than people think.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: The Ducks can be overpowered by physical
teams, as Michigan State demonstrated, and the running game
sputters when Droughns isn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Oct. 2 at Washington. The Ducks dislike no team
more in the conference, and Bellotti can't stand new Huskies coach
Rick Neuheisel. Should be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: The Ducks will take their lumps in the conference
but should be able to squeeze a trip to the Aloha Bowl out of this
season. &QL; 
OREGON STATE &QL; 
__ Record: 3-0, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? No, but they might not be bad. The Beavers
have a new coach (Dennis Erickson) and are more confident than ever
after Mike Riley turned the program around.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Quarterback Jonathan Smith leads the
Pac-10 in passing amd tailback Ken Simonton is averaging 188.5
yards per game. Linebacker Jonathan Jackson anchors a defense that
is trying to replace six starters.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Smith is the man, especially with senior Terrance
Bryant suspended at the outset of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Erickson is being treated like a king. He has
so much authority that he canceled plans to install grass and will
keep AstroTurf at Parker Stadium, which he thinks will suit a
pass-happy offense.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: By scheduling bad teams. Oregon State has
the Pac-10's longest winning streak (four games), partly by playing
the likes of Nevada, Fresno State and Georgia Southern in the
pre-league games.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: By playing Pac-10 teams. The Beavers are
actually not pushovers anymore, but neither Smith nor Simonton can
have an off day, because the defense can't shut anyone down.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Oct. 16 at Stanford. The Beavers hunger for a
winning season and this is one of those games that makes a
difference. A win makes a bowl a real possibility and a loss means
Oregon State needs to pull a major upset somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: If the Beavers can shake off the adjustment of
having their third coach in four years, they will likely pull off a
winning season. &QL; 
STANFORD &QL; 
__ Record: 2-1, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? Who knows? The Cardinal has been reeling for
two years and its morale wasn't helped by the 69-17 shellacking
Texas gave it. But wins over Washington State and Arizona forced a
total re-evaluation of its potential.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Remember when Todd Husak was viewed as a
stopgap measure? Now he's indispensable. Flanker Troy Walters is
the most underappreciated player in the Pac-10. Freshman running
back Kerry Carter from Canada is already a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Husak is starting, with Camarillo's Joe Borchard
the backup. How many recruiting analysts goofed by calling Randy
Fasani one of the nation's best backs in '96?
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: The alumni were foaming at the mouth to
replace Tyrone Willingham, but athletic director Ted Leland has
brushed off any notion for a coaching change and the heat is off
right now. Willingham is 17-17 vs. the Pac-10 _ and half of those
wins have come against Cal and Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: Stanford needs to outscore teams, with
Walters and Collins providing the points. And the defense can't
allow 69 points a game again. Right?
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: Many different ways. The defense can be
porous, as Texas showed, and Husak can be inconsistent. The overall
sick feeling surrounding the program would also be worth a couple
of losses, unless the Arizona game cured that problem.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Saturday against UCLA. OK, the Cardinal routed
Arizona and pummeled Washington State. Now it's time to see if this
season will be different. Don't bet any money on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: The good news is Stanford is in first place in
the Pac-10. The bad news is seven teams haven't started conference
play. &QL; 
WASHINGTON &QL; 
__ Record: 0-2, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? The Huskies have too much talent to go through
too much pain in Rick Neuheisel's first year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Linebacker Lester Towns might be the
Pac-10's best. Defensive ends Jabari Issa and Mac Tuiaea won't back
down from anyone, and quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo is emerging as
a bonafide star.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: No more Huards left for Huskies fans to boo?
That's good news for Neuheisel, because Tuiasosopo will cause more
headaches than any other quarterback, with his ability to scramble
and throw on the run.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Neuheisel is the highest-paid coach in the
conference (about $1 million per season), and he'll have at least a
two-year grace period while he rebuilds from what Jim Lambright
left.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: The defensive line is strong, and Towns is
an eraser at linebacker. The offense keeps opponents off-balance as
long as Tuiasosopo is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: The secondary is full of holes, as Brigham
Young proved, and the running game is inconsistent with sophomore
Willie Hurst and freshman Paul Arnold at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Oct. 16 against Arizona State. The Huskies
could still have delusions about making a run in the conference. If
they're serious, they need to derail the Sun Devils in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: If Neuheisel keeps Huskies off probation, let's
pencil this in as a six-win season. &QL; 
WASHINGTON STATE &QL; 
__ Record: 0-3, 0-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Are they good? Next question.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players who matter: Tailback Kevin Brown, before being kicked
off team for burglary and transferring to UNLV, and cornerback
Chris Martin, who was declared academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB status: Senior Steve Birnbaum has started the first three
games with limited success, and freshman Jason Gesser continues to
push his way into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach's status: Mike Price might not survive this season, but
hey, this is Washington State. He took them to the Rose Bowl two
years ago, so it's his job for life.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll win: A major snowstorm will blow through Pullman
for every home game, rendering opponents helpless.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they'll lose: There's too many reasons to list here, but
it doesn't help that 17 players the Cougars figured would be on
this year's roster are not, mostly for academic or
off-field-behavior reasons.
</P>
<P>
   __ The key game: Oct. 9 against SW Louisiana. Hey, you take a
win wherever you can get it around the Palouse these days.
</P>
<P>
   __ End result: A long time ago, in a season far, far away, the
Cougars went to the Rose Bowl. They might call the Chargers about
taking Ryan Leaf back.

   News usually travels quickly in baseball. If somebody's
assistant general manager is interviewed for someone else's general
manager's job, the word goes hurtling through the game's unofficial
network of officials and scouts. If a young phenom is suddenly
found to have trouble hitting breaking balls, he might as well head
for the minors yesterday because the scouts record it in their
notebooks and instantly spread the word on the network.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets must have had their connection to the network wired
into the telephone switching station in Rochelle Park, N.J., that
was flooded out by Hurricane Floyd because they apparently never
got the word: Chipper Jones is hitting home runs right-handed these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hit a home run left-handed against right-handed Rick Reed
in the first inning last night, then hit one right-handed against
the left-handed Dennis Cook in the eighth inning. The result: the
Atlanta Braves took the first part of their six-part test against
the Mets, winning, 2-1, and doubling their division lead over the
Mets to two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are MVPs on the Mets and around the league,''
Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, had said before the game, ``but to
me, because of our situation. ...''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish the sentence, but Cox was nominating his third
baseman for National League most valuable player. Jones, he
explained, did not have Andres Galarraga and Javier Lopez hitting
behind him. Galarraga has been out all season, Lopez for the second
half. Their absence has made his job tougher, but he has been
outdoing even himself.
</P>
<P>
   A switch-hitter, Jones has been an immensely improved hitter
from the right side of the plate. Before this year, in four
seasons, Jones hit 96 home runs left-handed, 12 right-handed. Last
season only two of his 34 home runs were hit as a right-handed
batter.
</P>
<P>
   His game-winning blow Tuesday night was his 14th home run this
season as a right-handed hitter, one third of his total of 42. He
has batted three times as often left-handed as right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Cox said, ``he had a good year right-handed, but
he didn't have the power.'' He didn't have Don Baylor as his
hitting coach either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more aggressive right-handed,'' Pat Corrales, the Braves'
dugout coach, said. ``He doesn't feel for the ball. He's swinging
the same from both sides. I think Donny got that out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, a Baylor disciple since their year in St. Louis
together (1992), has no doubt that Baylor is the one responsible
for Jones' improvement. ''For me, he's the best,'' Galarraga said
of Baylor. ``One year with him and I was the batting champion. He
knows what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jones, Baylor has a new believer. Calling his transformation
a ``change in philosophy,'' Jones explained his previous
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going up there concerned with being a .300 hitter and
driving in the runs when they were out there,'' Jones said, ``not
thinking about the home run, not really trying to hit the home run.
When I got to spring training, Don Baylor didn't like that approach
too much. He said I hit third for one of the best teams in the game
and when they turned me around, I have to make them pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more swinging from the heels than in years past has
made the difference,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has helped,'' he said. ``But that's not all. It's
the mental approach. I had a little fundamental flaw in my swing
from that side and we fixed that. All of a sudden balls started
jumping off the bat a little harder and going a little farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones acknowledged that he was skeptical at first about Baylor's
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the strikeouts would go up,'' he said, ``but they're
pretty much on par with where they've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cook came in to pitch for the Mets Tuesday night, Jones had
managed only one hit in seven career at-bats against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look for a fastball you can get extension on and hopefully
you won't miss it because he's got some good breaking stuff to go
along with it,'' Jones said of Cook. ``With the count 1 and 1, he
hadn't thrown me a fastball yet. Then he threw me one I could get
extension on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones extended all the way to the left-center field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the game for us the other day hitting a home run
right-handed,'' Cox had noted earlier. Jones hit a 10th-inning home
run against left-handed Steve Kline of Montreal last Friday. His
blow against Cook broke a 1-1 tie and kept the Mets from tying the
Braves for first place. ``That first punch is important,'' Jones
said, borrowing from another sport in discussing the first of six
games the teams will play in 10 days ``It's important to establish
some momentum. But by no means are they going to give in. A lot can
happen in the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what happens between the teams in these last two
weeks, he said, ``We could see each other again in the playoffs.''

DUTCH JOURNALIST KILLED IN EAST TIMOR

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ A Dutch journalist working for the Christian
Science Monitor and The Financial Times was killed here on Tuesday,
apparently by armed men who pursued his motorbike from a rogue
checkpoint, witnesses said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Sander Thoenes, had arrived here only hours
before, hiring a motorbike to tour the city. The motorbike driver
said Thoenes had fallen when the motorbike was hit by bullets.
Reporters who visited the area Wednesday morning found his body.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, who heads the international
peacekeeping force here, told journalists Wednesday, ``It's been
quite a dangerous 24 hours. There are some signs of the militia's
being agitated by a return into Dili of previously displaced
population.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the armed men ``have attempted to step up actions as a
show that all is not yet secure,'' adding: ``I would agree with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is obviously a reaction to our presence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The general declined to confirm the killing of Thoenes. But he
did confirm another incident on Tuesday in the same eastern portion
of the city, Becora, in which a British journalist and an American
photographer were attacked by armed men.
</P>
<P>
   He said they hid, used mobile telephones to call for help and
were rescued by Australian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The motorbike driver, Florindo da Consiecao Araujo, said he and
Thoenes tried to flee when they spotted the checkpoint manned by
six men wearing dark green Indonesian military uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the journalist to hang on tight and I tried to turn
around and they started shooting, pa-pa-pa-pa, 10 or 20 times,''
the driver said. ``The bullets cruised past. He didn't say
anything. He just hung on to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The motorbike was hit and the two men fell, Araujo said. The
driver ran, pursued by some of the armed men. ``I saw the
journalist looking like he was asleep on the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters said they found Thoenes' body behind a burned-out
house, where it had apparently been dragged. A notebook and a pen
lay beside it.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
A few weeks ago, it became clear Juan Montoya was a lock to be CART
Rookie of the Year this season. By that time, Montoya also knew he
had a chance to accomplish a bigger goal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rookie of the Year would be nice,'' he said. ``But I didn't
come here for that. I came here to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Colombian comes to town this week with a chance to
clinch the 1999 FedEx championship Sunday in the Texaco/Havoline
Grand Prix of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been much more than I, or anyone on the team,
could have expected,'' said Montoya, who turned 24 Monday. ``We now
realize we have a chance to make history, so the team is committed
to earning as many points as we can in each race to see if we can
make that dream a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   With a rookie record of seven victories this season, including
three in the last four races, Montoya has a 28-point lead over
Dario Franchitti with three events remaining in the battle for the
PPG Cup.
</P>
<P>
   If Montoya leaves Houston with a 45-point advantage or more, he
will have clinched the championship and become the second rookie in
history to win the title. Nigel Mansell won the PPG Cup as a rookie
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For Montoya to clinch the championship here, he likely will need
to win the race in the No. 4 Target Honda/Reynard and have
Franchitti, the defending champion in Houston, finish 10th or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the race, I'm not going to be thinking about how many
points I need or where Dario is on the track,'' Montoya said. ``I'm
just going to concentrate on driving hard. If it ends up that I
clinch, I'll be extremely excited. I'm not expecting it, so if it
happens, it may take awhile to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it won't be easy to clinch the championship Sunday,
but Montoya is assured of leaving Houston with the points lead
regardless of what happens in the downtown street race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember at what point I actually started thinking
about winning the PPG Cup, but I try my best not to think about
it,'' he said. ``My goal from the beginning has been to score as
many points as possible each race, and that's how I'm approaching
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   If Montoya holds on to win the title, it will be the fourth
consecutive championship for the Target team of Chip Ganassi.
Italy's Alex Zanardi, whom Montoya replaced, won the crown in 1997
and 1998, and Jimmy Vasser won the championship for the team in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting time of year for us,'' Vasser said. ``Our
team knows what it's like to be in this position where so much is
riding on each race. And I've learned over the course of the season
that Juan is as tough mentally as he is physically, so he's up to
the task. He's in good position, and he knows I'm here if he's
looking for advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya hasn't needed much advice along the way, but he knows
people have wondered whether he's really this good or if he was
lucky enough to inherit the best car on the best team in CART.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through 1998, Ganassi's two-car team won 23 CART races
while all the other drivers on the circuit amassed 29 victories.
Zanardi, who left to drive in Formula One this season, won seven of
19 races last year and clinched the title with four events
remaining, the earliest of any CART champion. Vasser finished
second.
</P>
<P>
   So Montoya couldn't have asked for a better situation to begin
his CART career, and everybody knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car's a title contender,'' Michael Andretti said when
asked earlier this year if Montoya could contend for the
championship. ``That team will give him the experience to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya admits he has a talented team behind him, but he also
thinks it takes a great driver to bring the team to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip has given me a great opportunity here, and the
Honda-Firestone combination is the best,'' Montoya said. ``But I
don't think I'm out of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Nunn, the top engineer for the Target team, was the man who
persuaded Ganassi to sign the little-known Montoya after they went
to Spain last fall to watch him test a McLaren Formula One car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take any genius to know this kid was something
special,'' Nunn said. ``When I got back, I told the guys on our
team that the kid was going to win right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya has earned six of his victories in streaks. He won three
in a row early in the year at Long Beach, Calif.; Nazareth, Pa.;
and Rio de Janeiro. He won at Cleveland on June 27, then added
another three-victory streak at Lexington, Ohio; Chicago; and
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   He has put himself in position to clinch the points
championship, something he said he learned how to do last year when
he won the Formula 3000 title in Europe. Montoya felt he should
have won the Formula 3000 championship in 1997, but he was too
aggressive at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I saw a chance to win, I went for it,'' he said.
``Sometimes I shouldn't have. In 1997, I threw away points _ enough
points to win the championship _ in three or four races by making
mistakes. Last year I won the championship because I was smarter
and didn't try to win when I didn't have the best car.''
</P>
<P>
   Those early lessons seem to be paying off now and have helped
Montoya get the most out of a quality car and an experienced team.
He is closing in on his first major championship, which can be a
nerve-racking time for a young driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having too much fun to feel nervous about it,'' Montoya
said. ``No one expected me to be doing this well so soon, so I
don't feel any pressure. I'm still a rookie, so I feel like I have
nothing to lose.''

 ENCEPHALITIS DETECTED IN MOSQUITOES IN CONNECTICUT

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ State scientists said Tuesday night that they
had found the potentially deadly St. Louis encephalitis in
mosquitoes trapped at a country club here and in a crow from a back
yard in Westport. Greenwich officials immediately said they planned
to restrict outdoor activities from 5 p.m. to dawn, including youth
football and soccer practices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich's restrictions, contained in a directive that
officials expected to issue Wednesday morning, reflected the
concern that has mounted throughout the region in the three weeks
since the mosquito-borne disease was discovered in New York City.
Three people have died in the city, and nine other cases have been
confirmed. On Monday, Westchester County officials announced that
two people there had contracted the disease. A third case was
confirmed in Westchester County Tuesday in an 80-year-old Yonkers
man. County officials declined to identify the man, but said he was
in stable condition at a hospital in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Connecticut has been found to have the disease. But
Tuesday's discoveries of the virus led officials of the state
Department of Environmental Protection to prepare for widespread
aerial spraying of insecticide in Fairfield County next week. As a
first step, street-by-street spraying from trucks is to begin at
sunset Thursday in the Old Greenwich area.
</P>
<P>
   The insecticide, called Scourge, is a synthetic version of an
agent found in chrysanthemums. Officials recommended that people
stay inside, close their doors and windows, and bring children's
toys inside during the spraying. The insecticide breaks down after
about three hours of sunlight, diminishing potential exposure to
people or pets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich officials said they would ask day care services and
homes for the elderly to allow their charges outside only from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. Caroline Baisley, the town's director of health,
said the measures would remain in effect ``until we get a handle on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The order extends to golf, a leading activity here. ``When you
tee off, you're going to be told, `Be back by five,''' Dr. Baisley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich first selectman, Tom Ragland, who has the
functions of mayor, said that although the possibility of any given
person contracting the disease was remote, the ban on what he
called ``absolutely all outside activities'' was a reasonable
precaution. For instance, he said, youth sports practices would not
be allowed on town fields, where most are held. He acknowledged he
could not stop private gatherings like backyard barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this will be difficult to enforce, but it's in their
best interest,'' he said. ``How can you overreact to a disease that
is a lethal disease? They're going to be thankful that we are
minding the store.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials had a calmer tone as they announced their
findings. Dr. Theodore Andreadis, the chief medical entomologist at
the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station, in New Haven,
called the two confirmations ``a very significant finding,'' but
sought to allay public fear. ``Less than 1 percent of people who
are bitten by an infected mosquito will exhibit any disease,'' he
said. ``And of that 1 percent, only roughly 5 to 15 percent will
die. Unfortunately, the elderly are most at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus was found in a pool of adult mosquitoes collected
Sept. 14 in a trap at the Innis Arden Golf Club, on the
Greenwich-Stamford line. The crow was submitted to state officials
on Sept. 13 after it was found dead in a back yard on Riverside
Drive in Westport by a homeowner who was concerned about a rash of
dead birds. The bird died of the disease, Andreadis said. State
officials said that although the bird could not be expected to give
the disease to humans, the discovery was very troubling because
birds travel in a wide range and can pass on the disease when
bitten by mosquitoes, which then transmit it to people.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland said the most important preventive steps
people can take are to cover up when outside after sunset, and to
dump out stagnant water in clogged gutters, old tires and wading
pools. ``We don't want to alarm anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the announcement was greeted with alarm in
Greenwich. Many children walk to school in the area where the virus
was found, and several nursery schools are nearby. Paula Corrado,
58, who lives about two miles from the country club where the virus
was found, said the announcement evoked the Alfred Hitchcock film
``The Birds'' and said she expected her neighbors to react with
``controlled panic.''

WHITE: TALENT IS THERE TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Devon White won a pair of championships in Toronto
and another in Florida. He knows the talent needed to win the World
Series. And, he says, the Los Angeles Dodgers have it.
</P>
<P>
   While the front office contemplates trading a core figure of the
organization during the offseason, White said this collection of
Dodgers can win _ with some slight tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the team is patient enough to keep the team
together, but I still think this team can win if they show they're
patient,'' White said. ``I really do see that. The starting
rotation we have, the young arms we have, it's a matter of putting
it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see it now. We had guys that were not pulling the same
boat. You can't win that way. I don't look at individual stats.
It's all about winning ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who's in the first of a three-year contract with the
Dodgers, said the biggest problem was that it took the club longer
than anyone anticipated for the old Dodgers to mesh with the new
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys did things a certain way, and the guys that came in,
we're used to the way of doing whatever works,'' White said. ``It's
whatever it takes to win. That's what teams I've played with are
used to. They need to tweak the team, but what does that mean? I
don't know? People have different ideas of what tweaking means.''
</P>
<P>
   White has missed games with nagging hamstring, groin and neck
injuries, but he remains on pace for a typical season. After
hitting .279 with 22 homers and 85 RBI last season with Arizona,
White's career average stood at .262. In his last eight seasons, he
averaged 15 homers and 60 RBI in 128 games. White entered Tuesday's
game with San Francisco batting .270 with 12 homers and 61 RBI in
123 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm going out and giving my best, as long as I can
go home and look in the mirror and say I did the best, that's all
you can do,'' White said. ``If we do that, we'll be fine. That's
got to be your state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dreifort decision Thursday: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said he will decide whether to shut Dreifort down for the rest of
the season after watching the right-hander throw a bullpen session
Thursday. ``If he's struggling in the pen, that's it,'' Johnson
said. ``If you can't win, what's the sense (of chancing it). He's
thrown 180 innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's won a career-high 13 games (and lost a career-high
13) but hasn't pitched since leaving a Sept. 15 start with
tightness in his pitching shoulder. Dreifort's 1782/3 innings
pitched is four outs shy of his career best.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Eric Karros' first-inning three-run homer boosted his
total to 33 homers and 108 RBI, leaving him one homer and three RBI
shy of tying his career best in each category. . . . Left-hander
Jeff Williams became the 10th pitcher to start a game for the
Dodgers this season. Williams, from Australia, joins Eric Gagne
(Canada), Chan Ho Park (Korea), Carlos Perez and Robinson Checo
(Dominican Republic) and Ismael Valdes (Mexico) as
non-American-born pitchers to start for the club this season. . . .
Arizona claimed left-handed reliever Jeff Kubenka off waivers over
the weekend. Kubenka was designated for assignment Sept. 10. . . .
The Dodgers have fallen behind last year's pace in attendance but
should reach the 3 million mark. They went into Tuesday's game with
the Giants having drawn 2,873,589, which is 13,791 less than last
season. They had six home dates left.

FBI DIRECTOR OPPOSED CLEMENCY `UNEQUIVOCALLY,' LETTER SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI ``unequivocally opposed'' President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists,
asserting that the release of most of the prisoners would
reinvigorate their terrorist movement, according to a letter
prepared by the law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, prepared for FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, said the
clemency ``would likely return committed, experienced,
sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the clandestine movement''
for Puerto Rican independence. The letter also said the clemency
would ``psychologically and operationally enhance'' allies in the
militant organization FALN who killed five people and maimed 83 in
terrorist activities in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's letter came to light at a congressional hearing intended
by Republicans to portray the president's act as reckless. Also
Tuesday, Clinton provided his first full explanation of his
decision in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh did not sign the FBI letter, which was addressed but never
sent to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. But Freeh read it before it was forwarded to Congress,
and senior law-enforcement officials said Tuesday night that it
accurately reflected his position.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter was sent from the FBI to the Justice
Department for review prior to Freeh's signature, law enforcement
officials said. The letter was among the thousands of documents
sent by the White House to Congress in response to subpoenas for
information about the president's clemency decision.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that Freeh had objected to clemency when it was
first raised in 1994, and again as recently as June 28; even so,
the letter said, Freeh was unaware that the president was actually
contemplating any commutation when the White House announced its
offer on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have privately acknowledged disapproval of
the president's decision, Freeh's letter is the first official
indication of the fierce opposition among law enforcement officials
to the clemency offer to the 16 terrorists, most of whom have
accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself in the tradition of previous presidents who have
granted clemency in cases that were unpopular, Clinton portrayed
his release of the prisoners as an act of courage. He cited
Theodore Roosevelt's grant of amnesty to Filipino nationals who
fought U.S. control and Jimmy Carter's commutation of sentences of
Puerto Rican nationalists who had opened fire on the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exercised the power vested in them by the Constitution to
do what they believed was right, even in the face of great
controversy,'' Clinton wrote. ``I have done the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not deal with the question of whether the
release of the prisoners might reignite the dormant terrorist
movement. But Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., asserted that recent
statements by a known Puerto Rican militant and ally of the
prisoners indicated that the release was stirring old passions.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Filiberto Ojeda Rios, the leader of Los Macheteros, a
terrorist organization allied with the FALN, as telling a Puerto
Rican radio station that if the United States committed aggressive
acts against Puerto Rico, his group would ``not remain with their
arms crossed, you can be sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans coaxed out of other law enforcement officials a
concern that the ex-prisoners constituted a threat to American
security. While the officials were bound under the president's
claim of executive privilege not to disclose internal deliberations
over the matter, they catalogued the violent actions of the FALN,
the terrorist organization to which the prisoners belong.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, assistant director of national security for the
FBI, told the panel, ``These are criminals and they are terrorists
and they represent a threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has acknowledged that it has no control over clemency
matters, which are the sole prerogative of the president. But
Clinton's explanation Tuesday appeared to make little difference to
those in the hearing room, who see the move as a political disaster
for the president and for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
likely to seek the Senate seat from New York. She has run into
political trouble for at first supporting, then denouncing, her
husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have wanted to draw out the drama. The panel, led by
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the government Reform
Committee, called several victims of FALN attacks, bringing them to
testify for the third time in less than two weeks. They included
Richard Pastorella, a retired New York City detective, who was
severely injured in a 1982 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who thinks of us?'' Pastorella asked in a bitter voice.
``Certainly not Mr. Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, and relatives of those who had been killed in
terrorist attacks, said that contrary to federal requirements, they
had not been notified of the prisoners' pending release.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Republicans took issue with Clinton's apparent belief that
just because the prisoners had not been convicted of doing bodily
harm, they deserved to go free. ``The only reason some of them
didn't commit murders or bombings is because they were arrested
before they got a chance to,'' said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, both African-Americans, offered a minimal defense
of the clemency. Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill., said, ``Democracy can
be fellowship as well as punishment.'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.,
urged Congress to ``move on'' and examine issues that ``have a real
effect on the lives of average Americans.'' The committee's ranking
Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, said reluctantly that he
``probably'' would not have granted the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the president disclosed some of the arguments
that former President Carter had used in persuading Clinton to
grant clemency in this case. He said that Carter wrote to him in
1997 that releasing the prisoners would be ``a significant
humanitarian gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said that any concern that clemency might be viewed
as leniency was mitigated by the length of time that they had
already served, Clinton wrote. Most of them had been in prison at
least 16 years, a period that Clinton said was not commensurate
with the crimes of which they were convicted, which included
sedition, conspiracy and armed robbery but not bodily harm to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since he made the offer, Clinton said the
decision was difficult and that he had not minimized the concerns
of law-enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I believe equity and fairness dictated,'' the
president wrote. ``I certainly understand, however, that other
people could review the same facts I did and arrive at a different
decision.''

SUMMER OF '99 WAS MEMORABLE FOR HUMIDITY THAT WOULDN'T QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAWNA A. HAMEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This summer may not have been one of the
hottest to blanket the Kansas City area before the millennium, but
it was one of the most humid.
</P>
<P>
   With the last full day of summer upon Kansas Citians today,
things have simmered down. Area residents are enjoying brisk
mornings for the first time in months, awaiting autumn's debut at
6:31 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the summer of '99 made its presence felt. Although it won't
go into the record books for its high temperatures, it did generate
heat indexes that surged well above 100 for several periods _
including the unbearable 114 degrees reached July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a really, really humid summer with some very high
heat indexes,'' said Chad Pettera, meteorologist for Wichita-based
WeatherData Inc. ``The weather pattern of the summer never really
changed a lot _ it got real warm, and it stayed real long. And if
anything would make a summer seem hot, that would.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 19 persons in the area died this summer of heat-related
illnesses. Most of the victims were elderly people who lived alone
or those who lived in the inner city and suffered health problems
like asthma or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the month of July, there were days when the
Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust and the Kansas City Fire
Department ran heat-related calls back to back with rarely a break
in between, MAST spokesman Don Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hot every July, but there was something about this
July, because we ran a ton of calls,'' Pickard said. ``As far as we
know, it was the busiest month in the history of the system for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week from July 23 to July 30, the area suffered through
its highest temperatures, where the high readings hit 98 and stayed
at or above that level, including 103 degrees for two days at the
end of month.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, the heat took its greatest toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of days of high temperatures are fairly slow
for us,'' Pickard said, ``but once you get into the fourth or fifth
day of a heat wave _ or especially the first or second weeks _
we've got this surge in calls. Heat has a cumulative effect,
because the longer it lasts, the bigger toll it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   For at least a week, Kansas City Power &AMP; Light asked its
customers to conserve energy _ a request it rarely makes,
spokeswoman Pam Levetzow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just an incredibly important thing we asked because
this summer was so unique,'' she said. ``The heat wave had hit
every region of the country at the same time. Luckily, we didn't
have a problem, but the potential was there to put the energy
system in serious jeopardy.''

EDITORIAL: REFORMERS PARTY ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the sober nature of the upcoming presidential race
that allows the Reform Party to suddenly seem less about reform and
more about party. The dean of Reformers wears a boa to his
wrestling gig. One possible candidate wonders in print why
Americans fought Hitler, another made a name for himself building
casinos designed to rival the Taj Mahal, and then there is the
glamorous Hollywood movie star who seems oddly somber in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   If political parties like to boast of having a big tent, this
one is beginning to feel a little like a circus. Minnesota's
governor, Jesse Ventura, the party's top elected official, believes
in free trade. Pat Buchanan, a conservative Republican considering
defection, favors protectionism and extreme isolationism. Donald
Trump, Ventura's favorite, believes he is living the workingman's
fantasy and would undoubtedly campaign from his nearest penthouse
suite. Warren Beatty, a liberal who wants to talk about campaign
finance reform, has been eyeing the Reform Party as a way to
pressure his own Democratic Party. To borrow a phrase from those
younger voters the Reformers are trying so desperately to attract:
Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   To clear some of the befuddlement about the Reformers, Lawrence
Goodwyn, Duke University's expert on the populist movement in
America, offers a reminder that this party is not an invention of
the people, not an institution created by some political
groundswell over issues not being addressed by the establishment
parties. The Reform Party is a very hierarchical political machine
crafted for one purpose: the promotion of the self-anointed
presidential candidate Ross Perot. Perot appears to have talked his
way out of favor, winning almost 20 million votes in 1992 and
barely 8 million by 1996. With such a trend line, the former
presidential candidate has allegedly promised to stay in the
background, allowing others to take over the complicated process of
getting on state ballots and staging a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   With their chaperone missing, however, the Reform Party appears
to be going a little crazy. One resolution could be the crowning of
Perot's successor, whose benefits would include the kind of intense
media spotlight that seeks out this kind of wackiness. Moreover,
there is $12 million in the kitty from federal matching funds and a
chance to participate in the presidential debates. Thus, the
strange political vacuum at the top of this party is an invitation
for any candidate who wants to make plenty of noise and not a
little mischief, a conservative helping elect the Democratic
presidential candidate or a liberal helping elect the Republican.
What becomes surprising, given such power, is not that there are so
many possible applicants for the Reform Party nomination, but so
few.

 McCain demonstrates his no-nonsense approach  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Just minutes before Sen. John McCain
stepped into the packed auditorium of the Johnson County Central
Resource Library Tuesday, an aide took the senator aside.
</P>
<P>
   A little hair spray was needed, a quick comb to smooth the
Arizona Republican's solidly gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   Just another perk for a high-powered Washington insider who's
vying to be the GOP nominee for president?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. McCain, who was repeatedly tortured during his 5 years
as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, cannot raise his arms high
enough to do the job himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's time in Vietnam is one of the chief topics of his new
book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' a memoir that covers his life as the
son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals.
</P>
<P>
   His account of brutal treatment _ the Vietnamese left McCain
hanging for hours by his arms, which were broken after he ejected
from his downed jet _ is one reason the book is No. 3 on The New
York Times best-seller list. Its success brought the senator to the
Kansas City area Tuesday as part of a national book tour.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if he ever goes a day without remembering that painful
time in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' prison, McCain offered an
unexpected response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, months. Because I was able to put it behind me,'' the
63-year-old, three-term senator told interviewer Mike Shanin of
KPHN Radio.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he regularly received telephone calls, letters
or e-mails from his comrades. Then he delivered a trademark line:
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the great privilege of my life was to serve in the
company of heroes, to have the privilege to observe a thousand acts
of courage, compassion and love. Their friendship will be what I
always treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator insists he was no hero himself, even though he
turned down an opportunity to be freed early after the Vietnamese
learned that McCain's father was a top-ranked commander. Being
released before other prisoners who had served longer would have
violated the code of conduct, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his stop at the library before about 150 people, the
Republican attended a fund-raiser at the Kansas City Club in Kansas
City, Mo., and spoke to about 1,600 people Tuesday night at the
Village Presbyterian Church in Prairie Village, Kan. Vivien
Jennings of Rainy Day Books, who organized the event, said McCain
drew as many people as some other well-known authors she brings to
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the media a lot lately, and I think he's really
captured their interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McCain is riding a wave these days. His book is a big
success. He has moved into the solid double digits in polls in New
Hampshire, the nation's first primary state, although he is still
far behind the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Wolfe of La Cygne, Kan., said it would be nice to vote for
a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spits it out and tells it like it is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Reynolds of Liberty said she liked the fact that McCain
did not adhere to the GOP line and was a bit of a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a sense of honor about himself,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could catch Bush, McCain pointed to former Texas
Gov. John Connally, who in 1980 was far ahead at a similar point in
a presidential campaign and then collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early,'' McCain said. ``Governor Bush is a good
man. But I think I'm more qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   About Pat Buchanan, the Republican hopeful considering a move to
the Reform Party, McCain was blunt. He said Buchanan was not making
progress in New Hampshire where the state's booming economy is
drowning out Buchanan's protectionist message.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain suggested the Reform Party may not be a good fit for
Buchanan, who has emphasized social issues such as abortion. The
Reform Party focuses more on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Next to his book, McCain's claim to fame is his authorship of
one of the major campaign-finance bills now before Congress. McCain
and his Democratic colleague, Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin,
recently pared down the measure, but its chief target is still the
large, unregulated amounts of ``soft'' money that can be
contributed to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of money and politics, McCain is clearly
impatient, even angry, although his stand has proved unpopular with
some other senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money corrupts the legislative process,'' McCain said
earlier Tuesday on KCUR's ``Walt Bodine Show.'' ``We are now
involved in a vast influence-peddling scheme that keeps us all in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   The money-drenched political system is turning off younger
Americans in droves, McCain said. And it's discouraging Americans
of all stripes who see well-heeled interests receiving special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the tax code is 44,000 pages long, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's full of deals good for special interests,'' he said.
``It's just wrong.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Correcting the long history of racial discrimination in the New
Jersey State Police will take more than the appointment of a new
superintendent. But Gov. Christie Whitman has made a positive move
by nominating Carson Dunbar, an administrator in the FBI's New York
office, to lead the troubled department.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, who was a New Jersey trooper in the 1970s, will become
the first person of African-American ancestry to head the
2,700-member force. He faces the daunting task of changing a police
culture that has tolerated racial harassment against minority
troopers and allowed the use of racial profiling _ the illegal
practice of targeting motorists by skin color _ to flourish for
years. But the crisis will not end with Dunbar's arrival. The
Justice Department is investigating discrimination complaints and
may appoint a federal monitor to oversee the police. Numerous
lawsuits alleging bias by the agency have also been filed by
current and former troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months Whitman has ordered an overhaul of
hiring and promotion practices and appointed a monitor within the
state attorney general's office to oversee the police. But leaders
in minority communities remain skeptical. Change will depend on
whether she makes police reform a priority in her remaining years
in office _ and on whether Dunbar is strong enough to root out
those who have tolerated racist practices.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ Prior to Tuesday, Astros manager Larry Dierker had
gotten more innings out of his bullpen than he had from his
starting rotation on the current road trip, which pretty much tells
you why they lost three of the first four games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the sake of the arm-weary bullpen, the Astros were in
desperate need of a quality start Tuesday, and Scott Elarton rose
to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who has pitched with tendinitis in his right shoulder
for most of the season, threw a career-high 131 pitches and worked
6 strong innings to lead the Astros to a 6-3 victory over the
Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the Astros' first win at Three Rivers
Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   The only downer of the evening came during the eighth inning
when closer Billy Wagner felt a twinge in his left elbow. Wagner
didn't think it was anything to be alarmed about, but to be on the
safe side Dierker used veteran righthander Doug Henry to pitch the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy wanted to go back out there,'' Dierker said. ``But the
trainers didn't think he should go back, (pitching coach) Vern
(Ruhle) didn't think he should go back and I didn't think he should
go back. About the only person who thought he should go back was
Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practically had to tackle him to keep him from going out
there. I didn't see any reason to take chances. With a three-run
lead, I thought Henry could do the job. Being a pitcher and having
problems with my arm, it scares the heck out of me to think of them
feeling anything in their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry allowed two baserunners in the ninth but kept the Pirates
from scoring to earn his second save. His was one of the few fresh
arms in a bullpen that has worked far too many innings over the
past five days. That's what made Elarton's workmanlike effort so
timely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elarton really gave us everything he had,'' Dierker said. ``It
was a great effort. Our bullpen got beat up in St. Louis, and it
got beat up here last night. We didn't have many guys down there
with fresh arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (9-4) engaged in a pitchers' duel of young guns with
Pirates righthander Kris Benson, who pitched seven innings. Both
took shutouts into the seventh inning, with Benson (11-14) losing
his to a four-run outburst by the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Elarton was gone after allowing three of the
first four batters he faced to reach base in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised,'' Elarton said of his high pitch
count. ``After I had runners at first and second in the seventh
inning, I didn't have a lot left. Because of my shoulder, I don't
think I have quite the stamina I'd like to have. It really takes a
lot to get it loose in the late innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates put runners in scoring position against Elarton in
each of the first three innings but never broke through. After the
Pirates squandered their best scoring chances, Elarton retired 10
of 11 batters before running out of gas in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros were faring no better against Benson, who
retired 17 of the first 19 batters he faced, including 13 in a row.
The Astros advanced one runner into scoring position prior to their
prosperous seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benson has always been pretty good,'' said Astros left fielder
Daryle Ward, who faced Benson during his minor-league career. ``He
goes right at you with his best stuff. He's not scared to challenge
you, and that's a sign that a pitcher's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's one-out single broke a scoreless tie in the seventh, and
the Astros scored three runs on Paul Bako's two-run double and a
throwing error by Pirates first baseman Kevin Young, who was trying
to nail Bako at third after Ricky Gutierrez had grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera inherited Elarton's seventh-inning jam and pitched
admirably despite allowing two of Elarton's runners to score on
Mike Benjamin's fielder's choice grounder and a single by Brian
Giles, who is 6-for-9 with three RBIs in the first two games of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seems like Giles and (Kevin) Young are coming up every
inning,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Barker's two-run single in the eighth made it a four-run
lead, but Brant Brown's solo homer off Cabrera gave the Pirates
hope in the bottom of the inning. Wagner squelched that rally, and
Henry handled the ninth to pull the Astros to within a game of .500
on what has been a trying road trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often the Astros win two of five games and none of the
wins is credited to Mike Hampton, Jose Lima or Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to those guys in their last starts is not going
to happen very often,'' Elarton said. ``They just had a bad day.
It's good to know that (Chris Holt) and I can give us some strong
innings, too.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You know how it is. Athletes want to be rock
stars, rock stars want to be athletes, and ordinary folks just want
to be around either one.
</P>
<P>
   So at All-Star Smash Hits on Tuesday at Municipal Auditorium, a
lot of people got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The DuPont World TeamTennis event, in which musician Elton
John's team won 21-17 over the team captained by tennis legend
Billie Jean King, raised money for AIDS awareness and prevention,
and provided quite a few laughs for the 5,793 in attendance.

   From the tennis standpoint, four-time U.S. Open and three-time
Wimbledon champion John McEnroe said, ``It's about 80-90 percent
fun. But you want to show you can still swat a few balls around.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Martina Navratilova, who won a record 167 singles titles
during her pro career, said, ``We're all very nice to each other
until near the end. Then the blood starts to flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The tennis just wasn't the old-timer stuff, though. The No. 1
men's player, Andre Agassi, and No. 6 women's player, Mary Pierce,
also were part of the event. So was Alexandra Stevenson, an
18-year-old player who made it to the Wimbledon semifinals in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is three generations of tennis,'' King said
during a news conference with her team of Agassi, Stevenson, Bob
Bryan and Mariaan de Swardt, who plays for the World TeamTennis'
Kansas City Explorers. ``Young, middle-aged and...mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, 29, piped up, ``Which am I?''
</P>
<P>
   King responded, ``You're middle-aged.''
</P>
<P>
   In tennis years, that's right. In real life, the middle-ager is
the 55-year-old King, with beat-up knees but boundless energy. She
and John met in 1973, just before her ``Battle of the Sexes''
victory over Bobby Riggs, and have been friends ever since.
</P>
<P>
   King founded World TeamTennis, and John wrote the hit song
``Philadelphia Freedom'' in honor of the Philly team King played
for in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like little kids together,'' King said. ``We've always
just connected like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the seventh Smash Hits event they've conducted, the
first in Kansas City. None of the participants was paid. All
proceeds go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation and two local groups,
the Heart of America Community AIDS Partnership and Design
Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Smash Hits events have raised about $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Preceeding the tennis was an auction, at which the top bid was
Nancy Kauffman's $25,000 for four tickets to John's post-Oscars
party in Beverly Hills, Calif., next March. The auction raised
$128,875, approximately 50 percent of which stays with the local
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The best auctioneer proved to be Agassi, who got $10,500 for the
racket he used to win the U.S. Open title a week and half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fun for those at the auction, though, was just
seeing so many superstars live and in person, a dream come true for
some. Meanwhile, John was asked whether a dream of his would be to
switch places with a pro tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could answer, McEnroe tried his hand at singing,
warbling the opening of ``Rocket Man'': ``She packed my bags last
night...''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't everybody want to be a rock star? Or an athlete?

55 CHARTER SCHOOLS IN HOT WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA BIGGS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix officials said Tuesday that they will shut down as many
as 55 charter schools unless the institutions confirm that they
have met legal occupancy requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the 55 schools lack certificates of
occupancy, documents that show the institutions meet health, safety
and other conditions required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems at the schools could range from such minor
areas as landscaping to serious matters like health and safety
issues, said Alan Olson, Phoenix assistant director of development
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to shut anybody down for minor, inconsequential
issues,'' Olson said. ``But if we find major safety issues . . . we
have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that the city sent out notification letters Monday to
27 of the schools, and that about a dozen responded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other 28 letters will be sent out next week. The schools
have 10 days to respond or be found in non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Calls late Tuesday to several of the first 27 schools went
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
said Tuesday that she believes the city's concern is a legitimate
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been unhappy with what I think was some loose record
keeping,'' Keegan said. ``That does not mean we've got 55 schools
out there that are unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keegan called the city's action ``a good opportunity to go
back and check that everyone's got their things in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about charter schools were raised earlier this month
when a downtown Phoenix institution was found to be in violation of
fire-safety regulations. Sterling Academy of Mathematics and
Sciences, chartered by the Peach Springs Unified School District in
far northwestern Arizona, remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterling case evoked a statement of concern from Gov. Jane
Hull and prompted the state fire marshal to order inspections of
every Arizona charter school within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Wolfe, a charter-school consultant who serves on the
board of EduPreneurship Student Center, said some charters located
in churches had received a mixed message regarding certificates of
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gray area not long ago where the schools were
being told if the church had a certificate of occupancy that
included the classrooms, that was good enough,'' she said. ``That's
why I think a bunch of these are getting caught.''
</P>
<P>
   EduPreneurship's Phoenix campus is one of the 27 schools
receiving notice from the city. However, many of the other schools
on the list are not operating in churches.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan agreed that some schools might be operating under the
mistaken notion that their building's former certificate of
occupancy remains valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like buying a car and not changing the name on the
title,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that the state has 380 charter schools and that
only a handful has exhibited problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing pains,'' Keegan said. ``The most important thing
is, Number 1, are the kids safe? Is it academically sound and is
the money being followed well?'' &QL;

 Sponsor of abortion bill accuses governor of making a political
threat  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The House sponsor of a bitterly debated
abortion bill on Tuesday accused Gov. Mel Carnahan, a fellow
Democrat, of having leveled a political threat against him before
last week's showdown over the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville Democrat, said Carnahan
told him at a late-night meeting in his Capitol office that he
``would turn Catholic women against me'' in Luetkenhaus'
legislative district if lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said Carnahan knows there are numerous Catholic
voters in his eastern Missouri legislative district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Are you threatening me, Governor?' And then he
changed the subject,'' Luetkenhaus recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my response was, `Governor, are you threatening me for
fighting for something I believe in?' '' he said. ``Then he danced
around the issue and moved to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he interpreted Carnahan's comments, Luetkenhaus said
Tuesday, ``I took it as a threat, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said he expected primary opposition next year for
the first time since he was elected to the House in 1992. He said
he did not know whether the governor would get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nachtigal, Carnahan's press secretary, disputed
Luetkenhaus' allegations and said the meeting focused on
differences over the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there was no discussion of reprisals or the governor
lining up primary opponents or campaigning against any Democrats
who didn't side with him,'' Nachtigal said Tuesday from Chicago,
where the governor was traveling. ``Those threats, real or implied,
just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus is one of the leaders of the House anti-abortion
forces. Carnahan, who favors abortion rights, waged an intense
campaign to have his veto sustained.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the meeting, the House, at the urging of
Luetkenhaus, overrode Carnahan's veto, 127-34, and the Missouri
Senate did the same the following day. It was a rebuke to the
governor, especially since his fellow Democrats control both
chambers, and was just the third time this century that a
governor's veto had been overridden.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said the bill would ban a late-term abortion procedure _
which they label ``partial-birth'' abortion _ by classifying it as
infanticide. Carnahan contends that the legislation would ban
abortions as early as 5 weeks of gestation and provide a legal
defense for violence against abortion doctors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright issued a temporary
restraining order against the new law on Friday after a lawsuit was
filed that challenged its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said his meeting with Carnahan lasted from about 9
p.m. to 11:30 p.m. and included Chris Sifford, gubernatorial chief
of staff. Nachtigal, however, said Sifford denied Luetkenhaus'
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said that while the session was polite and civil,
the governor was clearly agitated by his stance.
</P>
<P>
   He said Carnahan had accused him of ``playing God with women's
lives'' because the measure failed to include a health exception.
Luetkenhaus said he replied that the bill allowed the procedure to
save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Carnahan: ``I am not playing God. I pray to God,
and that is why I am able to sit here and take this kind of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he changed the subject again.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said Carnahan also made a general comment about
turning women against other lawmakers who voted to override his
veto.

GREER'S INJURY A SCARY SITUATION FOR THE STRETCH DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ They were cruising along with the greatest of
first-place ease.
</P>
<P>
   The manager and general manager had new contracts. The catcher
was batting .331. The magic number was seven, and counting.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear evening such as last night, the Rangers could see
October.
</P>
<P>
   Except, alas, for left fielder Rusty Greer, who had enough
trouble seeing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the fifth inning against the Baltimore Orioles,
Roberto Kelly took Greer's place in left field. The terse
announcement in the press box said only that Greer was removed from
the game after ``experiencing discomfort in his left eye.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same left eye, of course, that served as a catcher's
mitt for a ball thrown by teammate Rick Helling nine days ago. The
same left eye that Greer said ``couldn't see anything'' in the
minutes after the accident. The same left eye that doctors had
checked, rechecked and finally diagnosed as being back to 20-20.
</P>
<P>
   The only left eye that Rusty Greer has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made that Greer will be checked today by
both an opthamologist and a retina specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but for lack of a better word, this is
scary news. We're talking about an eyeball here, not a pulled groin
or a sore elbow. We're talking about a vital chord in the lineup's
nine-piece harmony. We're talking about a career here, not just a
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's scary,'' Greer admitted after the game. ``It's
scary because more than anything, you don't know when it's going to
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me squeamish, but talk of eyeballs sends chills up my
spine. A broken foot _ no problem. A fastball off the top of the
noggin' _ no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But start talking about poking eyeballs, and I get weak in the
knees. In grammar school, a kid in my class used to be able to turn
his eyelids inside out. Every time he did it at recess, which was
almost daily, I would feel like throwing up.
</P>
<P>
   While working out in the outfield before a game last week in
Kansas City, Greer walked smack into a long-toss pitch thrown by
Helling. It made a sound, Rusty says, that he'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Rangers don't need this. Greer is batting .302 and
was poised for his first 20-home run, 100-runs-batted-in season. He
bats third in the order and, as his 102 runs scored attest, he is a
vital piece in the Rangers' vision of a bright postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Greer said he felt no pain, but reported experiencing blurred
vision during his second at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blurry from the outfield, not so much at shorter
distances,'' Greer said, as a post-game media crowd gathered around
him. ``I just felt uncomfortable out there and didn't want to cost
the ballclub. That's when I went to Johnny and asked to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a thing, of course, that I don't normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Except when he runs into walls, Greer almost always plays. But
in 1996, he ran into the wall at Cleveland and fractured a rib in
his right side. Greer missed 15 critical games from Sept. 6-20, and
the Rangers went 6-9, disappearing from the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, including last night's 4-2 defeat, the team is
4-3 since Greer's eye injury. Not exactly a late-season collapse,
but . . . it's an eyeball we're talking about here. Didn't that
have something to do with Kirby Puckett's retirement?
</P>
<P>
   At his locker, Rusty offered one possible explanation. Though he
had worked out in recent days, he had not performed under game
conditions. He also had taken batting practice, but had neither hit
nor tried to catch fly balls under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just the fact that I got whacked in the eye and
it's only been eight days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial examination, doctors assured Greer that the
eye would get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when?'' Rusty wondered last night. ``Does that happen
tomorrow? Two weeks from now? Two months?''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, we are reminded at times like this, isn't called
hardball for nothing. The mind races and thinks about Don Slaught,
Dickie Thon _ both of them one-time Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize,'' Greer said, soberly, ``it's not only life, but
career and everything else we're talking about here.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of losing Rusty Greer at this point should scare all
Rangers fans sily.
</P>
<P>
   It's an eyeball we're talking about. And suddenly, October
doesn't seem all that clear.

STUDY FINDS CALIFORNIA HEALTH `CRISIS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The popular image of healthy Californians who eat
well and exercise frequently took a hit Tuesday in a state report
that found adults are eating more burgers and fries and fewer
fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those surveyed also exercised less than twice
a week, and obesity has increased as a result, according to the
California Dietary Practices Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the number of people who ate fast food the day
before they were surveyed jumped to 48 percent in 1997, as compared
with 37 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really in the throes of a public health crisis,'' said
Desiree Backman, a nutritionist and public health doctor for the
state Department of Health Services. ``It's very startling and very
serious. We thought we were doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend Californians can't be proud of setting.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley said Tuesday
that they were concerned about eating healthy meals, but ate fast
food occasionally because they were pressed for time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bagwell ended a long day with a large cheeseburger, fries
and a shake at a Fat Burger restaurant in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my rare treat,'' he said. ``I just don't feel like
doing any cooking tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The private school administrator said he starts each day with
yogurt, enjoys steamed vegetables and lots of fruit. But he's not
surprised that more adults eat out these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a time-crunch thing, but I also think the value
of meals isn't stressed as much anymore,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Another customer at the Fat Burger had a particularly busy
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely time. I just got off from work, plus I'm going
to school and have a kid,'' said Amber Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings are troubling given how much more is
generally known these days about the benefits of healthy eating and
regular exercise, public health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of poor diet and physical inactivity is the
second-greatest preventable cause of death, behind only tobacco
use. Some 35,000 Californians will die from heart attacks, strokes,
diabetes and other illnesses as a result this year, public health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the richest agricultural state in the world, yet
we're passing up healthy foods like fruit, vegetables and low-fat
milk for foods high in fat and added sugar,'' said state Health
Officer James Stratton. ``These eating habits will cause more
illness, premature deaths and increased health care costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, public health officials this year launched stronger
educational outreach efforts to encourage healthier eating and
exercise. The campaign includes public service announcements,
brochures, promotions in stores, billboard advertising, community
events and even a photo documentary highlighting California women
who improved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has been conducted every two years since 1989,
through 1997. More than 5,000 adult men and women were surveyed
over those years.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials for the first time compared the results
across the eight-year period and also factored in the results of an
annual state health department survey that assesses exercise and
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Key findings include:
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables: 33 percent of adults ate five daily
servings in 1989 and 1997, but that had increased to 37 percent in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Whole grains: 44 percent of adults didn't eat any whole grain
breads, corn tortillas or high fiber cereal on the survey day in
1997, compared with 40 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Milk products: 23 percent of adults consumed no milk, cheese or
other milk products daily in 1997, compared with 24 percent in
1991, which was the first year this category was included.
</P>
<P>
   Meat: In one of the few positive findings, 68 percent of adults
ate red meat fewer than three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Beans: Another positive finding was that 30 percent of adults
ate beans every other day in 1997, compared with 22 percent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do adults appear to have less time to eat right, they
also fail to exercise at least 20 minutes a day, two days a week.
The percentage of adults who do not meet that goal increased from
49 percent in 1984 to 54 percent in 1996, according to the separate
state study on behavioral risks.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: behavioral risks.
</P>
<P>
   That study also found that 28 percent of men were overweight or
obese in 1997 compared with 19 percent in 1984. For women, 28
percent were overweight or obese in 1997 compared with 17 percent
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise can be easy. Walking around the neighborhood, working
in the garden, playing with kids often is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can allocate our time a little each day, that does so
much to keep our heart healthy, reduce our risk for cancer and keep
our body weight in balance,'' Backman said.
</P>
<P>
   One answer has been a state health program that encourages
healthy nutrition and physical activity through health fairs,
community events, school programs and other outreach efforts. Los
Angeles County has one of the 10 Project LEAN _ Leaders Encouraging
Activity and Nutrition _ programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make good nutrition fun, to make it a
lifestyle choice,'' said Sharon Miles Eller, the registered
dietitian leading the Los Angeles program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a whole it's just small changes, just a little bit here and
a little bit there,'' she said. ``You don't need to never have
french fries again. You don't have to be a marathon runner, you can
walk around the block a few times a week.''

5 YEARS LATER, TRIAL AP PROACHES FOR MOM, BEAU 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Five years after a convicted prostitute and her mentally
retarded boyfriend were charged with killing her two small
children, neither has gone to trial and they have lived in a
Maricopa County jail longer than anyone else awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Greer, 32, and Brent Linner, 29, were charged in
December 1994 with first-degree murder and child abuse in the
deaths of Henry, 5, and Odessa, 3, who police say were beaten with
tennis rackets, drowned in a bathtub, wrapped in garbage bags and
pushed 10 &UR; feet down a sewer line under a manhole cover.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago this week, the children were discovered. They had
been murdered up to four months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly tale of the Greer children of Phoenix dominated the
news in late 1994 and raised questions once again about child
welfare in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 30 postponements, Greer, who has a history of mental
illness and drug addiction, is expected to be tried on Nov. 15, and
Linner, diagnosed as severely retarded, is slated for trial Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, homicide defendants go to court in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pages of court records in the case document delays
typical of a court system that has been grappling with ways to move
criminal cases more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The postponements were caused, in part, by a tangle of
scheduling conflicts between prosecutors and defense attorneys who
were juggling multiple cases. There were also changes in judges
scheduled to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Paula Davey, who had herself appointed the victim
advocate for the dead children, is outraged over the delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want these children to be forgotten,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Loretta Greer has been the architect of
many of the delays. In some instances, she has refused to go to
court. She has dismissed two court-appointed attorneys, and she has
delayed her trial for two years by apparently faking symptoms of
mental illness, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1996, Greer tried to convince court officials that
she was mentally incapable of assisting in her defense and should
not go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1996, Commissioner Carey Hyatt declared her
competent to stand trial because she said Greer was ``intentionally
producing general or exaggerated psychological symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Linner was declared fit to stand trial within a year after he
was charged with murder. Greer's demands also delayed Linner's
trial as they were originally to be tried together. The decision to
try them separately was made only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's bizarre behavior is a legend in the courthouse. In some
appearances, she has yelled or hummed. Once, she had to be tied
into a wheelchair with a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very manipulative,'' said Luis Calvo, one of her fired
attorneys. ``She tries to take charge in court.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greer is confined to a special section of the jail reserved for
the most troublesome inmates and has a single cell.
</P>
<P>
   Linner and Greer were charged in December 1994, but she had been
in jail since September, and he since November on unrelated
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's care alone has cost county taxpayers $66,950, based on
the typical $35 daily cost of keeping an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Since she has been in custody, Greer has also sent the jail into
turmoil, filing 719 grievances in 1998 alone, including claims that
her food is poisoned, that other inmates call her ``baby killer''
and that slamming cell doors keep her awake at night. &QL; 
READY FOR TRIALS
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley does not fault judges for
the delays, saying they have to be sure that Greer and Linner can
assist in their defenses. If those issues were ignored, he said,
convictions could be reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he says, ``We continue to argue that we are ready
to go to trial but, ultimately, the decision is up to the court.
There is no way to intervene at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer is to be tried by Judge Bernard Dougherty; Linner by Judge
Paul Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Court rules prohibit judges from discussing active cases.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for Greer. But in
July, they said they would not seek Linner's execution, in part
because of his mental retardation. &QL; 
DEATH DESCRIPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   In a March jailhouse interview requested by ``The Arizona
Republic,'' Greer blamed Linner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voices told him to kill right around the time of the murder,''
Greer said, saying she can't recall what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was strayed from the here and now,'' she said. ``All I know
is that what I was going through was very scary. Demons were trying
to take me away.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with police in 1994, Linner told them that Greer
beat the children with the tennis racket, then drowned them. Greer
wove a different story, telling police that they died three weeks
apart. She doesn't specify dates.
</P>
<P>
   Henry died first, she said, after he fell and hit his head, then
drowned. ``Brent said he would get rid of the body,'' she told
police, but didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted hitting Henry with a tennis racket four times the
day he died. And she said she struck Odessa with a 16-inch-long rod
about two weeks before she &UR; found her dead in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The day she died, Odessa had been left in the closet for 18
hours, Greer told police. She said she and Linner decided to put
the 3-year-old in the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the children died. Court records say it was
sometime between May and July 1994. Their decomposed bodies were
found only after Linner led police to a manhole cover near their
36th Avenue and Osborn Road apartment on Sept. 20, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Linner took police to the bodies because he said he was angry
with Greer for hitting him over the head with a pot.
</P>
<P>
   From jail, Greer, who has two other children in foster care,
insists that ``there is no mother who loves her babies more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a monster like that,'' she said. &QL;

SCIOSCIA'S PATH HEADS AWAY FROM L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Scioscia, the former Los Angeles Dodgers
catcher, coach, minor-league instructor and Triple-A manager, is
immortalized in name and picture on Dodger Stadium's left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   That's him between Don Newcombe, the intimidating right-hander
of the 1950s, and Bud Light, the paying advertiser of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving an organization that thinks so highly of you should be
heart-rending. But, as the intrusion of the Bud Light ad on the
fence demonstrates, these are not the same Dodgers who signed
Scioscia when he was 17, who made it to the 1988 World Series
because of his playoff home run, who saw him as the logical heir to
another another Pennsylvania-born Italian-American named Tom
Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to take a little piece of the organization
with you,'' Scioscia said Tuesday morning on the phone from his
Agoura home. ``But realistically, the organization I grew up with
and the people in place now are different. I'm not saying it's
better or worse. It's just different.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, there is ``nothing to be sad about'' in his parting
with the Dodgers, made official by Monday night's announcement that
Scioscia is leaving the Albuquerque Dukes managing job after one
season to pursue opportunities with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about some opportunities out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to be sad about?
</P>
<P>
   That's not for him to say, is it?
</P>
<P>
   It might be a happy day for Scioscia but a sad one for the team
and its fans, who say goodbye to a blue-collar hero.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, 40, probably is better off cutting the cord to the
club for which he caught a Dodgers-record 1,395 games and
stonewalled a zillion would-be run-scorers between 1980 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he'd been the team's manager of the future, the
favorite over former teammate Bill Russell to succeed Lasorda. But
Scioscia seemed to fall behind in that race when he chose a job as
the Dodgers' farm-system catching coordinator over minor-league and
winter-league managing jobs that would have fleshed out his resume.
</P>
<P>
   When Lasorda was pushed out of the Dodgers manager's office
after a heart scare in 1996, Russell replaced him and Scioscia
joined Russell's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russell was fired, Glenn Hoffman was installed and Hoffman
was replaced last offseason by outsider Davey Johnson. Scioscia,
sent off to manage the Peoria Javalinas of the Arizona Fall League
and Albuqerque of the Pacific Coast League, gained more and more
experience and less and less hope of applying it.
</P>
<P>
   In evaluation sessions with general manager Kevin Malone and
minor-leagues assistant Bill Geivett over the past couple of weeks,
Scioscia was told he didn't have a future with the Dodgers,
certainly not the one he coveted. This week's parting was a mutual
decision.
</P>
<P>
   For this he had passed up coaching jobs with other major-league
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to explore some of those opportunities,''
Scioscia said. ``There are going to be some opportunities out there
now for managers.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know if a major-league team will hire him for the
2000 season, ``but I think it will happen eventually,'' he said.
``I feel I'm qualified. I feel like the six years I spent (coaching
and managing) in the organization have given me an understanding of
this side of the game and what I need to do to motivate a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is magnanimous with praise for the men who stood
between him and the Dodgers manager's seat. Johnson, he said, has
done a ``good job,'' never mind the team's poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson returned the praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I hear Scioscia is leaving?'' Johnson said in his
clubhouse office Monday night after the Dodgers' ninth-inning
victory over the San Francisco Giants. ``I'm sorry to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated him,'' Johnson added with a cheeky smile.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to 1988, the National League championship
series, Game 4, ninth inning. Johnson was managing the New York
Mets against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were three outs from a three-games-to-one lead in the
best-of-seven series when Dwight Gooden left a fastball on the
inside corner of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who'd hit three home runs all season, yanked it over
the right-field wall to tie the game, which the Dodgers won in 12
innings.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Scioscia's homer, Kirk Gibson never hits his.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '88 he wasn't my favorite player,'' Johnson said. ``But I
got to know him in spring training and he's a good baseball man,
and he'll be missed. He has my blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the memory of '88 fades a little further, a happy
development for the Mets and the Oakland A's, a sad one for the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia is gone and only his spot on the left-field wall
remains, at least until it's sold to an oil company. &QL;

SPECIAL BOARD TO STUDY LAPD OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Staff Writer Troy Anderson contributed to this story 
BY RICK ORLOV AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fighting to restore the LAPD's credibility,
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks announced that he has launched an
unprecedented Board of Inquiry investigation of the entire
department in the wake of the Rampart Division corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The board _ 60 command staffers above the rank of captain with a
six-week deadline _ will examine whether the LAPD is plagued by the
same failed procedures and policies that allowed Officer Rafael
Perez to steal eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker and
frame a 22-year-old illegal immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said a criminal probe will continue on a parallel track,
focusing on Perez and 11 other officers who have been suspended in
the wake of Perez's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good likelihood more officers will be identified as
the investigation continues,'' Parks said after testifying before
the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue running down every lead. We may end up with a
lot of information we can't prove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a citywide agency, and we will look throughout the
department for problems. When we go to someone's house at 2 in the
morning, we have to have the public's confidence to let us in.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks' announcement came amid the following developments in the
deepening LAPD corruption scandal:
</P>
<P>
   Police Commission Inspector General Jeff Eglash said he will
monitor the investigations, and Parks and the City Council assured
him he will receive access to all documents and resources.
</P>
<P>
   An injunction against the 18th Street gang that was based on
former Officer Perez's testimony was suspended by a judge partly
because of inaccuracies in his statements.
</P>
<P>
   City and county officials urged the re-establishment of the
district attorney's team to investigate officer-involved shootings
independently of the police. It was disbanded in 1996 for lack of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a backstop. It's insurance against a breakdown in the
integrity of the system,'' said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, urged the Police
Commission to investigate the ``de facto custody'' of Javier
Francisco Ovando, the 22-year-old illegal immigrant allegedly
framed by Perez and his partner, Officer Nino Durden, in an October
1996 assault that left Ovando paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commission President Gerald Chaleff said it was too early
to determine whether a commission investigation is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding that Mr. Ovando's wishes are being
respected. But if facts come to light that require us looking into
the matter, we most certainly will.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Ovando is not in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been free to come or go, to call whoever he wishes,''
Parks said. ``We are providing security, but he is not in any form
of custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who have accused the LAPD of holding Ovando against
his will have other motives, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motives of the attorneys who say otherwise had no concern
for Ovando until they realized they had an opportunity to sue the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovando said in an interview that he has requested police
protection because of the media attention and uncertainties he
faces now that he's out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thanks God that he is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined that all this was going to happen. But as you
see, I came out free,'' Ovando, speaking in Spanish from inside a
police facility to KABC-TV (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Perez believes he will need five more days to divulge
all he knows about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of an investigation,'' Parks said. ``We have
to document everything he says, and we want more clarification on
everything he has raised. That's the way it goes. You start with A
and go to Z. You don't start at Z and work backwards. We will go
wherever this takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he is stepping up training of officers to end the
``code of silence'' in which officers refuse to inform superiors of
any misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said the department is preparing a guide for officers
on false and misleading statements.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the scandal has severely affected morale throughout
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects everyone, us, the community, the City Council,''
Parks said. ``Officers are the most visual part of city government
and the only legacy officers have is their word, their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens it takes that credibility
away and has a major impact on the city.''
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: impact on the city.''
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn said prosecutors will go to court today
to seek a suspension on the MacArthur Park gang injunction,
following a Superior Court judge's suspension for one month of an
injunction against the 18th Street gang in the Pico-Union area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to review this and hope we can come back to court to
get these reinstated,'' Hahn said. ``We worked very hard on it, but
the bottom line is that if we don't have confidence in the
declarations given to us (in support of a judicial order), we can't
ask the court to continue enforcement of the injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   The injunctions are in jeopardy because of testimony concerning
Ovando. Perez told investigators it was Durden who shot Ovando.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said his office is in the process of working with the
District Attorney's Office in reviewing every case in which Perez
was a witness and he also voiced concern of the potential liability
facing the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have big payouts in jury trials, it's because the
jury is mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD Board of Inquiry _ the largest ever assembled _ will
include a fresh look at the Rampart Division anti-gang unit in
which Perez worked and whether it had enough supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Because of space problems at Rampart, the unit was provided with
its own space in offices away from the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that might have caused some of the problem,'' said an
official familiar with the inquiry. ``They were basically on their
own, with no one watching them. Not a watch commander. Not a
captain.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Police Commission meeting, Chaleff emphasized that
Eglash will have ``complete access'' to all documents and every
step taken in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be able to look at every sensitive document, go to
every meeting, every interview that is conducted. He will have
absolute, complete access.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ Some years ago, the owner of another NFL team helped
broker the purchase of the San Francisco 49ers by the Eddie
DeBartolo clan, father and son.
</P>
<P>
   The Morabito brothers were the sellers, meaning that on both
sides the deal was all in the family. At the closing, one of the
Morabitos announced there had been unexpected expenses and the
price had gone up a million.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie DeBartolo Sr. leaped from his seat and growled, ``I won't
pay it. I don't do business that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The attendant owner was beside him, and also beside himself. He
tugged at the elder DeBartolo's sleeve and whispered, ``Eddie, let
me to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved to an adjoining room, and the middleman went straight
to the bottom line: ``Pay the million. Get the deal done. It's
still a sweeter deal than you can imagine.'' While Senior was
thinking it over, the kid was jumping up and down, telling him,
``Listen to him, Dad. He knows what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was done. A few weeks later, the NFL announced that the
new contract for television rights had tripled over the previous
payment. Suddenly, the million-dollar bump seemed like
popcorn-and-candy money.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers became the team of the '80s with Eddie Jr. running the
show and spending freely until he was sacked by legal woes and
forced to yield his control of the franchise. The NFL giveth, and
the NFL taketh away.
</P>
<P>
   Which bring us to the latest turn on the yellow brick road that
may or may not lead to an expansion franchise, the league's 32nd
and last as far into the future as your eyes can see.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Los Angeles is down to its final bidder, Marvin
Davis, a poor but humble billionaire who up to now has led a
sheltered life as a movie mogul and oilman. Davis is said to have
told the NFL he will not quibble over the franchise, rumored to
cost above $500 million, and is prepared to pay for a stadium on
land he has optioned at Hollywood Park. At 74, he wants his two
sons, Gregg and John, to manage the investment.
</P>
<P>
   A new element to the deal is the expressed interest of John
Elway as a shareholder and potential team president. The inclusion
of Elway on his side adds depth to the Davis bid, although it isn't
clear he would bring cash to the table, even though he sold his
shares in a national car chain for $85 million. Also, it has
occurred to many fans that John is not finished doing God's work in
the huddle of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Davis has been mentioned as a possible buyer of the
Dodgers, Cowboys, Broncos and Oakland A's. But no deals were
struck, proving this may be a shrewd horse trader or merely someone
whose name is easily dropped.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis is indeed willing and able to shell out nearly a
billion for the franchise fee and sports complex, sources say the
NFL might drop its demand for a significant amount of tax dollars.
Up to now, this policy has been depicted as a test of community
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the speculation spins and buzzes here, the league's
expansion committee is reported to be talking with Bob McNair,
trying to negotiate the final price of a franchise in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As of the moment, we can hold these truths to be self-evident:
The owners have been impressed with McNair's persistence, his hard
work, his net worth, his willingness to meet their conditions. Even
those who don't like anybody seem to like McNair.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an owner who lavishes praise on McNair offers
nary an encouraging word. ``He's a great guy,'' this owner says,
``but they are going to shaft him. He doesn't know it, but they are
going to shaft him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one who has followed his effort can doubt that McNair
deserves a franchise _ if you think owning an NFL team is a good
thing to have happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners are still on the fence about expanding at all,
preferring to go with none of the above for the time being. The
pressure to admit Los Angeles is being brought by the networks, to
which the owners often respond in unison, ``Yes, boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's television contract is heavily back-loaded, up to
2003, and there is strong sentiment not to expand the lodge until
after that date.
</P>
<P>
   There is still skepticism that Marvin Davis will prove to be the
man, or Los Angeles the city. But on the drive into town Tuesday,
the gentleman behind the wheel said, ``You hear that there is a lot
of apathy in this town, but that isn't what I hear. The other day
the Los Angeles Daily News ran a poll, and 79 percent of the voters
said they would take back Al Davis and the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that surprised me. I bet it even surprised Al Davis.''

U.S. TO SUE TOBACCO FIRMS IN BID TO RECOVER HEALTH COSTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is about to file a civil
suit against the tobacco industry, seeking to recover billions of
dollars in health-related expenses that cigarette smoking has cost
over the decades, a government official said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department believes smoking-related illnesses have
cost the American taxpayers billions of dollars, and it is seeking
ways to get the taxpayers' money back,'' said the government
official, who is familiar with the unfolding case and spoke Tuesday
night on condition he not be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuit had been expected since President Clinton
first proposed it in his State of the Union address last January,
it is still a blow to the industry, which had thought it had put
most of its legal problems behind it by settling hundreds of
millions of dollars in lawsuits by the states and beating back
congressional efforts to strongly regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the tobacco industry reached Tuesday night said he
was unaware of an imminent legal action by the government. But in
recent months officials from tobacco companies and a public
relations firm hired by the industry have conducted an aggressive
campaign depicting any federal lawsuit as ungrounded and legally
unviable. An effort was made in Congress this year to curtail
financing the Justice Department would need to pay for the
litigation against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Following the State of the Union, the cigarette industry said
the president's remarks were ``blatantly political'' and meant to
demonize the tobacco companies. People who had long followed
tobacco litigation said the cigarette makers were rattled by the
prospect of facing an adversary _ the federal government _ with
pockets as deep as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which has been planned for nearly a year, may allege
that cigarette smoking has cost as much as $25 billion a year from
the effects of lung cancer and other diseases linked to the smoking
habit. The $25 billion is calculated from the numbers of health
claims paid to veterans and the elderly through Medicare, according
to The Washington Post, which reported on the impending suit in its
Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The official would not discuss the exact timing of the suit &UR; , &LR; 
but he made it clear that it is about to be lodged. &UR;  &LR; An
anti-smoking advocate said Tuesday night that a Justice Department
official had told him that the announcement would be made at a news
conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 states settled with tobacco companies for a total
of $206 billion for health costs the states had been saddled with
over the years because of smoking. Four other states had settled
similar claims earlier in a separate action.
</P>
<P>
   So at the start of 1999, the tobacco industry thought it had
insured its survival and perhaps even its prosperity, albeit at a
huge cost. The $206 billion is to be paid over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement that his administration would seek
recompense separate from the money to be paid to the states
surprised many Justice Department lawyers, as well as attorneys for
tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear signal of its seriousness, the Justice Department in
April hired a Minnesota law firm that had represented that state in
its action against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that as part of its suit, to be filed in U.S.
District Court, the Justice Department will contend that the
tobacco companies engaged in civil racketeering. The suit will
allege industrywide collusion in consumer fraud to conceal the
risks of smoking, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state lawsuits were intended to recover health care
costs spent through the Medicaid program on low-income patients,
the federal government is seeking to recover similar expenses spent
treating the elderly through the Medicare program. The action is
also seeking reimbursement of costs spent treating smoking-related
ills among both active and retired military personnel and
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the Minnesota firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP;
Ciresi of Minneapolis, brought a scathing response from the tobacco
industry. ``The administration has handed the keys to the Justice
Department over to the trial lawyers,'' an industry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department said there was no arrangement for the
firm to get contingency fees if the government prevailed in a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the soon-to-be filed federal suit are unclear,
but lawyers involved in it have long said it would aim to win
concessions not included in the settlements between the big tobacco
companies and the states. These might include federal power to
regulate nicotine under the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   It also became widely known soon after the president's
announcement that some lawyers in the Justice Department were
unhappy that Clinton had, in effect, tipped off the tobacco
companies well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the tobacco industry enjoyed near-invincibility in
the courtroom. Able to spend as much as necessary on legal counsel,
it was able to defeat virtually every lawsuit filed against
cigarette makers by longtime smokers who had become ill.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past several years, the tide has turned. The sight of
several tobacco executives swearing under oath in a congressional
hearing room that they did not believe nicotine was addictive was
offensive even to those who had not seriously pondered the danger
of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have been more vulnerable in courthouses
recently, and more vulnerable too in the court of public opinion,
as the dangers of smoking and the hazards of ``second-hand smoke''
have been widely publicized.

GROCERIES JOIN BIG ITEMS ON A NAME-YOUR-PRICE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Priceline.com Inc., an online bidding site for
big-ticket purchases like airline tickets and automobiles, plans to
begin offering consumers in the New York area cut-rate prices on
groceries like applesauce and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal announced Tuesday, Priceline will license its
trademark and software to Priceline.com Webhouse Club Inc., a new
venture through which consumers can set the prices they are willing
to pay for grocery store staples ranging from disposable razors to
peanut butter. If participating supermarkets accept the prices, the
purchases can be picked up at the stores with a shopping list
reflecting the discounts. Consumers will print out the discount
lists from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Nov. 1, 600 supermarkets in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, including Food Emporium, A&AMP;P and D'Agostino, will
begin taking part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, shoppers looking to shave costs from their grocery
bills can log on to the Webhouse Club at Priceline.com and name
their preferred price on a particular item. If the bid is accepted,
the price is locked in and the cost of the item is charged to the
customer's credit card. Members print out their private price lists
and go to the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new way to save money,'' said Walter D'Agostino,
of D'Agostino supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but shoppers would be well advised not to count on
buying a case of Coke for a buck or lobster tails for $1.99.
Customers will receive up to 40 percent off regular store prices
and half off on some goods.
</P>
<P>
   By offering a new way to save, Webhouse and its retail partners
are taking aim at buy-in-bulk price clubs and a growing number of
online supermarket operators.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Otto, Webhouse's president and chief executive, said,
``Unlike product-ordering Web sites, with their fixed prices,
shipping fees and delayed delivery, we view America's neighborhood
stores as a powerful and unmatched asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts who follow the grocery business said the
Webhouse model might appeal to coupon clippers and online shopping
aficionados but would not likely change the way most people shop
for milk and bread. For one, they said they doubted that harried
shoppers would take the time to point-and-click to bid on an entire
shopping list to save 15 cents on a can of soup or a stick of
deodorant. What is more, many low-income consumers, who would
benefit most from discount pricing, will be virtually excluded from
the savings because getting the discounts requires a computer, an
Internet account and a credit card. After 90 days, users will be
charged $3 per month for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly excited about it,'' said Ray Dirks, an analyst
with Security Capital Trading. ``I really think the larger-price
items are much more appropriate for something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Priceline sees the expansion of its ``name-your-price''
concept to everyday, small-ticket items as a way to expand its
Web-based business.
</P>
<P>
   ``By initially allowing consumers to name their price for
products in more than 140 frequently purchased grocery categories,
and eventually expanding to a much wider variety of retail
categories, the increased traffic to Priceline.com as a whole will
help accelerate the growth of Priceline.com's airline, hotel and
other businesses,'' said Jay Walker, founder and vice chairman of
Priceline, which plans to expand the service nationally by next
year. Priceline, which is based in Stamford, Conn., will also
eventually receive fee-for-referral payments from the participating
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Rakesh Sood, an analyst who follows the company
for Goldman Sachs, is for consumers to become so familiar with
clicking onto Priceline that they eventually turn to the site for
competitive prices on an extended range of goods and services like
rental cars and credit card deals. Retailers hope the concept will
lure more bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Webhouse Club, each of our customers can
electronically tell us what they want to buy and the price they
want to pay,'' said Christian Haub, A&AMP;P's chief executive.

<P>
   Roswell is this television season's most lovable mutt. &QL; 
Part X-Files, part (fill in the Buf fy/Dawson/Felicity teen show of
your choosing here), the show, which premieres Oct. 6, makes
excellent use of the one true thing everybody feels in high school:
I'm different from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Only these kids really are. It's not acne, bad hair or a secret
desire to wear leggings underneath their pants and dance on
Broadway that sets them apart. It's their . . . lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the big spaceship crash in 1947 that the government
keeps covering up? (If you know your X-Files, you do.) Imagine it
really happened. While you're at it, imagine that not all the
aliens were killed _ and that not all were adults. And that just
before the millennium, a network made a show about the survivors.
As a bonus, imagine that they look like refugees from the cover of
Teen People.
</P>
<P>
   Which would make the teens in Roswell more than 50 years old,
but that's people years. Let's not quib ble. Alien years must be
different.
</P>
<P>
   The show takes place in pres ent-day Roswell, N.M., where Liz _
a human, played by Shiri Appleby _ works as a waitress in the
Crashdown Cafe. (Roswell gets bonus cool points for offhandedly
giving entrees out-of-this-world names like the Sigourney Weaver _
you know, she was in the Alien movies. Get it?)
</P>
<P>
   A drunken argument ends with Liz accidentally shot in the chest.
Happily for her, Max (Jason Behr) is on hand _ literally. He heals
her as discreetly as he can. But this being TV, and their being
teens, there's more to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Although she dates the sheriff's lunkheaded son, Liz has her eye
on Max. Having your life saved by your secret crush offers you a
good excuse to talk to him, and soon it's clear that Max has a
thing for Liz, too. But this being TV, and their being teens . . .
well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff totes around some alien baggage of his own, so he's
suspicious. The lunkheaded boy friend doesn't like his girlfriend
hanging out with another guy.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, it's impera tive to Max, his sister and
their friend that no one discover where they're from (``Up north?''
Liz asks innocently when Max points sky ward).
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a 3rd Rock From the Sun that's actually
worth watching, don't believe it _ Ros well's way better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, naturally, say there's more to it than alien
shenanigans, and they're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love story, and all this other stuff is part of telling
that love story,'' Jason Katims said this sum mer. ``The thing with
the aliens is really interesting, but it's (only) an aspect of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects include good writ ing, likable characters and
enough quirkiness to remind you you're not watching Felicity on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the bad-joke police to make an arrest any minute now,
but it must be said: Roswell is, uh, out of this world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Other new Wednesday night shows:
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing  &UR; _ The terrible thing about television: With all
the garbage out there, why should we have to choose between this
and Roswell? Aren't there any other time slots available? Aaron
Sorkin, the brains behind Sports Night (and not coincidentally the
writer of the feature film The American Presi dent), takes a stab
at the White House and draws comic blood. It's witty, if, like
Sports Night, a little talky at times. Well worth watching. Just
like Roswell. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   Get Real  &UR; _ The great thing about television: With two good
shows vying for your time at this hour already, you can skip this
family comedy/drama with Fox atti tude. (Which is to say that when
the moronic son's mom catches a girl spending the night with him,
after worrying a little, she invites her to stay for breakfast.
Kids _ they're so cute at that age.)
</P>
<P>
   Work With Me &UR; _ The worst chemistry since Dr. Jekyll was cooking
up experiments in his lab. Kevin Pollack is no Mr. Hyde _ usually
he's quite likable _ but he and Nancy Travis (usually likable, too)
just don't click as married lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Grow Up _ One roommate just found out he's gay (his wife was
as surprised as he was). Another is a womanizer who discovers he
has a teenage daughter. The third is a Struggling Artist. Oh, and
the dog talks (via subtitles). So why didn't I hate it? Because
somehow the characters are likable, especially Alan Basche as the
artist. Oddly enough, this might grow on you. &QL;

AIRLINES ANNOUNCE `VOLUNTARY' PLEDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because concern about Hurricane Floyd crowded out much other
news last week, few people appear to have noticed that the nation's
airlines filed with the Department of Transportation their pledges
to improve customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The ``voluntary'' pledges, which were actually adopted under
congressional threats to come up with improvements or else, are an
outgrowth of growing customer dissatisfaction with the overall
flight experience, dissatisfaction that boiled over after Detroit
passengers were kept aboard planes for hours last January during a
killer snowstorm hit the city.
</P>
<P>
   Now the airlines have agreed to tell passengers the lowest fare
available for each flight, to notify customers of cancellations,
delays and diversions, to ensure that all written complaints are
responded to within 60 days and to make every reasonable effort to
provide food, water and restroom facilities for on-board passengers
who are on the ground for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that some of the proposals, all of which are
required to go into effect by Dec. 15, are already required by law
or by custom. But some airlines have gone beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, for example, will telephone customers to notify them of
flight cancellations when they are known at least two hours before
departure. (The new pledges provide that airlines notify customers
at the airport or aboard an affected airplane.) Northwest promised
not to hold passengers on-board an aircraft for more than one hour
in the event of an in-bound flight delay. US Airways plans a
consumer advisory board to provide advice on the airline's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   United will deploy 600 high-tech baggage scanners at its busiest
airports, and its web site will list fares from other airlines. In
case of a delay or overbooked flight, Alaska Airlines will offer,
among other things, a kit containing a phone card, snack
certificate and a choice of frequent flier miles or discount off
future travel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of the pledges addressed a big complaint of economy
class passengers: Since airlines continue to jam passengers into
every available inch of space (in fareness, probably because
passengers want rock-bottom fares that just about mandate packing
passengers like sardines), why isn't at least one airline bold
enough or prescient enough to adjust its seats to keep them from
reclining more than an inch or two, instead of into the lap of the
person directly behind.
</P>
<P>
   Air France is offering bargain fares to more than 80 European
cities, including roundtrip fares to Paris for $328 from New York,
Newark and Boston; $388 from Washington; $408 from Atlanta and
Chicago; $478 from San Francisco and $528 from Los Angeles. Good
for departures from Nov. 1 through March 31, 2000, tickets must be
bought no later than Oct. 5. Restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Through midnight this Friday, British Airways has discount fares
available for travel to London from Oct. 1 through Dec. 8.
Examples: From nine East Coast gateways, including Boston, Newark
and New York's Kennedy Airport, $198 for departure on Wednesday,
$300 for departure on Saturday. The corresponding fares for
Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Dallas and Miami are $248 and $350, and
from Denver, Phoenix, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San
Diego, $298 to $400. Restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Delta cut fares yesterday for travel in much of the United
States and to some European destinations, for travel between Oct. 5
and Dec. 15. Fares are said to be as much as 35 percent less than
21-day advance purchase tickets, with even bigger discounts for
booking online. American and Continental matched the discounts.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, Japan Airlines will begin flying between New York and
Sao Paulo, Brazil, four times a week Through Jan. 31. 2000, members
of the airline's frequent flier program will receive double miles,
while first class and business class passengers who buy their
tickets in the United States will also receive door-to-door
limousine service.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, Northwest Airlines will add two additional nonstops a
week between its Minneapolis/St. Paul hub and Tokyo's Narita
airport. The new flights, one on Friday and one on Saturday (the
peak departure days for business travel to Asia), are in addition
to the existing daily nonstops over the same route.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Airlines made it official Tuesday that it is joining
the Star Alliance, effective next summer. The new member will give
the alliance a formidable presence in Central and Eastern Europe,
to complement its presence throughout much of the rest of the
world. The alliance's other members are United Airlines, Air
Canada, Ansett of Australia, Air New Zealand, Lufthansa of Germany,
Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Thai Airways and Varig of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran will take delivery Friday of its first Boeing 717, the
new fuel-efficient jet with 117 seats (including 12 in business
class), 100 percent fresh air and increased overhead storage space.
The airline will add seven more B-717s this year and 42 others
through 2002.

MILD SUMMER ENDS WITH THUNDERSTORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Southern California's cool summer heads out with
a monsoonal bang as thunderstorms hit Tuesday and were expected to
linger into fall's official arrival Thursday _ more weird weather
that was a delight to gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Hilary swooped into the Southland on Tuesday,
bringing fast-moving thunderstorms and humid air. A chance of
showers was expected to continue into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got flooded out. All of our plants got drenched. We won't
have to water them for a while,'' said Teresa Holmes, manager of
Chatsworth Nursery in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, as she
cleaned up after 15 minutes of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said strong winds also knocked down a section of the
nursery's wrought-iron-and-brick back gate, as well as many boxed
trees and displays. ``We got picked on and we weren't prepared. I
didn't even have a rain jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain was reported across the region, from Chatsworth to Woodland
Hills, and from Van Nuys to Ventura County communities and the
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The rainfall was mostly welcome, though, soaking flowers and
plants that already have savored a cool summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean-cooling La Nina weather pattern has kept daytime highs
about 4 degrees below normal through the summer. A year ago,
temperatures were about 3 degrees above normal, said Mark Tobin, a
meteorologist for AccuWeather, a weather forecasting company.
</P>
<P>
   Fall should be warmer and a bit more dry than normal thanks to
La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marine layer sticks around for a longer time during the
day. So in the summertime that keeps us on the cool side. During
the fall and wintertime, those clouds at night will help hold up
our temperatures a little bit,'' Tobin explained.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of much sweltering weather this summer allowed
homeowners and professional landscapers to water less. Plants also
lasted longer.
</P>
<P>
   With autumn's arrival, green-thumbers said this is prime
planting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a head start. Usually, I plant in October,'' said
Barbara Mervau of the West Hills community.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling a cart through a nursery, Mervau packed in pansies,
snapdragons and mums, and several varieties of spring bulbs, as
well as irises.
</P>
<P>
   But she said there isn't as much room in the garden as she
normally has because many plants, including tomatoes and arugula,
have lasted longer this summer. ``Everything looks real good,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The patio garden Thelma Marks tends at her Woodland Hills home
also is looking good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything did well this summer. I had to water a little bit
less and it was good for a lot of my plants,'' she said. ``The hot
sun usually does a job on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Suchomel, a landscaper based in Simi Valley who also
works in the Los Angeles area, said this has been one of the
easiest summers during his 15 years in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great. It's been a really mild summer. You don't
need as much watering and it's easier just keeping things alive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler weather actually has been good for business, Suchomel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people get put off when the weather is hot.
They're afraid to put things in because they think they will die
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually fall is when business gets busy, but being the mild
summer that it's been, business has been pretty steady,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While fall also usually marks the end of peak water demand,
conservation was evident throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power officials said water
demand from June through August was equal to the demand during the
same period in 1998, despite the city's population growth over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   DWP officials said residential customers appear to be continuing
conservation practices that took root during the six-year drought
that gripped Southern California through 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was they were forced into changing how they used
water during the drought and they have kept to that. Cooler weather
only helps that,'' said Rich Harasick, assistant director of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people ought to be proud of themselves for doing that,''
he said.

giving entrees out-of-this-world names like the Sigourney Weaver _
you know, she was in the Alien movies. Get it?)
</P>
<P>
   A drunken argument ends with Liz accidentally shot in the chest.
Happily for her, Max (Jason Behr) is on hand _ literally. He heals
her as discreetly as he can. But this being TV, and their being
teens, there's more to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Although she dates the sheriff's lunkheaded son, Liz has her eye
on Max. Having your life saved by your secret crush offers you a
good excuse to talk to him, and soon it's clear that Max has a
thing for Liz, too. But this being TV, and their being teens . . .
well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff totes around some alien baggage of his own, so he's
suspicious. The lunkheaded boy friend doesn't like his girlfriend
hanging out with another guy.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, it's impera tive to Max, his sister and
their friend that no one discover where they're from (``Up north?''
Liz asks innocently when Max points sky ward).
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a 3rd Rock From the Sun that's actually
worth watching, don't believe it _ Ros well's way better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, naturally, say there's more to it than alien
shenanigans, and they're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love story, and all this other stuff is part of telling
that love story,'' Jason Katims said this sum mer. ``The thing with
the aliens is really interesting, but it's (only) an aspect of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects include good writ ing, likable characters and
enough quirkiness to remind you you're not watching Felicity on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the bad-joke police to make an arrest any minute now,
but it must be said: Roswell is, uh, out of this world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Other new Wednesday night shows:
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing  &UR; _ The terrible thing about television: With all
the garbage out there, why should we have to choose between this
and Roswell? Aren't there any other time slots available? Aaron
Sorkin, the brains behind Sports Night (and not coincidentally the
writer of the feature film The American Presi dent), takes a stab
at the White House and draws comic blood. It's witty, if, like
Sports Night, a little talky at times. Well worth watching. Just
like Roswell. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   Get Real  &UR; _ The great thing about television: With two good
shows vying for your time at this hour already, you can skip this
family comedy/drama with Fox atti tude. (Which is to say that when
the moronic son's mom catches a girl spending the night with him,
after worrying a little, she invites her to stay for breakfast.
Kids _ they're so cute at that age.)
</P>
<P>
   Work With Me &UR; _ The worst chemistry since Dr. Jekyll was cooking
up experiments in his lab. Kevin Pollack is no Mr. Hyde _ usually
he's quite likable _ but he and Nancy Travis (usually likable, too)
just don't click as married lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Grow Up _ One roommate just found out he's gay (his wife was
as surprised as he was). Another is a womanizer who discovers he
has a teenage daughter. The third is a Struggling Artist. Oh, and
the dog talks (via subtitles). So why didn't I hate it? Because
somehow the characters are likable, especially Alan Basche as the
artist. Oddly enough, this might grow on you. &QL;

ROOKIE WILLIAMS SAYS G'DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the high-profile Los Angeles Dodgers starters
pitched this way in April and May, maybe the rookies would never
have had the September proving ground they stand upon now.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Australian lefty Jeff Williams was the third Dodgers
rookie to make his first career start in the past month. And
following the same pattern as Mike Judd and Eric Gagne, Williams
was impressive.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed two hits and an unearned run in five innings to win
his first major-league start, 9-4 against the San Francisco Giants
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 27, struck out one and walked three. The Giants' only
run scored when left fielder Gary Sheffield apparently lost Barry
Bonds' liner in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, with two innings of major-league experience, could
have melted there. Instead he didn't allow a runner past second
base after that. He retired seven straight at one point and 11 of
the last 13 batters he faced to defeat Giants' left-hander Kirk
Rueter (14-9).
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros gave the Dodgers a 3-1 lead in the first with his
33rd homer. Raul Mondesi added an RBI single in the third and then
smacked his career-high 31st homer in the seventh to give the
Dodgers a 9-4 lead. In each of the last two seasons, Mondesi hit 30
homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield also atoned for his miscue with his 28th homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson would
rather be getting Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes and Kevin Brown set
for the playoffs, not figuring out where Williams, Gagne or Judd
fit into the future. But he does have a certain fondness for
watching the inexperienced compete in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this time of year, giving young players an opportunity
to play,'' Johnson said. ``It's an exciting time for the young
players, to bring them up. It's also kind of an ice-breaking for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd allowed four earned runs in 61/3 innings in his first
major-league start, a win against the Montreal Expos on Aug. 12.
Judd made three more starts.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's outing was the most dominant, though he wasn't involved
in the decision against the Florida Marlins. He did, however,
strike out eight and allow two hits in six shutout innings. Gagne's
third start came in Monday's extra-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Williams gets another start could depend on the health
of right-hander Darren Dreifort, who's status won't be determined
until Thursday. He's bothered by tightness in his pitching
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the trio of Williams, Gagne and Judd has done is
give the Dodgers some measure of comfort if they decide to trade
one of their front-line starters in the offseason. Johnson said
either Judd or Gagne could be a fifth starter for the club next
season. Williams may find his name on that list after this start.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, signed as a nondrafted free agent out of Southeastern
Louisiana in 1996, piqued the Dodgers' interest during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was searching for left-handed help in the bullpen. Chris
Haney and Greg Cadaret were doing very little and Pedro Borbon and
rookie Onan Masaoka had yet to establish themselves. So they took a
look at Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's been in the Dodgers' plans, though it's
debatable whether he'll project out to a starter or reliever. After
spending his first two years in the organization as a starter,
Williams began this year in the bullpen for Triple-A Albuquerque
before moving to the starting rotation in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 5-3 as a reliever with the Dukes and 4-4 as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Dodgers like about Gagne is his ability to toughen
up in adverse situations and battle out of innings. Williams showed
that in the minor leagues by limiting the two-out, run-scoring
hits. Opponents batted .217 with runners on base and two outs
against him.

ORTIZ REGAINS HIS FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ramon Ortiz has been experiencing his share of
growing pains, the Anaheim Angels' pitching phenom enduring his
knocks in his previous four starts entering Tuesday's game against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz, a hard-throwing right-hander from the Dominican
Republic, on Tuesday regained some of the flash that made the
Angels so optimistic about his future.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, though, also showed some of the inconsistency that is
common for a 23-year-old rookie who began the season in Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz went five-plus innings, allowing three runs and four hits
while striking out five and walking four as the Angels won a 7-5
decision before 16,486 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz began the game by throwing seven consecutive pitches out
of the strike zone. Devil Rays leadoff hitter Miguel Cairo walked,
went to second on a wild pitch and scored on Dave Martinez's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz responded by retiring the next 13 consecutive hitters.
With one out in the fifth, Jose Guillen broke the string with a
single, but Ortiz struck out Bubba Trammell for the second out of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, though, then walked Tony Graffanino and Cairo to load the
bases before giving up a two-run single to Martinez. Ortiz escaped
further damage by striking out Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``More consistency within the strike zone and utilization of all
his pitches. Those are the two main things,'' Angels interim
manager Joe Maddon said before the game, when asked what he's
looking for from Ortiz. ``He's been out of the zone with has
fastball, and his breaking ball has not been as good as we'd like
to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz got some help early from the Angels offense, which was a
change. The Angels had scored only one run in his previous two
starts combined, which includes the no-hitter by the Twins' Eric
Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Angels got a two-out, two-run single by Andy Sheets
in the second inning, and run-scoring hits by Tim Salmon (single)
and Troy Glaus (double) in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz took a 4-3 lead into the sixth, but gave up a leadoff
double to Fred McGriff, then walked John Flaherty and was yanked.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina's two-run homer in the sixth inning _ his first
homer since June 24, 1998, off the Dodgers' Darren Dreifort _ gave
the Angels a 6-3 lead, but the Devil Rays got the two runs back in
the seventh on McGriff's two-run single.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- There are 93 shopping days until Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   If that fact sends chills up your spine, you must be a parent
who has tried _ and probably failed _ to get the toy in each of the
past few holiday seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Silver, not only a veteran toy tracker but also a father of
three, has set out to ease the pain for parents and children
through publication of the Toy Wishes catalog with reviews of more
than 1,000 toys. More importantly, Silver has singled out the Hot
Dozen that will disappear fastest from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has hung around children will recognize most names on
the list: Barbie, Buzz Lightyear, Elmo, Furbys, ``Star Wars,'' WCW,
WWF and Pokemon. Silver predicts two others, Amazing Amy and the
Intel Play QX3 Computer Microscope, could reach blockbuster status.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the pair of Pokemon entries, a plush toy and a new
set of cards, everything on the list uses computer electronics.
``Kids are growing up a lot faster these days, and they expect
more,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   American parents will spend nearly $20 billion on toys during
the next three months, Silver estimates. He said his goal is a
simple one: ``to help them better spend their money so their kids
say `cool' when they open their gifts.''

IN BOULDER, RICK-BASHING HITS ITS STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Bent and pointing as he coaches on the Colorado
sidelines, Rick Neuheisel is screaming toward the field in the
5-foot-high black-and-white photo that is mounted next to a huge TV
screen above the back bar in one of this burg's largest sports
bistros, the Lazy Dog.
</P>
<P>
   But the photo has been modified with a hand-crafted cartoon
bubble emerging from his mouth. The four sentences say:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no loyalty!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't coach!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be bought!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loser!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is about as tidy a summary as one will find of the
feelings held by many Buffalo fans here toward their former coach,
who in January took the money and ran to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if those same words were pasted on a photo of Gary
Barnett and hung in a Chicago sports bar, many Northwestern fans
would hoist a glass in a sarcastic toast to the sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett is in Colorado now, succeeding Neuheisel. So he is now
officially ordained a hero. At least, until he takes the money and
runs. Or gets fired.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of town, the Pearl Street nightlife strip, Jim
Cunningham is nursing a beer and a resentment toward Neuheisel, who
in four years here won a highly respectable 33 games but apparently
fewer fans. Cunningham is an engineer with a master's degree from
CU and knowledgeable about the seamier aspects of big-time sports.
But talk of Neuheisel short-cuts his brain and gets him in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be watching that game Saturday with drool coming out of
our mouths,'' he said of the Colorado-Washington match at Husky
Stadium. ``That cheesy little blond -------.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it often is with Neuheisel, among the most
provocative figures in college football. His same actions, or
inactions, done by another coach would draw scant notice. But
because he is so well-rewarded so young, and is so unlike the
traditional portrait of a college football coach, the condemnations
for his deviations are endless and visceral.
</P>
<P>
   Before Colorado's game with Kansas last week, Barnett showed up
to a team meeting in combat fatigues armed with a clip from the
movie ``Patton'' and a bunch of sophomoric rhetoric about war.
(Personal aside: If elected King of the Sports World, my first act
will be to line up in long rows every jock, coach and fan who uses
war analogies in sports and slap these folks, Three Stooges-style,
until they are too swollen to speak.)
</P>
<P>
   If Neuheisel had pulled that stunt, here or at Washington, he
would have been hooted into resignation. But Barnett drew only
chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel probably will be stuck with a bull's eye until he gets
fat and bald, wears sansabelt slacks and uses ``dad-gummit''
instead of complete sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that Neuheisel is an innocent victim of
superficial judgments. His game-coaching mistakes, along with his
friendlier treatment of players and glib Eddie Haskell-ish style,
have compromised him, burning up credibility with some fans more
quickly than a conventional coach.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the tavern, Cunningham was explaining that the bar of
professional standards is a little different for a football coach.
He accepts Neuheisel's defense that most any worker in any job
would have leapt at the kind of pay and prestige improvements
Neuheisel was offered at Washington. Still ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to think that there are some people in the world who
feel some things are bigger than money, even if you don't,'' he
said. ``When you see Rick on the street, he's very approachable,
the kind of regular guy you can go up to and say, `How's it going?'
Then when he goes for the money, after saying he was staying here,
you wonder what to believe; you wonder what example he's setting
for his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we don't expect college coaches to go for the lowest
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be no greater repository of naivete than the fans of
big-time college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Lazy Dog, the bar crowd was full of the usual
Rick-bashing, but one customer offered a similar theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he made the move, it said he cared more about himself
than CU,'' said David, a liquor store manager. ``I would have gone
for the money, too, but you want a leader to be better than you.
That football coach is in charge of a lot of young people, and you
hope he shows them something more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people here by now have accepted what happened. But
they don't have to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels so alienated. A popular Pearl Street
restaurant called Pasta Jay's is a hangout for Colorado coaches and
players. The owner, Jay Elowsky, is a big Buffs booster who is a
game-day sideline volunteer and occasionally runs spaghetti to
coaches working late in the video room.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my circle, I hear people say how much they miss him; I know
I do,'' said Elowsky, who is flying to Seattle today for the game
and a little vacation. ``I don't feel betrayed. I think people need
to understand that as long as Rick was here, he was under the
shadow of Bill McCartney (Neuheisel's predecessor who won the 1990
national title). Besides the money at Washington, Rick saw a good
opportunity to put his own print on a program. That's a big
challenge, but very seductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the restaurant business from my uncle, working eight
years for him. When I left to start this place 11 years ago, my
uncle felt betrayed. But he knew that I had to go on my own,
because doing it yourself is very alluring.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy isn't perfect _ the football coaching business gets
customers a little more worked up than the restaurant business.
Fans take their teams, and the rejection of their teams, much more
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, most college fans don't recognize their passion is
just another business. They vainly believe the college game is
something more and better.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Washington and Colorado last winter, and the
schools' coincidental convergence on the field this Saturday, helps
put a little honest light on remarks from any coach who says he
bleeds purple and gold, or black and gold.
</P>
<P>
   There is one color, green, and as long as everyone understands
that, the Lazy Dog can fill its space above the back bar with a
photo of Barnett dressed in combat fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Darts, anyone?

VETERAN SAYS NHL IS ONLY OPTION

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Len Barrie, a 30-year-old journeyman center
who spent the past 1{ seasons playing in Germany, isn't down to his
last chance in the NHL, according to Kings coach Andy Murray.
Barrie, however, begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make it and be successful this year, it would be
difficult to go back to Europe,'' said Barrie, who signed a
free-agent contract with the Kings in July. ``You either go over
there and get fat and finish up your career or you get in shape,
come back here and resume your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie, who once scored 116 points in the IHL, is getting some
long looks with his strong play during training camp, and the knee
injury that is expected to sideline another offensive-minded
center, Jason Blake, for at least another three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie scored an unassisted goal Monday against the Ducks, his
second in three games, and he'll again center the second line with
Donald Audette and Glen Murray when the Kings play San Jose in an
exhibition game tonight in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   __ Norstrom, Taylor meet: In an effort to come to terms with
unsigned All-Star defenseman Mattias Norstrom, a restricted free
agent, Kings Senior Vice President/General Manager Dave Taylor had
lunch Monday with Norstrom in an effort to assure him that he's a
large part of the Kings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom, who earned $950,000 last season, wondered earlier this
week if the Kings respected his ability after his offer of a
one-year, $1.3 million deal down from his initial asking price of
three years, $1.7 million each was rejected by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   He was seeking a three-year package at $1.7 million each. The
Kings are reportedly offering a three-year deal that averages just
over $1.2 million per year or a one-year, $1.045 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read (Norstrom's comments) and the first thing I told him
was we absolutely respect him as a player,'' Taylor said. ``We
value him as an important part of our club and view him as a second
defenseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are waiting to hear if rookie Finnish defenseman Jere
Karalahti, who was once arrested for heroin possession, will be
granted a visa.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last licks? The Kings were quick to brush aside Monday's
messy third-period free-for-alls, which left Anaheim's Teemu
Selanne and the Kings' Jason Podollan with stitches. Murray and
Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg also nearly came to blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different in the season because we won't be
able to take cheap penalties,'' Ian Laperriere said. ``We won't be
able to go crazy like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who think otherwise, the teams play again Dec. 3 at
the Pond.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernestine Schlant grew up in the Bavarian city of
Passau, where the Jews had all disappeared by the time she was 7
and one did not speak of the forced labor camp down the road. Her
father was in the Luftwaffe _ although not, she says, in the Nazi
party _ at the same time that she was bringing tea to the wounded
German soldiers whose hospital had taken over her school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like an angry retort half a century later, Dr. Schlant has
published ``The Language of Silence,'' a criticism of liberal
German writers like Guenter Grass and Heinrich Boell for what she
sees as their failure to come to terms with the Holocaust. It is,
of course, a personal text, too: ``I would not say that I feel
guilty,'' Dr. Schlant said Tuesday over coffee in midtown, ``but I
would say that I feel there is a legacy that is, well, a great
burden. This is my document, my attempt to really work it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is striking enough. But Dr. Schlant is also Mrs.
Bill Bradley, wife of the former senator and Knicks star who is
running for president. Even in the era of Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Dr. Schlant is an unusual political spouse. Probably she beat the
first lady at not baking cookies. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, Dr.
Schlant is unknown in political circles, and never moved to
Washington while Bradley was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The New Republic gave Dr. Schlant's book a
4,000-word review, calling it a ``vigorous, comprehensive and
troubling'' challenge to the conventional wisdom, without ever
mentioning who her husband is.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is changing. For the first time in her career as a
professor of German and comparative literature at Montclair State
University, Dr. Schlant has taken a leave to campaign full time for
her husband. ``The awesomeness of the office is such,'' she said,
``that I couldn't possibly say, `Well, that's for you, Bill, I have
other things to do.' I couldn't see how I could possibly live with
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it is the right moment for her. At 64, she has written
five books, raised two daughters (one is from an earlier marriage)
and survived breast cancer and a 1992 mastectomy. She has the
spirit of someone who is living on extra time. ``Whenever I speak
with breast cancer survivors, we all agree that life after cancer
is better than it was before,'' she said. ``We know more where our
values are. It's much more streamlined.''
</P>
<P>
   So here she is, on a sodden Tuesday morning, parked in the lobby
of the Millennium Hotel in midtown Manhattan, en route to Fox News
and then to Boston, not at all unhappy. ``Let me tell you, it's
fun, it's really fun,'' Dr. Schlant said, of the campaign. ``It's
great. Maybe it's a little like teaching. I can speak on a subject
I know, and I can speak to my heart's content. The subject being
Bill, it's not a chore at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At this fresh date, Dr. Schlant is still a compelling
combination of intellectual sophistication and seeming
guilelessness, eager to talk about why she feels Grass falls short
of ``really doing justice to the Holocaust'' in ``The Tin Drum,''
then just as eager to answer questions about how she met Bradley.
(It's a good story: She was assigned by the New York film company
she was working for in 1970 to line up the Knicks star to interview
poet and sports fan Marianne Moore. She had never heard of him, or
the Knicks, even though she lived in Bradley's building, but
immediately found him ``adorable.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, fell for a woman who, as she puts it,
-``hadn't been lassoed into the myth of Bill Bradley,'' and also
one, to judge from pictures at the time, who looked like a cerebral
Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Schlant first came to America in 1957, as a stewardess with Pan
Am, then went to Emory University in Atlanta, where her
undergraduate adviser, Walter Strauss, was the first of many Jews
she met who opened her eyes to what had really happened in Germany.
``He was like a midwife to my realization of the enormity of the
Holocaust,'' Dr. Schlant said. ``So I came to this tremendously
upsetting reality of the Holocaust, almost being held and comforted
by Jews here.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject would come up, ``almost like the second or third
sentence in a conversation,'' she said, as soon as a Jewish
acquaintance learned she had grown up in Germany. (She is now an
American citizen.) ``It would be almost like a bond,'' Dr. Schlant
said. ``Although we would be on totally different sides of the
fence, we would know immediately what we were speaking about.'' Dr.
Schlant added that she likes to think she would have written her
book if she had remained in Germany, ``but of course I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she sees herself as just another supporter working for her
husband _ ``My value to the campaign, and my self-image, is that
I'm not trying to be a political wife'' _ who happens to know him
better than anyone else. Her cancer, she added, ``made both of us
discover depths in our relationship that we never knew were
there.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We had a wonderful marriage before, but it was not
put through the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schlant, who uses Ernestine Bradley on the campaign trail,
was about to say that her husband had always supported her career
and other such niceties. There was a time, for example, when
Bradley raised their daughter, then 10, in Washington, and Dr.
Schlant flew down for long weekends. But she was able to rescue
herself from political spouse-speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use the word `support,''' she said, ``because
it's condescending.''

COUNTRYWIDE EXCEEDS ANALYSTS' HOPES AGAIN

<P>
   CALABASAS _ Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., which has
enjoyed almost four years of record earnings, announced that second
quarter earnings once again exceeded Wall Street expectations,
leading one analyst to describe the company's results as ``pretty
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide's better-than-expected earnings sent the company's
share price up $1.25, or 4.15 percent, Tuesday to $31.5625 per
share. However, the company's stock price remains nearly 40 percent
lower than its 52-week high of $51.4375 set in January.
</P>
<P>
   The residential finance company based in Calabasas, 28 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, reported unaudited net earnings for the
second quarter ended Aug. 31 were $106.5 million, a 12 percent
increase over earnings of $95.1 million for the same quarter in
1998. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were 91
cents, up from 81 cents for the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected earnings of 88 cents a share, said Gary
Gordon, a managing director with Paine Webber in New York. Gordon
said he was impressed with the company's second quarter results,
but cautioned that increased price competition within the home loan
industry would make the next two quarters ``very challenging'' for
Countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo R. Mozilo, Countrywide's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement that the company has produced record
results despite rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Servicing earnings growth more than offset the decline in
production earnings which resulted from lower volume,'' Mozilo said
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its loan service portfolio grew to $236 billion
with a weighted average coupon of 7.4 percent at Aug. 31 from $195
billion with a weighted average coupon of 7.7 percent at the end of
the second quarter last year.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The day after the Los Angeles Kings and
Anaheim Mighty Ducks combined for 149 penalty minutes in a 8-1 Los
Angeles victory, the Ducks admitted they were embarrassed and
hopefully a little wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we (learned a lesson), said Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg after Tuesday's practice. ``You just had to look up at
the scoreboard ... we know we were embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good thing (getting routed), but once in a while it
brings what's important back into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Aki Berg's check on Teemu Selanne seemed to get the bad bood
flowing, but Selanne, who picked up four stitches when his visor
cut his lip, said it appeared worse than it was and that ``I think
it was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who said the play began when fell down after stepping
on a stick, even joked that Berg, as a fellow Finn, ``would be
scared to touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Ducks played was no joke to Selanne, who said
the Anaheim players held a players-only meeting after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst we've skated all year, he said. ``They (the
Kings) were excited, it being the last game at the Forum, and we
were a step behind all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously embarrassing. We got frustrated and that's
why all the fights started.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Kariya out: &UR; !off! &LR;  Paul Kariya did not practice with the
team and said he remains on a day-to-day basis with his left-quad
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim captain continues to work on strengthing his leg in
off-ice workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gone on the ice before I had proper strength and when I
make a quick move I blow it out again,'' said Kariya. ``I just have
to get the strength back. The last couple of days it's a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya took part in several practices last week but said while
he could get away with practicing at less than full speed he was
not ready for game conditions.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!To AHL: &UR; !off! &LR;  In somewhat of a surprising move, the
Ducks assigned second-year forward Johan Davidsson to Cincinnati of
the Amrican Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Davidsson was a regular much of last season, scoring 3 goals and
8 points in 64 games while filling mostly a checking role for
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Mike Leclerc's strong traing camp showing and the ability
of Pascal Trepanier to play both forward and defense might have
made Davidsson expendable for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are carrying 28 players and will likely reduce their
roster to 22 or 23 by opening night.

ROOKIE WILLIAMS SAYS G'DAY
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the high-profile Los Angeles Dodgers starters
pitched this way in April and May, the rookies never would have
gotten the September proving ground on which they stand now.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, everyone knows what type of season Chan Ho Park and
Carlos Perez had, which brings us to Australian left-hander Jeff
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third Dodgers rookie to start since the trading
deadline, and Tuesday night his pattern was consistent with
youngsters Mike Judd and Eric Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   Williams allowed two hits and an unearned run in five innings to
win his first major-league start, a 9-4 victory against the San
Francisco Giants in front of 31,881 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty good, indeed,'' Williams said. ``Better than I
ever hoped for. This is what you dream for, from college baseball
to the minor leagues to pitching here. This is what you dream
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 27, struck out one and walked three. The Giants' only
run scored when left fielder Gary Sheffield apparently lost Barry
Bonds' liner in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, with two innings of major-league experience, could
have melted there. Instead he didn't allow another runner past
second. He retired seven straight at one point and 11 of the last
13 batters he faced to beat Giants left-hander Kirk Rueter (14-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't intimidated when he came up and pitched toward the
end of spring training and faced Mo Vaughn in Anaheim,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's definitely in the mix of guys
that can give us insurance in the starting ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was aided by four Dodgers homers. Raul Mondesi,
Sheffield and Paul LoDuca each went deep, but it was Eric Karros'
three-run homer in the first that gave Williams a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is what this team was built around,'' Karros said.
``It was a focal point and I'm not sure it lived up to everything
said about it. Does this mean (Williams) will be in the rotation
next season? No, but in spring training, it means he'll get a
longer look. Those guys that do well now, it kind of adds to your
resume.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' file on starting pitching throughout the
organization certainly isn't filled with many can't-miss prospects.
But since heading west from Dodgertown 151 games ago, a few names
were added.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Judd, who allowed four earned runs in 61/3 innings
in his first major-league start, a win at Montreal on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's outing was the most dominant, although he wasn't
involved in the decision against the Florida Marlins. He did,
however, strike out eight and allow two hits in six shutout
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Williams gets another start could depend on the health
of right-hander Darren Dreifort, whose status won't be determined
until Thursday. He's bothered by tightness in his pitching
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dreifort,'' Johnson said with a smile, `` `Dreifort
who?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Williams needs to work on a change-up and curveball
but added he was impressed with the rookie's mettle and the
location on the fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little deliberate to the plate,'' Johnson said.
``He's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, signed as a nondrafted free agent out of Southeastern
Louisiana in 1996, piqued the Dodgers' interest during spring
training. The Dodgers were searching for left-handed help in the
bullpen and nobody established themselves. So they took a look at
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been in the Dodgers' plans. After spending
his first two years in the organization as a starter, Williams
began this season in the bullpen for Triple-A Albuquerque before
moving to the rotation in midseason. Williams was 5-3 with a 4.73
ERA in relief with the Dukes. He was 4-4 with a 5.18 ERA as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of him,'' said LoDuca, who caught Williams in the
minors. ``He had an awesome sinker, to the point where I was
sitting in the middle of the plate and just letting him throw it.''

GARCIA WINS 16TH AS GRIFFEY, RODRIGUEZ LEAD HR BARRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was Royals against royalty, Kansas City against the
crown prince of Caracas. The electoral process won.
</P>
<P>
   Stumping hard for AL Rookie of the Year honors, Freddy Garcia
swung a few more votes his way Tuesday night, the Mariners'
first-year pitcher turning in another persuasive performance. The
right-hander went five innings and posted his 16th victory in 24
decisions as the Mariners took a 13-3 decision before 34,179 fans
at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a rookie who comes around very often and wins
16 games,'' Mariners catcher Tom Lampkin said. ``He's putting his
two cents in.''
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia was busy adding to his season-long list of first
impressions, teammates Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez _ proven
superstars yet neither one a rookie of the year selectee _
continued to chase ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Giving his club a 2-0 lead in the first, Griffey socked his 47th
homer, and 397th of his career. That left him alone at 32nd on the
all-time long-ball ladder, breaking a tie with Joe Carter. Griffey
also had a run-scoring single in the fourth, raising his RBI total
to 130.
</P>
<P>
   His slump a thing of the past, Rodriguez launched his 40th and
41st homers, making him the first AL shortstop to top the 40 mark
twice, and only the second big league shortstop to do so. Ernie
Banks pulled this feat five times for the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud of that accomplishment, particularly after
missing six weeks,'' Rodriguez said. ``It's special, no doubt about
it. But I wish I was doing it for a team in a pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Blowers and Lampkin also homered, while Edgar Martinez
collected four hits, the latter a season high and raising his
average to .346.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiary of all this offense was Garcia, who wasn't his
usual efficient self against Kansas City. But that's what was
impressive _ he still got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we hit good tonight,'' Garcia said. ``I tried to make
good pitches, but my balls had no movement. I try to be too fine.
(I'll) take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lampkin, ``There's times when Freddy pitched well and
hadn't gotten the win or the decision, so this was good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   With 16 victories, Garcia became the winningest Venezuelan
pitcher in the big leagues, surpassing countrymen Wilson Alvarez
and Omar Daal, both registering 15.
</P>
<P>
   With possibly two starts left, the Mariners' first-year player
has a chance to break the club record for rookie pitching victories
_ 17, now shared by Mark Langston (1984) and Dave Fleming (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Garcia had to gut this one out. He was working on just four days
rest, and it showed. He threw three wild pitches to tie a club
record. He walked four batters. He had no changeup. Yet he made the
big pitch whenever he needed it, escaping jams in the third, fourth
and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   He even needed four outs to get out of the first inning,
striking out his third batter, Carlos Beltran, but putting him on
with his first wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Larboring, Garcia finally gave way to reliever Frankie Rodriguez
after throwing 107 pitches through his five frames. Garcia
permitted seven hits, one to Beltran, probably his strongest
competition for the AL rookie honor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for his input on the award, Mariners manager Lou
Piniella seemed torn between his pitcher and Beltran, a Royals
center fielder who went 3-for-5, 1-for-3 against Garcia, to raise
his average to .295.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid in Kansas City, how can you not look his way? He's a
heckuva outfielder,'' the Mariners manager said, listing Beltran's
stats, which include 22 homers and 104 RBIs. ``But you look
(Garcia's) way, too. Sixteen wins should make him rookie pitcher of
the year (sic). When you look at the young talent that's surfaced
around the league, it's as good as it's been in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lampkin, ``Carlos Beltran is definitely showing why he has
a shot to be rookie of the year. But you don't have a rookie very
often who comes around and wins 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said if he doesn't receive the award, his Kansas City
counterpart will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beltran, he's so good,'' the pitcher said. ``He can do
everything. He's one of the superstars. We'll see what happens
after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad campaign strategy for Garcia. Take the humble
approach. Set up the hitter. Praise the opponent. Then steal the
award from him.

HUSAK OFF TO FAST START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The three-game totals that Todd Husak has
put together this season fit nicely into the profile of a Stanford
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He's completed 53 passes in 108 attempts for 784 yards with five
touchdowns and one interception. But, before you talk about the
individual passing numbers, Husak wants to discuss some other
reasons the Cardinal has generated 104 points in the past two
games.
</P>
<P>
   He would first like to talk about an offensive line that is
doing a better job of keeping his uniform clean and a running
attack that has been stimulated by the emergence of running back
Kerry Carter, a freshman from Canada, whose senior season never got
underway because of a teacher's strike. Or he'll tell you about a
defense which, at least in the last two games, has created
wonderful field position for the Stanford offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is working for us,'' said Husak, a 6-foot-3,
210-pound senior, who is a native of Long Beach and St. John Bosco
High graduate. ``When everything works, putting up 50 is a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And when everything doesn't, then 69-17 becomes all too
possible. It was by that 69-17 margin that Stanford lost its opener
on a sweltering Sept. 4 at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly cannot explain what happened,'' said Husak of the
miserable outing against the Longhorns. ``Going in, we were
confident. We thought we would give those guys a game and maybe
walk out with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, the Longhorns led, 48-10, and after 60 minutes
the Stanford players were trying to figure out what went wrong in
the school's most lopsided defeat since dropping a 67-0 decision to
Cal in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we decided `Hey this season is not like last
season','' Husak said of the 3-8 squad in 1998. ``This team is a
lot different than last year's team. Nothing against those
(seniors), but this year's seniors are playing with a sense of
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency turned into two big games for Husak in a 54-17
victory over Washington State and a 50-22 triumph at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has really sharpened up game and taken it to the next
level,'' Cardinal coach Tyrone Willingham said. `` He's been
excellent at the physical job of throwing the football and also the
mental demands of getting the team in the right offense at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing that against Washington State does little to change public
opinion of the Cardinal, but decisively beating an Arizona that
began the season ranked in the national top five should open some
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people will just think Arizona was overated,''
said Husak, who was 21 of 35 for 364 yards against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Another chance to prove they are a good team will come Saturday
when the Cardinal welcomes defending Pac-10 champion UCLA to Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Husak threw for 419 yards and a touchdown in a 28-24
loss to the Bruins at the Rose Bowl. It was the third best passing
yardage total in Stanford history, but Husak and his teammates will
remember the day for the disappointment of seeing receiver Jeff
Allen being stripped by UCLA defensive back Marques Anderson a yard
short of what could have been the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close doesn't count,'' said Husak, who holds the school's top
single-game with his 450 compiled in a loss to Oregon State. ``You
can pick a couple of (tough losses) last year. Arizona State was a
heartbreaker. UCLA was a heartbreaker. But, yeah, maybe (the story
of) last season can be wrapped up in one play.''
</P>
<P>
   Husak hopes it will be nine games which would include a bowl
game to wrap up a Stanford career that began in relative anonymity.
His only year as a full-time starter at St. John Bosco was as a
senior and Stanford was pretty much his lone option.
</P>
<P>
   Which probably made it easier to step into a Stanford
quarterback tradition which includes All-Americans John Elway,
Frankie Albert, Guy Benjamin, Mike Boryla, John Brodie and 1970
Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel any pressure from it because nobody expected
much from me,'' Husak said. ``It was more like `You're no John
Elway'.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's done, though, Husak's name will be prominent in the
school's record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly a guy that as you watch him, he just gets better
and better,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Husak is currently seventh on the Stanford career passing yards
list and is eighth in total offense. The 3,092 he compiled last
year on 233 completions in 447 attempts marked only the third time
in school history that a quarterback has eclipsed the 3,000-yard
mark.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers aren't the ones that are important right now.
He wants to do what Chad Hutchinson did in 1996, which is lead the
team to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   And, there something about the last two games that has Husak
believing the Cardinal are going to be busy for the holidays for
the first time since beating Michigan State, 38-0, in the 1996 Sun
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are real similiar mentally to my freshman year
when we started 2-5 and won our last five games,'' Husak said.
``Those guys just believed we were going to win and we did. I think
that's how this team is handling themselves now. We just need to
keep that going.''

IBSEN IN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif.  &UR; _ &LR;  Zak Ibsen has gone from the low man on the
depth chart to a fixture in the Los Angeles Galaxy's starting
lineup. All it took was for Ibsen to gain control of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen, 27, has played in 21 of 27 games this season and had
started five straight before a recent case of the flu forced him
back to the bench. He returned to action last week against Colorado
in a substitute role.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen has learned to appreciate his time in the starting lineup,
and he hopes to see more action when the Galaxy plays host to rival
Washington D.C. United Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Reared as a soccer prodigy, Ibsen received wide acclaim as a
youngster, playing for several U.S. national youth teams. But he
nearly self-destructed before his career really began.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen left Dallas after the 1996 inaugural Major League Soccer
season to play beach soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas wanted us to get in an off-season program, but I
thought I could make more money playing beach soccer,'' he said.
``That was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen missed the entire 1997 season and had to convince Chicago
coach Bob Bradley his commitment was genuine again. Bradley
acquired Ibsen from Dallas, figuring he had nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen made the most of his opportunity as a substitute, helping
the Fire defeat the Galaxy in the MLS playoffs before capturing the
MLS Cup and U.S. Cup titles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ibsen wasn't happy with his surroundings. He wanted to
return to Southern California with his wife and finish his degree
at UCLA, where from 1990-94 he spent time both as one of coach Sigi
Schmid's favorite and least favorite players.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Ibsen was traded to the Galaxy for nothing
more than a second-round college draft pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm forever in debt to Bob Bradley for trading me to L.A. for
such a low value,'' said Ibsen. ``I know I wasn't a need for
Octavio (Zambrano, former Galaxy coach). I came to Octavio and said
`I want to be here,' and he gave up as little as he could to get
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zambrano was fired in favor of Schmid, Ibsen wasn't sure
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigi and I definitely butted heads when I was at UCLA,'' said
Ibsen. ``It took a long time for us to sort of understand each
other, but we finally arrived at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen blames himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it was me being 18,'' he said. ``I was on the
National team and thought I was pretty hot stuff. But Sigi's a
great coach. All you have to do is see how many great players came
through UCLA during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen has started in place of Ezra Hendrickson at right back and
Roy Myers on occasions. He has made the most his opportunities.
Ibsen scored two goals in a 4-2 win over New York/New Jersey and
has helped the defense remain solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat quietly and patiently waiting my turn,'' said Ibsen.
``It seemed like (Schmid) went through just about everybody on the
team before he came to me. Everyone has their own motivation
factor. For me, I've accepted a lesser role than I thought I was
capable of for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat the bench the whole year in Chicago and most of this
season. Personally, I felt sitting on the bench and having a
back-seat role wasn't going to help this team win. I don't need to
start every game, but there's no reason judging by how I've played
that I can't help this team win. I'm all about winning
championships and will do whatever it takes. If we don't win, then
I will complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid has not been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zak is an experienced player and he's been part of a
championship team,'' said Schmid. ``I felt confident that when it
was his time to come in he would do well. With Zak, I'm not sure if
he'll start or keep coming off the bench, but he's proven to me how
valuable he is.''

GOP HOPEFUL FORBES TOUTS HIMSELF AS CONSERVATIVES' ALTERNATIVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Striving to establish himself as the genuine GOP
conservative in the 2000 presidential race, Steve Forbes said
Tuesday that he has formally challenged GOP front-runner George W.
Bush to a series of debates but that Bush has failed to respond to
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about several hours each. (I'll debate) anywhere
he wants,'' said Forbes on board his high-tech Victory Express I
bus to Sacramento at the start of a weeklong California tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, not only can voters see what you stand for, but get
a feel for whether you have the backbone, the compass, the
determination to make positive things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign, sensing opportunity with the possible
defection of Pat Buchanan from the GOP, has become increasingly
vocal in its suggestions that the Texas governor has failed to
outline his policy on key issues like abortion, taxes and
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``needs to get out and debate the issues, and let the
members of the party see where he stands,'' said John Herrington,
the former Secretary of Energy under Ronald Reagan and now state
chair of the Forbes campaign. ``He can't keep campaigning from an
ivory tower.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's campaign was quick to respond to those charges
Tuesday _ and the suggestion that the Texas governor is running
away from issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush looks forward to debating about all the issues
next year, when people are paying attention,'' said the governor's
spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, noting that Bush has agreed to attend a
January 15 debate in Iowa. She said that Forbes ``can continue to
watch as the governor lays out his policy initiatives this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she said, he will outline his plans ``to make sure
we have a strong national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Forbes _ facing Bush's strong lead in the polls
and his prodigious fund-raising strength _ is taking off the
gloves. He appeared feisty and relaxed Tuesday as he swung his way
across the Bay Area toward the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in Modesto, Calif., last night at a barbecue attended
by more 1,000 supporters. He will continue on to Fresno Wednesday
and Southern California tomorrow. Forbes will also deliver the
keynote address this weekend at the state Republican convention in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a Chronicle interview how his policies relate to those
of Bush, Forbes said, ``Just compare: I put a tax proposal on the
table. ... I put a real Social Security proposal on the table ...
not some vague, throwaway line (in speeches).''
</P>
<P>
   ``On education: He wants a bigger role for the federal
government,'' said Forbes. ``Mine is rooted in parents and
communities and schools. I trust parents, not politicians, on
education.''
</P>
<P>
   With six months to go before the March 2000 primary and still in
single digits in the polls, Forbes is convinced that conservative
Republicans uncomfortable with Bush's juggernaut _ and dismayed by
Buchanan's possible defection from the GOP _ will find a home with
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign notes that there have already been some
high-profile defections from other campaigns recently.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Charles Jarvis resigned his post as national campaign
chair for GOP conservative presidential hopeful Gary Bauer, calling
Forbes the best chance for conservatives to elect a president in
the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, two key South Carolina Buchanan supporters jumped to
Forbes' ship.
</P>
<P>
   And California GOP Assemblyman Thomas ``Rico'' Oller of San
Andreas announced he was ``the crack in the wall'' _ the first
state legislator the back Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is emerging as the responsible conservative alternative
to George Bush,'' said Steve Merksamer, a veteran GOP strategist
and Forbes campaign adviser. ``He's developing a lot of momentum in
the early primary states and here in California. He's a serious
candidate for serious conservatives.'`
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's possible move to the Reform Party ``underscores the
need for this party to have an inspired, principled, genuine
message,'' Forbes said. ``We had one in the '80s, and we won. The
last two elections we didn't, and we lost. No message, no
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes, a millionaire businessman, also has the luxury of
money for his latest California push. That was evident Tuesday at
the crack of dawn when his convoy, two super-equipped high-tech
buses dubbed Victory Express I and II, took off from Oakland to the
blaring sounds of Willie Nelson's ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also ample evidence of Forbes' tech-savvy interest in
the politics of the Internet. In what may be the most
technologically advanced presidential campaign on the road, a
campaign staff photographer documents each stop and immediately
downloads photos onto the candidate's Web site,
 &UR; www.forbes2000.com.  &LR;

 IS `SANDWICH GANG' FULL OF BOLOGNA?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's No. 1 problem is the homeless,
according to a Chronicle poll. And if you think it's a problem to
you, imagine what a bummer it is to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   If you polled them, the three top problems would probably be
homelessness, foodlessness and hopelessness. Muni would be well
down the list.
</P>
<P>
   The homeful, meanwhile, are sharply divided among those who
believe we're not helping the homeless enough and those who believe
we're helping too much.
</P>
<P>
   I know this after a recent column about a group of Marin County
high school students who come to the city every Saturday and hand
out 500 sandwiches to the homeless. The SFPD shut down the
operation two Saturdays ago. After much media attention, the P.D.
helped the kids get back into business.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau helped speed the students through the
permits jungle, because while it's technically not a crime to feed
the homeless, it does require more permits than opening a brothel
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people supported the students. If you've ever been a
parent and you caught your son or daughter handing out sandwiches
to poor people, your first thought was probably not:
 &UR; Oh, Lord, where have I gone wrong?  &LR; But a lot of readers said to
tell those bleeding-heart rich kids to take a ferry-boatload of the
S.F. homeless back to Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks said the sandwich gang was making the homeless
problem worse by making the city more attractive to the
down-and-out. And that's a debate-worthy point: that the better you
treat homeless people, the more of them there will be.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy answer, but here's a note sent by Travis Brooks,
a former San Franciscan who now lives in New Hampshire:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mugged in San Francisco. Eleven plates and 44 screws
later, I found myself with little sense of who I was or what I
could do. I lived in a hotel in the Tenderloin for I guess four
months, having to check my driver's license to tell someone my
name. ...
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of OSTLER22 (66341 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``What I remember most about being lost, when I couldn't even
remember my own name, are two things: One, the absolute fear of not
knowing who I was. Two, the beauty of the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture not knowing who you are or what you are worth, not
knowing if you are something at all, and being handed a couple of
sandwiches by someone who thinks you mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   TO BE HONEST with you, Doug Wilkins might be on to a new trend.
Which is a lot better than being on to an old trend.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed it first on sports radio station KNBR. The
announcers, Doug says, tend to begin any given statement with ``To
be honest with you,'' or ``I'll be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug asks, ``Does this reflect an exciting new trend to sporadic
honesty in sports gab?''
</P>
<P>
   I hope not, but Doug also noticed the honesty lead-in popping up
in other media, and in real life.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest with you, Doug, I think radio guys and others
simply got sick of the previous trend _ starting every statement
with ``I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   I mean, like, y'know?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (I hear you. _ Editor) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HIS CALCULATOR working overtime, Jim Corrigan came up with a
stat. The SFFD released its biannual overtime report to the Board
of Supes two weeks ago, and the report listed $10,076,000 in
overtime for fiscal year 1998-99. Jim did the math and says each
hour in San Francisco, city firefighters earn $1,153 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ADD SANDWICHES: The cop crackdown on the Marin Sandwich Gang,
several readers point out, was merely to protect the homeless
people from the germy kids.
</P>
<P>
   Health standards in food-handling should protect the homeless
too, they point out. Joseph F. Melanson notes, ``San Francisco has
one of the best health departments of any major city.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the slowest. It took 'em seven years to crack down on
this particular health menace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, why isn't the Health Dept. putting padlocks on
Dumpsters?
</P>
<P>
   CUTE COMMERCIAL on TV for AT&AMP;T directory assistance: A woman
phones 00 and tells the perky operator she's looking for a cab
driver named ``Pizzaria.''
</P>
<P>
   The operator checks her computer and deduces that the cabbie is
probably Pete Zorria.
</P>
<P>
   This disturbs alert reader Cary Hammer, because as the perky
operator locates Pete Zorria in her computer, there is a quick shot
of the operator's computer screen, which seems to contain an
extensive intelligence dossier on old Pete, including a large
photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is one supposed to assume,'' Hammer wonders, ``that this is to
aid operators faced with calls such as, `I met a girl at a party
last night and I was too drunk to remember her name, but she was
real pretty with dark hair kind of up in a bun. Can you find her,
please?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had my phone installed, I don't remember a photo shoot,
but perhaps there is a camera in the phone itself. Does the Freedom
of Information Act allow me to get my AT&AMP;T file and see what the
phone company thinks of me?''
</P>
<P>
   I'll save you the time, Cary. They don't like you anymore.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russians would be the first to admit their strange
national propensity for envying others their success, yet pitying
them in misfortune. That was how they treated Raisa Gorbachev, who
died of leukemia in a German hospital Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When she was the first Soviet President's glittering First Lady,
they detested her. When she fell ill, Russians gave her their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The news that she had succumbed to an infection before she could
receive a transplant of bone marrow from her sister was the first
item on the television news here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raisa Maximovna suffered very much in the past few weeks but
her death was peaceful,'' NTV's correspondent in Germany assured
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped to end the Cold War with his
policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness),
would bring his wife home to be buried in Moscow's Novodevichy
cemetery, he said. President Boris Yeltsin had sent his condolences
and promised a charter plane to fly the body to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Raisa Gorbachev's last weeks, not only did her
husband keep a vigil at the Muenster Clinic that tried to save her
but also the whole of Russia followed her saga, as if she were a
soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ordinary Russians sent letters, recipes for herbal
medicines and even offers of money to the couple they once reviled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way we are,'' said Olga Podolskaya, a
secretary. ``We used to find Raisa extremely irritating. But at the
end, we felt sorry for her and even more sorry for him, the loyal
and loving husband, constantly at her bedside.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Gorbachev herself knew how the Russian public felt about
her. In an interview for the TV show ``Hero With His Tie Off,''
recorded when she was well, she recounted how hard it had been to
be the first ever First Lady in a society that hid its political
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Russians almost never saw Viktoria, wife of the late Communist
leader, Leonid Brezhnev, and as for one of his successor's, Yuri
Andropov, they were not sure whether he had a wife at all.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa broke a taboo by appearing in public with her husband. For
him, admitting that he had a partner and that she played an
important role in his life was a personal act of glasnost, an
extension of his policy of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Like all pioneers, the Gorbachevs paid for being ahead of their
time. Raisa was a clever, educated woman, a species that many
Russians still have trouble in accepting. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was born Raisa Maximovna Titorenko in the Siberian region of
Altai in 1932. Her father, Maxim Titorenko, had gone out to Siberia
to help build the railways. The young Raisa was bright enough to go
all the way from this provincial backwater to Moscow State
University (MGU), where she studied philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There she met Mikhail, a promising law student, whom she married
in 1953. When he returned to his native Stavropol district in
southern Russia to become a local Communist Party boss, she joined
him and took up a career in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   When he was promoted to a party job in Moscow, in charge of
Soviet agriculture, she did research at her old philosophy faculty
at MGU. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her public appearances began soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985. Not only did she take on the chairmanship
of the Soviet Culture Fund but she also joined Gorbachev on his
domestic outings to meet the people and his numerous trips to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   She always wore an elegant dress or suit and a tasteful amount
of jewelry. That was her mistake. Russians were green with envy
because she had a measure of sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And not only Russians. It was said that Nancy Reagan could not
abide her either because on one occasion she showed her knowledge
of art while guiding the American First Lady around Moscow's famous
Tretyakov Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russians would have preferred Raisa Gorbachev to be
more homely. Naina Yeltsina, wife of President Yeltsin, has
cultivated an image of the little woman in the kitchen, probably
because of all the bile directed at Raisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I hated her too,'' said Ms. Podolskaya. ``I
remember once seeing her following Gorbachev on some agricultural
or industrial visit. She was trotting along behind him in
high-heeled shoes and I thought `why doesn't she just stay at
home?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I realize that I was jealous because she had
more dresses than the average Russian woman. She was trying to be a
real First Lady. But I think she was badly advised. Someone should
have told her to wear the same outfit more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her husband was out of power, Raisa avoided the limelight.
In 1996, she sold the extensive wardrobe that had attracted so much
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted her time to fund-raising for cancer care and
research. Before she knew she had leukemia herself, she was helping
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Russians came to love her and why many will shed
tears when Raisa flies home for the last time. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russians would be the first to admit their strange
national propensity for envying others their success, yet pitying
them in misfortune. That was how they treated Raisa Gorbachev, who
died of leukemia in a German hospital Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When she was the first Soviet President's glittering First Lady,
they detested her. When she fell ill, Russians gave her their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The news that she had succumbed to an infection before she could
receive a transplant of bone marrow from her sister was the first
item on the television news here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raisa Maximovna suffered very much in the past few weeks but
her death was peaceful,'' NTV's correspondent in Germany assured
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped to end the Cold War with his
policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness),
would bring his wife home to be buried in Moscow's Novodevichy
cemetery, he said. President Boris Yeltsin had sent his condolences
and promised a charter plane to fly the body to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Raisa Gorbachev's last weeks, not only did her
husband keep a vigil at the Muenster Clinic that tried to save her
but also the whole of Russia followed her saga, as if she were a
soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ordinary Russians sent letters, recipes for herbal
medicines and even offers of money to the couple they once reviled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way we are,'' said Olga Podolskaya, a
secretary. ``We used to find Raisa extremely irritating. But at the
end, we felt sorry for her and even more sorry for him, the loyal
and loving husband, constantly at her bedside.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Gorbachev herself knew how the Russian public felt about
her. In an interview for the TV show ``Hero With His Tie Off,''
recorded when she was well, she recounted how hard it had been to
be the first ever First Lady in a society that hid its political
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Russians almost never saw Viktoria, wife of the late Communist
leader, Leonid Brezhnev, and as for one of his successor's, Yuri
Andropov, they were not sure whether he had a wife at all.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa broke a taboo by appearing in public with her husband. For
him, admitting that he had a partner and that she played an
important role in his life was a personal act of glasnost, an
extension of his policy of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Like all pioneers, the Gorbachevs paid for being ahead of their
time. Raisa was a clever, educated woman, a species that many
Russians still have trouble in accepting. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was born Raisa Maximovna Titorenko in the Siberian region of
Altai in 1932. Her father, Maxim Titorenko, had gone out to Siberia
to help build the railways. The young Raisa was bright enough to go
all the way from this provincial backwater to Moscow State
University (MGU), where she studied philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There she met Mikhail, a promising law student, whom she married
in 1953. When he returned to his native Stavropol district in
southern Russia to become a local Communist Party boss, she joined
him and took up a career in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   When he was promoted to a party job in Moscow, in charge of
Soviet agriculture, she did research at her old philosophy faculty
at MGU. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her public appearances began soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985. Not only did she take on the chairmanship
of the Soviet Culture Fund but she also joined Gorbachev on his
domestic outings to meet the people and his numerous trips to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   She always wore an elegant dress or suit and a tasteful amount
of jewelry. That was her mistake. Russians were green with envy
because she had a measure of sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And not only Russians. It was said that Nancy Reagan could not
abide her either because on one occasion she showed her knowledge
of art while guiding the American First Lady around Moscow's famous
Tretyakov Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russians would have preferred Raisa Gorbachev to be
more homely. Naina Yeltsina, wife of President Yeltsin, has
cultivated an image of the little woman in the kitchen, probably
because of all the bile directed at Raisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I hated her too,'' said Ms. Podolskaya. ``I
remember once seeing her following Gorbachev on some agricultural
or industrial visit. She was trotting along behind him in
high-heeled shoes and I thought `why doesn't she just stay at
home?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I realize that I was jealous because she had
more dresses than the average Russian woman. She was trying to be a
real First Lady. But I think she was badly advised. Someone should
have told her to wear the same outfit more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her husband was out of power, Raisa avoided the limelight.
In 1996, she sold the extensive wardrobe that had attracted so much
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted her time to fund-raising for cancer care and
research. Before she knew she had leukemia herself, she was helping
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Russians came to love her and why many will shed
tears when Raisa flies home for the last time. &QL;

<P>
   Is this the year of the earthquake? After the devastating quakes
in Turkey and then Greece in two months, one might think the
latest, its epicenter less than 100 miles from the capital of
Taiwan, marks a worrying trend.
</P>
<P>
   But geologists say there is no direct connection between the
three disasters; they are simply part of the continual commotion in
the Earth's crust, as the massive tectonic plates floating on the
molten mantle _ the continents and the ocean floors _ move and
grind into each other, sometimes sliding under or over.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the latest quake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter
scale, is not unusual. There are scores above magnitude 7.0 every
year, and four or five above 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   But most happen far from population centers, and deep
underground. The one in Taiwan is devastating because it is
comparatively near the surface, only 33 km (20 miles) down, rather
than 600 km, as is more common in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem there are more earthquakes,'' said Alice Walker
of the British Geological Survey. ``But last year there were two
big ones _ the first in Afghanistan which killed 4,000 people, and
one which caused a tidal wave that killed 6,000 people in Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that the latest ones have happened in the past two
months; and Turkey and Greece are vacation destinations, which
makes people here more interested in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan lies where the edge of the (comparatively small)
Philippine plate abuts the larger Eurasian plate, which contains a
huge expanse including the United Kingdom, Europe, Russia and
China. Slowly, the Philippine plate is being forced under the
Eurasian plate.
</P>
<P>
   The last large tremor to hit the island, on Nov. 14, 1986,
measured 7.5, but it happened hundreds of miles out to sea. The
death toll was 15. &QL;

<P>
   Why is there a little bit of East Timor surrounded by West
Timor?
</P>
<P>
   The small triangle of land, folded into the north coast of
Indonesian West Timor, is the enclave of Oecussi, and its continued
existence as part of East Timor is the result of a historical
accident.
</P>
<P>
   When Portuguese and Dutch traders first visited the island of
Timor in the early sixteenth century, they had separate spheres of
influence. The situation became even more complicated with the rise
of the Topasses, a class of mixed blood Portuguese-Timorese who
seized control of much of the island, often at the expense of the
Portuguese themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1701, a governor newly arrived from Lisbon was forced by the
Topasses to relocate his capital to the port of Lifau, which later
became known as Oecussi. When the two European power formally
partitioned the island between them in the 19th century, it
remained part of the Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   Oecussi has always been the part of East Timor most susceptible
to the influence of the West.
</P>
<P>
   During the period of Indonesian infiltration leading up to the
invasion of 1975, it quickly came under the control of Jakarta.
Throughout the 24-year war, the guerrilla army Falintil had
virtually no presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the recent violence and ethnic cleansing
inflicted on Timor is an attempt to justify the partitioning off of
some of the East's provinces. If this turns out to be the case,
then Oecussi _ surrounded by Indonesia and with no independent land
route to Dili will be especially vulnerable. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At a disused listening station in the Berlin woods,
aging Cold Warriors fought possibly the final battle of the
conflict, and this time the Commies won.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited on a recent weekend, spies from East and West poured
scorn on their rivals, trumpeted their double agents, and pitted
their intelligence against the other side.
</P>
<P>
   More than pride was at stake. The convention, organized in West
Berlin by the CIA and its affiliates, had set out to prove Western
superiority in this, as in all other, domains.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the CIA, KGB, MI5 and other related organizations were
brought together for a discussion about the intelligence war in
Berlin before the Wall was built.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA called that era its ``Golden Times,'' years when its
agents roamed East Berlin unhindered, mining the rich seam of
Communist secrets. They had no equal, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here points to which side had the
most developed spy network,'' crowed Burton Gerber, former CIA
station chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and his colleagues cited their triumph during the
blockade, the tank confrontation in the autumn of 1961, and other
episodes in which only Western intelligence averted a global war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians listened for a while to all this triumphant talk,
and then retaliated with a barrage of boasts of their own.
</P>
<P>

Soviet agents at every federal agency in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   For every spy the West could boast of, the Soviets had dozens.
Berlin, the hub of operations for both sides, was saturated with

</P>
<P>
   No Stasi agents were present at the convention; a glaring

<P>
   East German spies were among the best, Kalugin said. ``You

the intelligence community,'' the former KGB officer urged his
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   They did not feel inclined to take up the invitation, just as
they were in no mood to applaud other exploits of the enemy. The
Cold War has long been over, yet red spies are still causing red
faces in the Western intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the first great reunion of the second
oldest profession took place in the shadow of events unfolding in

</P>
<P>

espionage,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, former controller of the British traitor George Blake,
thought dozens more KGB agents were still living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that generation works any more, because the game has
moved on. East still spies on the West and vice versa, but
technology is taking over the agents' work, and increasingly, their

</P>
<P>
   With that happy thought, the class of 1961 dispersed and

   BERLIN _ At a disused listening station in the Berlin woods,
aging Cold Warriors fought possibly the final battle of the
conflict, and this time the Commies won.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited on a recent weekend, spies from East and West poured
scorn on their rivals, trumpeted their double agents, and pitted
their intelligence against the other side.
</P>
<P>
   More than pride was at stake. The convention, organized in West
Berlin by the CIA and its affiliates, had set out to prove Western
superiority in this, as in all other, domains.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the CIA, KGB, MI5 and other related organizations were
brought together for a discussion about the intelligence war in
Berlin before the Wall was built.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA called that era its ``Golden Times,'' years when its
agents roamed East Berlin unhindered, mining the rich seam of
Communist secrets. They had no equal, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here points to which side had the
most developed spy network,'' crowed Burton Gerber, former CIA
station chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and his colleagues cited their triumph during the
blockade, the tank confrontation in the autumn of 1961, and other
episodes in which only Western intelligence averted a global war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians listened for a while to all this triumphant talk,
and then retaliated with a barrage of boasts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of deception and disinformation, we were the best,''
declared Oleg Kalugin, former head of KGB Counter-Intelligence.
``No one could lie the way we did. The British came close, but we
were better.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide on April
20, 1945, a little ceremony was held at the Fuhrerbunker.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated at last from the tyrannical house rules, the residents
lit up. Then they poured gasoline on the corpses and set fire to
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even by his own overblown standards, Hitler's fanatical hatred
of smoking was extraordinary. Eva Braun, Josef Goebbels and the
other unfortunate addicts who shared a roof with the Fuhrer in the
last days of the war had to sneak out into the smoldering ruins of
Berlin for a few furtive drags. Braun covered up her guilty secret
by chewing on mints.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, this historic first smoking ban at a
public place seems enlightened, at least from an American
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   And now a scholar from the U.S. has assembled compelling
evidence to prove that, largely because of Hitler's obsession, not
only the bunker but wartime Germany as a whole was at least 20
years ahead of the rest of the world in nailing tobacco down as the
cause of lung cancer, and in attempts to curb the filthy habit.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this discovery are enormous. Millions of
people puffed on after the war, oblivious to the dangers. On proper
medical advice, some might well have given up smoking and lived a
good few years longer.
</P>
<P>
   A reappraisal of German medical science is also in order. The
diabolical experiments of Robert Mengele and his ilk debased the
work of an entire generation of German scientists.
</P>
<P>
   It has been generally assumed that no worthwhile work was
carried out by biologists of the Third Reich, so tainted they all
were by their search for racial purity and related pseudo-science
projects. Rockets, the Nazis could build, but curing human ailments
was not their forte.
</P>
<P>
   The American historian Robert Proctor, author of the book ``The
Nazi War on Cancer,'' explodes that myth, only to raise further
unanswered questions: How did the knowledge gathered in the Third
Reich get lost, and why did it take the medical establishments in
Britain two decades and in the U.S. even longer to rediscover it?
Or did they know it all along?
</P>
<P>
   First, the evidence. It all goes back to the day Adolf Hitler
chucked his last packet of cigarettes into the Danube. Smoking, he
decided, was bad for him, and therefore bad for Germans. Tobacco
was one of the first things he would try to wipe off the face of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of posters proclaiming nicotine as ``poison for the
Aryan race'' were printed. Measures were promulgated, restricting
the sale of cigarettes to women, cutting soldiers' rations on the
Eastern Front, and banning smoking from cars, trains and buildings.
The Hitler Jugend were drafted in to spread the message with their
inimitable subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, money was poured into research. A link between
rising consumption of alcohol and tobacco and the incidence of
stomach and lung cancers had long been suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough came in 1939, when a PhD student at
Cologne University demonstrated for the first time a connection
between smoking and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 Hitler helped set up the ``Institute for the Struggle
Against the Dangers of Tobacco'' at Jena with 100,000 Reichsmarks
from his own budget.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the Jena scientists came up with the goods. Two
researchers named Eberhard Schairer and Erich Schoniger had carried
out a statistical analysis of the correlation between tobacco and
lung cancer, using a group of smokers as well as a control group.
</P>
<P>
   Their study, described by Professor Proctor as the ``crown jewel
of 20th century epidemiology,'' established that smokers ran an
increased risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To put this finding into perspective, Britain's Medical Research
Council claims to have been the ``first national institution in the
world to accept formally the evidence that tobacco is a major cause
of death.'' The MRC took that leap of faith in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Germany did not just investigate, it acted on its findings. As
early as 1939, the Nazis convened a congress on the dangers of
tobacco, attended by 15,000 scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, Hermann Goring forbade soldiers from smoking
on marches, in the streets or patrols. Cigarettes could not be sold
to women; drivers faced lawsuits for criminal negligence if found
smoking behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Research continued, with mixed success. Hitler was convinced of
tobacco's lingering genetic effects. But scientists did not dare to
report the results of their fertility studies which showed that
nicotine was, if anything, making laboratory rats more randy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of German life sciences. much of the tobacco
research was motivated by the Nazis' preoccupation with ``racial
hygene,'' and inevitably ended up in blind alleys. Stomach cancer
also drew a blank.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of their research has stood the test of time. ``If
it hadn't been for the war and the fact that this research had
ideological grounding, the Jena study would be considered a classic
early epidemiological work,'' says Professor George Davey-Smith of
Bristol University, who was the first to unearth this piece of the
jigsaw. ``I think it was underestimated.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   What a pity it all got lost. Or did it? German in those days was
the language of science, its scholars well enough respected _
prejudices and distaste notwithstanding _ to elicit academic
curiosity among their competitors elsewhere in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Their work was published by reputable journals. Even Mengele's
disgusting research on human guinea pigs in Auschwitz and the
inquiries German scientists were conducting at Buchenwald appeared
in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary what was in the medical journals of the
time,'' says Professor Paul Weindlings of Oxford Brookes
University, a leading expert on Nazi eugenics research. ``And the
British and Americans would just read them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not own up to it, of course. The international
scientific community did not want to get mixed up with the
unethical work of German colleagues, and therefore created the myth
that all German medical science had been paralyzed by primitive
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there were some really mad scientists
involved, but on the other hand you have to look at the people who
used the opportunities available to do very advanced work,'' says
Professor Doris Kaufmann.
</P>
<P>
   The German historian leads a group in Berlin which is going
through the archives of Germany's elite research institutes. What
they have discovered so far is that many scientists employed on
Goring's human projects were considered good enough to be given
jobs in the United States after the war. &QL;

   Japan's biggest cigarette manufacturer has ignited a row over a
plan to donate millions of free cigarettes to thousands of nursing
homes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco says the gift is its effort to mark the country's
national ``Respect for the Aged'' day.
</P>
<P>
   But the outraged Japanese anti-smoking lobby has accused the
company of plotting to kill millions of elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is practically telling people to hurry up and die,'' said
Bungaku Watanabe, head of the Tobacco Problems Information Center.
``It is almost the same as pushing them in front of a train.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Japan Tobacco, a former state monopoly, said
their ``contribution to society'' was a way ``to give something
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The company still enjoys the sole right to produce tobacco in
Japan and has an 80 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners lodged official protests saying the gift is a clear
breach of the spirit of the day, which is supposed to pay homage to
``the longevity of the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoking costs Japan more than 4 trillion yen a year in
smoking-related diseases and premature death. &QL;

and fearful that their apartment building could be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991
have Russians felt so strongly, and vocally, about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of rampant corruption bring a shrug and a yawn. Russians
have become all too accustomed to expect the worst of their
officials, from the ubiquitous streetcorner cop who demands bribes
from passing motorists to the bandit capitalists who have pumped
billions of dollars out of Russia and into Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis wiped out personal savings and jobs,
but elicited surprisingly little in the way of public outrage. Been
there, done that _ Russia and its struggling post-Soviet economy
have teetered on the brink of disaster several times in this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism striking home is something new and ominous. Two
apartment-block blasts in Moscow, and two in southern Russia _ all
of which followed an Aug. 31 bombing in a shopping mall near the
Kremlin _ have given the entire nation nights of fitful sleep.
Russians share the same unanswered questions: Who is responsible
for the bombings, and who is to blame for not preventing them?
</P>
<P>
   The public dismay comes as Russia prepares for important
parliamentary elections in December and next summer's vote to
choose a new president.
</P>
<P>
   The men who want to replace President Boris Yeltsin _
particularly his handpicked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his
chief rival Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov _ are scrambling to look
tough and blame the other for failing to protect Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a losing game for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they have no influence over what goes on in the
country,'' and they do not trust their leaders, said pollster Yuri
Levada. The result is cynicism and conspiracy theories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful Muscovites are seeing the bogeyman everywhere. One rumor
swept the city that people should be on the lookout for
watermelons, allegedly used as a means of concealing and
transporting explosives. (Not true, said a police spokesman).
Another rumor reported in a local newspaper suggested that
stray-looking dogs could instead be highly trained canine couriers
used to carry bombs into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that goes bump in the night is suspect, as is anyone
with a dark complexion who may come from the mountainous Caucasus
region on Russia's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities widely blame Islamic guerrillas from the
breakaway republic of Chechnya for supporting the bombing campaign
in Russia. Chechen rebel leaders named by Moscow deny complicity in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow police and special Interior Ministry troops have swept
the streets looking for suspects, a mobilization of force dubbed
``Operation Whirlwind,'' in which dark-skinned people from Chechnya
and other states in the Caucasus region have been targeted. More
than 11,000 ``suspects'' were taken into custody last week(CQ),
though police conceded that only about 30 were under serious
questioning as possible terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little public debate about human rights and the
rule of law. Terrorism now tops the agenda and the public apathy
about affairs of state has ended. People are scared and they want
something done about the bombs _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are there no resignations of people responsible for our
security? They should be ashamed to look into the eyes of the
people,'' said Slava, a shopkeeper in my neighborhood in southern
Moscow, just a short drive from the apartment buildings destroyed
by bombs on Sept. 9 and Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Many others do not trust their government and believe the
Kremlin itself, or forces aligned with it, could be responsible for
the terror. For months Yeltsin's political rivals have warned that
the Kremlin is planning to declare a state of emergency as a way to
cancel the elections and extend Yeltsin's term in office.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lack of hard evidence of Chechen involvement _ or, at
least, evidence that has been made public _ and no plausible claims
of responsibility have been made for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories and
supposed motives, often contradictory _ the Kremlin may have
ordered it, maybe the mob, maybe the state security services acting
on their own, Yeltsin wants to stay in power or Yeltsin will resign
early.
</P>
<P>
   Even the respected English-language daily, the Moscow Times, got
in on the act. In an editorial last week(CQ), it questioned why the
rubble from the two buildings destroyed in Moscow had been carted
away so soon. Why hadn't investigators taken their time sifting for
forensic evidence, the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechen theory has proved both viable and convenient for
federal authorities; investigators clearly think they've got a lock
on their suspects. Are they playing it safe (by trucking away the
ruins) and making sure no other options turn up?''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia and politics reign in Moscow today in the fallout of
the bombs. It is not a healthy combination in a country that has
struggled toward democracy and is better known for is disreputable
government and corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one hopeful sign, it is that Russians, at last, are
mad as hell. But will they do anything about it in the upcoming
elections?
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the regime directed the terror campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this highly charged political current has been reversed.
Terrorism, and the fear it has wrought in Moscow and across Russia,
could be the undoing of the powerful in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rare moments in life when millions of people think
in the same way,'' said an editorial last week(CQ) in the daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ``There is such a moment now when millions of
people who live in apartment blocks think the same thing when they
go to bed: whether they will be alive in the morning or not.''

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most business leaders here are reluctant to comment publicly on
the situation. Those who will speak choose their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has met with Chavez personally and finds him
cordial and attentive, agrees. But he worries that Chavez has spent
his first months in office focusing on politics and rewriting the
constitution, allowing the stumbling economy to worsen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't stuck a finger in business's eye, but we're also
very much waiting for a signal that the economy will be what he
will attend to next,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to say where
he's going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond says the biggest worry of most business leaders is the
caliber of Chavez's economic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly doesn't have any economic training, and he's
surrounded with people who are from the leftist parties,'' he said.
``On the other hand, he clearly has a huge mandate from the people,
and we all agree there is a real need for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond and other business leaders were expected to accompany
Chavez on a trip to New York and Washington last week(CQ),
hopefully using the visit to reassure financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want this president to be a success,'' he said.
``People are giving him the benefit of the doubt. But as with
everything else, he is going to have to be the one giving the
message. We're still anxiously awaiting that message.''

   MOSCOW _ Beware of the watermelons. Keep your eyes on those

transformed a town divided over a school levy and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought the community together. It gave us something to
rally around. People put their differences aside and the school is
better for it,'' Eldridge said. ``If the football team is down,
there's not that aura of cooperation amongst everybody.'' He said
football lets people cast aside prejudices rooted in educational or
financial differences. Respect becomes performance- and
effort-based.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Drees could have told Eldridge all about the power of high
school football.
</P>
<P>
   Drees figures he's watched more than 400 Covington Buccaneers
football games, home and away, since the team's inception in 1947.
Drees even schedules his annual departure for winter in Florida for
after the last regular-season game in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert on football,'' said Drees, 84, a Covington
mayor in the 1950s. ``I just enjoy the excitement, the thrill of
watching the boys. I'd almost feel bad if I didn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the beginning,'' he said, noting the team became a
winner in its second season, ``that was the thing to do, to go to
the football game.''
</P>
<P>
   High school football is an institution with a devout following
in small towns such as Covington. It means more than wins and
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, the game _ usually on a Friday night _ is a glue
that unites a community, allowing folks to catch up on each other's
lives and savor the emotional rush that comes with screaming lungs
out in a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday nights, the town might as well roll up the streets
because everyone's at the football game,'' said Maggie Amburgey,
owner of the Country Lace store in Covington.
</P>
<P>
   With the likely exception of Dayton, where basketball generally
garners the most support, football has reigned as the No. 1 sport
in rural Ohio. Down periods don't last long for powerhouses such as
Troy, Piqua, Kettering Fairmont and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning has a lot to do with it,'' said Jim Siewe, an
insurance salesman and Kettering Fairmont booster. ``Unfortunately,
but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics have studied the phenomenon of the loyalty to favorite
teams and discovered being a fan boosts people's self-esteem and
self-confidence, their sense of belonging and closeness to
neighbors, and overall happiness, said Charles Kimble, a University
of Dayton psychology professor.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University
in Kentucky, said the placement of games on a select number of
Friday nights adds to people's excitement about high school
football. ``You've worked your way through the work week. You can
think about those people saying, 'It's Wednesday. Only two more
days.'''
</P>
<P>
   People also revel in ``euphoric stress,'' a term psychologists
use to describe a nervousness that people welcome _ for example, as
sports fans or roller-coaster riders, Wann said. ``It helps them
feel invigorated. They seek out that energy.'' Doug McIntosh,
president of Carlisle High School's boosters, said the stands are
packed _ largely with older adults who don't have a kid in the
school system _ every game, no matter the team's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's just excited about football,'' he said. ``It
doesn't matter if we're 0-10 or 1-10 or 8-2. The turnout's still
there. Everybody still shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses chip in to help teams pay for their needs. Merchants
let parents display pictures of local players in their storefront
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Rituals abound: Residents paint their town's mascot in
driveways. There are bonfires and pep rallies. In some places on
Saturday mornings, regulars in coffee shops critique performances
of the evening before. ``Saturday-morning quarterbacking,'' Drees
called it.
</P>
<P>
   Walt McCutchan, a Lebanon parent, agreed. ``They'll talk about
it if you lose. They'll get you if you lose too.''
</P>
<P>
   Small towns most seem to demonstrate intimate involvement with
their teen athletes because parents typically know dozens if not
all of their kids' peers who are either in pads, cheerleading or in
band.
</P>
<P>
   Said Siewe, of the more densely populated Kettering, ``I
wouldn't say it's as rabid (here) as you might find in the smaller
towns, where everybody goes to the game, wouldn't think of doing
anything else on a Friday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reinforcing that small-town fan base is the tendency of
former players to remain town residents after high school
graduation or to return shortly into manhood to live where they
grew up. Men, many of whom have gained a few pounds since their own
glory days between the hash marks, thrill in seeing a son or
grandson, in peak physical condition, let an opposing ballcarrier
have it.Football is also valued, some said, for what it teaches
kids: discipline, responsibility and cooperation. It's also about
extreme physical exertion _ both in training and in the contest _
just like the prevailing farming work ethic in a predominantly
rural county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do this because they love the game. It's not for money,''
said Ed Lowther, 60, a retired counselor who lives in West Milton.
``There are a lot of people who would rather watch the high school
team than watch the Cleveland Browns if they were playing 10 miles
away. It's real football. It's not professional football, where
people get paid millions of dollars and are whiners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real and it's local.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Troy High School senior Joanna Lepore, ``Football is
religion around here. As soon as football season comes, the whole
town goes wild.'' Troy's 10,000-seat stadium, extraordinarily large
for a city of 21,000, plays a big part in that, according to Mayor
Pete Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   The stands include everyone from rabid fans to locals barely
moved by a clutch interception or circus reception, as high school
football affords residents chances to see each other on a regular
basis. Five Friday nights each fall serve as unofficial high school
and other reunions. The predictability of who attends goes a step
further: fans tend to sit in the same place every game.
</P>
<P>
   Residents' gushing of praise for high school football is not
universal.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Moore, who lives in Troy but grew up and works in Piqua,
thinks the demand for victories in those two towns is a mixed
blessing. She laments that less-skilled players don't get in games
often. Some kids don't get rewarded for their participation, she
said. ``I'm not against sports,'' the 54-year-old woman said. ``I
know in Troy, they don't ever want to lose a game. I'm sure
academics suffers. I think sportsmanship suffers. The kids don't
know how to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lepore, ``There's a whole attitude toward football players
that they're set apart'' out in the community. But at school, she
said, the players don't get special treatment from students and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In tiny Bradford, football is the essential source of civic
pride, some said. With some 300 students in the seventh- to
12th-grade school, residents are proud when their teams hold their
ground against the bigger schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only have half the amount of kids going out for a team
as Covington, if they do decent, it's saying something,'' said Rod
Kimmel, 32, who played football for Covington now lives in
Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Communities don't need a long-standing football tradition to
feel an affinity for the game, according to Erin Mitchell, 20, of
Pleasant Hill. Students in the Newton school district, lacking a
football program, head for West Milton on Friday nights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you lose, they don't care. They just want to see
someone play football.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ David Eldridge never thought of high school
football as a healer.

 &HT;    There oughta be a law, but not for Max and Mollie
 &HT;    (EDS: CQ Richerd.)
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Max Gordon and his bride-to-be,
Mollie Levy, got their marriage license in Delray Beach last week,
things weren't as simple as they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk handed us a book to read,'' Mollie remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I said, 'What's the book about?' and she said,
'Parenting.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting?'' Mollie said. ``We don't need to read the book, we
can write it.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Gordon is 90. Mollie Levy is 82. And between them they have
six children, 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But in Florida, their union is just another potential bad
marriage, a marriage that needs safeguarding by the Marriage
Preparation and Preservation Act of 1998, a law spawned by a desire
to protect children from the effects of bad marriages.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of being handed a license, Max and Mollie got a book
to read. They sat down with the Family Law Handbook to read about
the legal ramifications of marriage. Mollie had to read to Max
because of his cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just skimmed it,'' Mollie said. ``There was stuff about
child custody, and about how you should treat children if you have
them. The only reason I read it was because I thought we might get
tested on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they got back in line for the clerk, and got their next
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The license would cost them $88.50, unless they volunteered to
take a four-hour premarital course, which would give them a $32.50
discount on the cost of the license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you picture us sitting there with a bunch of 19 and 20
years olds trying to learn about marriage?'' Mollie said.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Mollie, who both outlived their first spouses after long
marriages, opted to skip the course and pay for the more expensive
license.
</P>
<P>
   No senior citizen discount this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day he reminds me about that $88 license,'' Mollie said.
</P>
<P>
   But Max isn't complaining too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time I make an honest woman out of her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Mollie have been living together in her condominium in
suburban Delray Beach for the past year. They had met when they
both lived in an independent living facility, and Max used to walk
by her door, whistling, ``Molly and me, and baby makes three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he saw me in a dress he said, 'Why do wear
slacks when you have such great gams?''' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   While hospitalized last month with an angina attack, Max floored
his 65-year-old son, Norton, by asking his permission to get
married again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Whatever you do is fine with me,''' the son said.
``I'm glad my father's getting married _ I missed his first one.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mollie broke the news to her 48-year-old son, he was happy
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Mom, you've got a better sex life than me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Max, who was married for 62 years the first time, said he's
looking forward to his new marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take what comes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's too bad Max and Mollie aren't taking the
premarital training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had anybody over 50 years old,'' said Richerd
Whittemore, a licensed clinical social worker in West Palm Beach
who teaches the course. ``It's not such a bad thing to do. There's
a lot of problem solving and communications skills we talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another course instructor, Beth Cutler, a mental health
counselor from Boca Raton, said the older couple would be able to
both learn and help others in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have a blast with them,'' she said. ``They'd have an
insight on life that people who are 30 years old don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Rossin (D-West Palm Beach), the state legislator who
sponsored the law creating the premarital classes, said he didn't
have newlyweds like Max and Mollie in mind when he sought to
protect young children from bad marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anybody could learn from the class,'' Rossin said.
``They'd meet younger people, and they'd probably have a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Max and Mollie said they've got enough excitement in their lives
right now. They just got a bigger dining room table to accommodate
feeding a suddenly larger extended family. There's an October
wedding to plan, and a honeymoon cruise a couple months later.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, they're not anticipating any marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we had an argument yet?'' Mollie asked.
</P>
<P>
   Max, hard of hearing, sat in his recliner and smiled without
realizing his talkative fiancee was speaking to him.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect couple.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Let's get one thing straight about this flap over
what kind of woman gets to enter the Miss America Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Guys don't care about what kind of woman gets to enter the Miss
America Pageant, because guys don't want to watch the Miss America
Pageant to start with.
</P>
<P>
   Guys would rather be watching football on the tube than watching
the Miss America pageant. Guys would rather be listening to John
Madden making grunting noises than watching the Miss America
Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether previously pregnant or formerly married women are
allowed to enter the Miss America Pageant is not an issue with most
guys. How many times have you heard guys talking about that over by
the office coffee pot? None. Having to watch the Miss America
Pageant at all is the real issue with guys.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a guy who is watching the Miss America Pageant, and I'll
show you some poor schlep who is watching it because his old lady
wants to see what kind of makeup Miss New Jersey is wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a guy watching the Miss America Pageant and I'll show
you a guy who is trying to find the remote so he can switch to
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a guy who is watching the Miss America Pageant at home
on TV, and I'll show you a father who has three girls, no boys _
and no vote.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty pageants are like $500,000 weddings. The only people who
enjoy them are females.
</P>
<P>
   So if all of the young women entered in the Miss America Pageant
aren't vestal virgins, most guys aren't going to lose a lot of
sleep over it. If, say, Miss Nebraska has been around the block a
few times, what difference does it make as long as she's had all of
her shots? Most guys are more concerned with the over and under on
the Denver game.
</P>
<P>
   So I find it highly amusing that Sheryl McCarthy, a columnist
for Newsday, is all worked up about the ``male sexual fantasy''
surrounding the Miss America Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, lady, get a grip. The male sexual fantasy ain't watching
some 18-year-old from Mississippi play ``Ode to Joy'' out of tune
on a French horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pageant is the embodiment of a male sexual fantasy that's
been embraced by millions of romance-seeking women whose real lives
don't fit the fantasy one bit,'' McCarthy writes.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's column laments that the recent attempt to change the
rules of the Miss America Pageant to include women who have been
pregnant, and formerly married women, was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people who run the Miss America Pageant were honest,
they'd admit that their annual extravaganza could be accurately be
called The Miss Pretend To Be a Virgin Contest,'' McCarthy writes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but so what? Guys don't care if Miss America is dating
the World Wrestling Federation, because guys don't want to be
watching Miss Arkansas yodel in D flat in the first place. Ladies,
do us a favor, call the whole thing off, and turn in your tiaras,
for gosh sakes. If I want to see somebody cry at the end, I can
watch the Jerry Lewis Telethon.
</P>
<P>
   If you ladies want to get your skirts in a knot about who gets
to enter the Miss America Pageant and who doesn't, don't drag us
guys into the argument.
</P>
<P>
   We just want to get our hands on the remote so we can watch the
World Series.

 &HT;    Eleven minutes that shouldn't happen to anyone
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The dispatcher stayed on the line for 11
minutes. Eleven long minutes. Through the thumping up the stairs.
Through his yells. Through her screams, shrill, eerie shrieks that
erupted from the depths of a frightened woman's soul.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed on through the gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' she kept saying. ``Hello. Hello. Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   She stayed on until the officer was there and the dead had been
counted. Two at the scene. One the next day at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only picture it,'' says West Palm Beach Police
Department spokeswoman Dena Peterson. ``I can't fathom it.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened last week in a townhouse off Village Boulevard _
one of those developments with the second-floor bedrooms and the
courtyard patio outside the front door _ is what Judge Cory Ciklin
works every day to prevent: A domestic shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Police say it happened like this. Arlister ``Joe'' Williams came
to his estranged wife's apartment to pick up some things. It was a
prearranged meeting, so his wife's sister let him in. Williams
stood at the foot of the stairs and talked to his wife. Then he
pulled out a .32-caliber pistol and started shooting. First, his
sister-in-law. Then her daughter. Both in the head. ``I don't
understand why the other deaths,'' says Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams chased his wife, Bridgette Williams, up the
stairs, through the bedroom, down the stairs. The struggle was so
loud and so violent that, at one point, police think he pulled off
half her ear lobe, earring and all. The screaming and struggling on
the 911 tape is like something from a bad movie. He followed her
out the front door, through the courtyard, down the sidewalk. He
dragged her back and shot her in the head, just like the others. He
left her collapsed just outside the courtyard gate. Then he shot
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Williams, 28, died. His estranged wife, also 28, didn't. But
she was in critical condition Tuesday, and it was unclear if she
will recover. Joe Williams also killed Bridgette's sister and
16-year-old niece.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the shooting, after Ciklin read about the murders
and Williams' suicide in the newspaper, Ciklin had his assistant
look up all the names in the computer. He wanted to quiet his
biggest fear.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to know if the Williamses had been before him
recently. They hadn't. ``That's the first thing I always do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's no way Ciklin _ who has been the main judge for
the domestic violence court division in Palm Beach County since it
was started in May 1998 _ can remember the nearly 4,000 cases that
came into his courtroom last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me appreciative of having had what I now know was a
normal childhood,'' says Ciklin, who will leave the domestic court
bench this January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was arguing in my family, but there was never any kind
of physical violence. But now I know that for thousands of
families, domestic violence is a way of life. It's an accepted way
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees husbands and wives who are headed for divorce but come
to his courtroom first to fake abuse so they will have the
``strategic advantage'' in the upcoming proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He sees first-timers, shocked and repentant. He sees stalkers
who swear they will stop. He sees husbands who beat their wives
again and again, and wives who fit all too tidily into the profile
of the abused woman. Right or wrong, explicable or downright
baffling, again and again, he watches women willing to ``take the
beatings so the children can be fed for another day.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his 18 months on the bench, Ciklin has also seen
something else.
</P>
<P>
   A little change. A little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   A little success.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who gets the nerve to leave. The children who are put
in a safe house. The man who goes through domestic abuse classes
and learns to deal with anger through words instead of fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are success stories from the letters I've
received,'' Ciklin said. ``We don't get hundreds of them. But we do
get three or five every month. Of course, receiving just one a
month is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Judge Cory Ciklin knows.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how life can unravel in a mere 11 minutes.

 &HT;    Safety nannies' war on modern life turns to cellular phones
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Somewhere in the world is the secret headquarters
of a powerful coalition of citizens who come from all walks of life
and yet share the single-minded goal to prevent popular
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   This coalition of killjoys, wet blankets, safety nannies,
Chicken Littles, tongue-cluckers and finger-waggers has opposed
every new popular invention since the flint knife. They are
``aginners,'' people who are against whatever they decide to be
against.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't know when this coalition began _ it is secret,
after all. But I can easily envision a group of hand-wringing cave
persons trying to throw cold water on the popular new invention of
a flint knife.
</P>
<P>
   The argument would be that cave persons have gotten along just
fine, thank you very much, with flat river rocks. Sharp rocks can
cut and be used to hurt innocent cave persons. Sharp rocks could
fall into the hands of cave children. In no time ``Ban Sharp
Rocks'' stickers could be seen on the clubs of the ancestors of
today's aginners. Or something similar.
</P>
<P>
   Over the millennia, this coalition of aginners has opposed
everything from the use of fire to the use of cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones have been a popular technological advance. The
descendents of the cave persons who loved flint knives love their
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally the coalition of aginners is trying to roll back
the clock to the heyday of human civilization _ when people huddled
in the dark and suffered. Boy, those were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The aginners first floated the junk science rumor that cell
phones cause brain tumors. Junk science is a favorite tactic for
aginners.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is difficult to prove a negative, it took time to
debunk the anti-cell phone brain-tumor tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the safety-nanny aginners switched to the threat to
the health and general welfare of society caused by people who use
cell phones when they drive.
</P>
<P>
   Using cell phones in cars is particularly disturbing to aginners
who opposed the invention of the horseless carriage in the first
place. They continue to fight to restrict the use of automobiles by
lobbying for laws to slow cars down to a cave baby's crawl with
government restrictions and traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   A vocal group of aginners once argued for the government to ban
radios in cars because the infernal devices could distract drivers
from their driving duties.
</P>
<P>
   Aginners who specialize in social arguments want to ban cell
phone use in shopping malls, supermarkets, restaurants and other
public places. Since people normally talk in shopping malls,
supermarkets, restaurants and other public places, the aginners are
reduced to arguing that it simply isn't proper to talk to someone
who either isn't present or isn't at the other end of endless miles
of copper wire. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   I like my cell phone. I don't want the aginners to screw up a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I am not hurting anyone, no one should care if I talk
on my cell phone any more than if I talk to myself, an invisible
blue marmoset or someone within arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no reason why I should be told where I can use my
cell phone as long as it is where other people are allowed to carry
on conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, cell phone conversations should be discouraged in
movie theaters, libraries and other places where normal
conversations are restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones in cars are no more dangerous than drivers who eat
Big Macs or drink designer water from car cup holders as they tool
down the road. Are we going to ban drive-through windows at
fast-food establishments or outlaw conversations with passengers in
cars? Don't ask the aginners. They might like the idea.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take one of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought hurricane names were in alphabetical order, but
after Dennis came Floyd. Was there not one beginning with ``E''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a tropical storm named Emily, the fifth of the 1999
hurricane season, Aug. 24-28. You didn't hear much about it because
it was one of the smallest tropical storms on record, with winds
barely above 35 mph extending only 60 miles from its center.
</P>
<P>
   Emily was spotted Aug. 23 as a tiny swirl of clouds, showers and
thunderstorms by the National Hurricane Center. Almost immediately,
Emily was pulled northward as it fell under the control of the much
larger Hurricane Cindy. Emily weakened to a tropical depression on
Aug. 26. By Aug. 28, when Cindy had intensified to a Category 4
hurricane with 140 mph winds and a far-reaching structure, Emily
was ripped apart and absorbed into its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every letter in the alphabet is used in storm names, by the
way. Q, U, X, Y and Z aren't included because of the scarcity of
names beginning with those letters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you list the top five contestants in the Miss America
contest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 4th runner-up was Miss Texas, Yanci Yarbrough, of
Childress; 3rd, Miss Maryland, Keri Schrader, of Rockville; 2nd,
Miss Pennsylvania, Susan Spafford, of Erie; 1st, Miss Illinois,
Jade Smalls, of Evanston. Miss Kentucky, Heather Renee French, of
Maysville, was crowned Miss America 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The media and public officials described the recent coastal
exodus in the face of Hurricane Floyd as ``the largest peacetime
evacuation in U.S. history.'' The implication is that there was a
bigger evacuation during wartime, but even those of us who lived
through World War II are aware of no such thing. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: This appears to be one of those sound bites that got out of
hand. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, records
indicate no evacuation in peacetime or otherwise in the United
States that was larger. It should have been described only as ``the
largest evacuation of this type,'' said FEMA spokeswoman Mary
Hudak, with no reference to ``peacetime.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, nearly 800,000 people were evacuated in preparation for
Hurricane Elena, she added, but that was well short of the
estimated 1.25 million evacuated from Florida alone for Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of former New York Jets star ``Broadway'' Joe
Namath? I haven't seen any mention of him in years.
</P>
<P>
   A: The dashing former football hero _ a brilliant quarterback
first with the University of Alabama, then with the Jets (1965-76),
and finally with the Los Angeles Rams (one season) _ has talked
about coaching or returning to broadcasting, but has decided
against both. He was hobbled for years with knee problems,
undergoing five operations before retiring after the 1977 season.
</P>
<P>
   Namath's current interest, in addition to a passion for golf, is
a football camp he and ex-teammate John Dockery operate for boys
ages 8-18 on the campus of Nichols College in Dudley, Mass. Other
than that, he stays out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Once the quintessential swinging bachelor, known for cruising
the hottest clubs and bars and squiring bombshells like Raquel
Welch, Namath settled down in 1984 when he married, ending the
playboy lifestyle that had fascinated the public for years. By
1998, the marriage crumbled and the couple filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a typhoon and a hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're regional terms given to the same type of mature
tropical cyclones, depending on where they develop. The term
hurricane is used for those originating over the North Atlantic and
eastern North Pacific oceans; typhoon, western North Pacific;
cyclones, Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean, and
within the coastal waters of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a church in South Carolina that
sells the original colonial-era Carolina Gold rice?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Holy Trinity Episcopal in Ridgeland, S.C. The rice is
grown at a Low Country plantation and some is donated to the church
to sell to the public. A limited amount is available now, priced at
$10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag plus $1.75 for shipping, the Rev. Johnnie
Davis told Q&AMP;A. The crop usually is harvested around the first of
December, he added, with milling starting soon thereafter. To check
on availability of the next crop, he suggested waiting until
December, then calling 843-726-3743. While he didn't speculate on
the kind of harvest expected, he said the crop last year was
``really good.'' Ridgeland didn't experience much rain or wind from
Hurricane Floyd, so that shouldn't be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for
its sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was
washed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you list how all the states ranked on their Scholastic
Aptitude Test scores?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But as the College Board warns: ``Comparing or ranking
states on the basis of SAT scores alone is invalid and strongly
discouraged by the College Board.'' And keep in mind the disparity
in the percentage of students taking the SAT, varying from 4
percent in Mississippi and South Dakota to 80 percent in
Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here's the information you want, from highest to
lowest combined verbal and math scores for 1999:
</P>
<P>
   1100s: North Dakota (1199); Iowa (1192); Minnesota (1184);

<P>
   Q: I've read that Habitat for Humanity International has built
and rehabilitated more than 80,000 houses. Where was the first
Habitat house built, and is it still there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Habitat for Humanity International evolved over a period of
time, developing from the seed of a small, interracial, Christian
farming community known as Koinonia Farm, in Sumter County, Ga.,
about 12 miles south of Americus. Koinonia was founded in 1942 by
farmer and biblical scholar Clarence Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Koinonia first laid out 42 half-acre sites, with 4 acres
reserved as a community park and recreational area, in 1968.
Millard and Linda Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity
International in 1976, first visited Koinonia in 1965, subsequently
developing the concept of ``partnership housing,'' where those in
need of adequate shelter would work side by side with volunteers to
build simple, decent houses.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat's first house, built in 1976, is at Koinonia. ``It's
still there, part of a thriving community,'' Habitat spokesman
Michael Crook told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed black ribbons worn on their uniforms by the San
Francisco Giants. What does that signify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ribbons, actually purple, were worn at the game Sept. 12
_ for that one day only _ in honor of ``RSVP Day,'' said Giants
spokesman Stan Martinez. RSVP stands for Results Stop Violence
Program, he said, explaining that it's an initiative against youth
violence. The Giants have been supporting the program for several
years, Martinez added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My stepson has been called to interview for his American
citizenship. He needs to bring proof of his Selective Service
registration, which he has lost. Where can we get a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Copies of proof of registration may be obtained by calling
Selective Service at 847-688-6888. You also may obtain a copy by
writing: Selective Service System, P.O. Box 94638, Palatine, IL
60094-4638. Make sure to provide your name, date of birth, Social
Security number and current mailing address. General information
about registration is available online at the Selective Service
System Web site: www.sss.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the hamlet of Chappaqua, N.Y.,
where the Clintons purchased a home? Is that the same place where
Sen.Ted Kennedy was involved in a car accident some years ago in
which a young woman died?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two different places. Two different states, even.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaqua, where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
will live in a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home, is in the
suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York City. The choice
of a home in New York allows Mrs. Clinton to be a resident of the
state in the likely event that she runs for the U.S. Senate. The
five-bedroom home was purchased after President Clinton's chief
fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, personally secured the loan by
putting up $1.35 million of his own money with Bankers Trust, which
holds the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaquiddick is a small island just off the eastern tip of
Martha's Vineyard, itself an island off the coast of Massachusetts.
It became a household word on the night of July 18, 1969, when a
car driven by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) plunged off a small
wooden bridge into a pond. His 28-year-old companion, Mary Jo
Kopechne, was drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Cardinal John O'Connor had a brain tumor removed recently.
Can you tell me what type tumor, and the prognosis?
</P>
<P>
   A: As previously reported, O'Connor, complaining of nausea and
weakness, was hospitalized in New York for tests Aug. 25. Doctors
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center removed the tumor, and he
was released Sept. 5, with radiation therapy expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   An initial statement on the 79-year-old cardinal's condition
issued by Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the Archdiocese of New
York, gave no details about the nature of the tumor or its precise
size and location, and Zwilling said he couldn't release any more
information. But it was reported in The New York Times that the
tumor was confined to the brain's surface.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor made his first public appearance after the surgery
Sept. 12. Speaking at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral, he didn't
say whether the tumor was malignant, or what the prognosis might
be. Contacted at the archdiocese offices Sept. 16, Zwilling said
O'Connor ``is resuming his schedule gradually and is doing much
better.''

   Q: News reports mentioned that an elite force of Gurkha fighters
from Nepal were going to participate in the peacekeeping force that
is about to go to East Timor. Who are they, and what are they known
for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gurkhas first came to Nepal in the 12th century, when they
were driven out of northern India by the Muslims. The Gurkhas claim
descent from the warlike Rajputs of northern India, in the present
state of Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting quality of Nepal's Gurkha solders, an ethnically
diverse military force created by Prithvi Narayan Shah, is
legendary. He led them in their 1769 conquest of the Nepal Valley,
which resulted in the consolidation of numerous petty
principalities and provided the foundation for the modern state of
Nepal. From the mid-1800s, the Gurkha troops were heavily recruited
by Britain and, since 1947 have been a significant minority within
the army of India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A published list of the costliest U.S. hurricanes omitted
Opal, which swept northward from the Gulf of Mexico a couple of
years ago. How did it compare?
</P>
<P>
   A: Opal ranks 27th on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's list of the top 30 damaging U.S. hurricanes
between 1900 and 1998. The storm, rated Category 3, struck
northwest Florida and Alabama in 1995 and caused damage estimated
at $3.3 billion (normalized to 1998 dollars by inflation, wealth
increases, and coastal county population changes). The NOAA list,
by the way, ranks a Category 4 hurricane striking southeast Florida
and Alabama in 1926 as No. 1, causing $80.6 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read several months ago that Amy Carter was expecting a
baby, but I never saw a follow-up. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The birth of Hugo James Wentzel was reported July 31. Amy
Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn
Carter, gave birth to her son July 29 at a metro Atlanta hospital.
He weighed 7 pounds, 13 ounces. Amy Carter is married to computer
specialist Jim Wentzel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen several mentions of the Saffir-Simpson scale used
to measure the strength of hurricanes. Who were Saffir and Simpson?
</P>
<P>
   A: Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson were the developers in 1973
of the damage-potential scale named for them. Simpson was director
of the National Hurricane Center and Saffir was a construction
engineer and wind specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Their scale separates mature hurricanes _ tropical cyclones with
winds of 74 mph or greater _ into five ascending classes or
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember Bill Bradley being called ``Dollar Bill'' when he
played in the NBA. Can you find out what that meant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people say it comes from his austere tipping and
spending habits, while others accept the more likely explanation
that he hit the jackpot long before the NBA's megabuck explosion
when, in 1967, he signed a $500,000 contract with the New York
Knicks. Yet another explanation is that in ``street'' basketball,
when a player shoots and is confident the ball will go in, the
player shouts ``money,'' as in ``It's money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read a brief item about Casey Riggan, a Midland, Texas,
student who was punished for taking a photo of his married
principal's car outside a teacher's house. Could we have a little
more detail? Was the photo displayed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The picture was never taken to Midland High School, and it
wasn't taken on school property or during school time, said
Riggan's mother, Gail. ``They (school officials) have absolutely no
right under the law to say he can't photograph a car in front of a
house, something that anybody else in the nation can do,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, 18, a senior who was barred from graduation after word of
the picture got around town and rumors about the principal began to
circulate, said he just kept the picture in a closet at home. But
he and his friends talked about it. When Neil RIchmond, the
principal, asked him to write a formal apology, the teen refused,
precipitating his suspension. Richmond says Riggan was disciplined
for being disrespectful to an adult by fostering rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Riggan, meanwhile, claims that he didn't even take the picture.
He said he believes the student who did take it wasn't suspended
because he was a star on the school baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The student has filed a federal lawsuit against the school
district for infringing on his right of free speech. U.S. District
Judge Royal Ferguson, who already has thrown out several motions
from Riggan's attorney, is expected to decide soon whether the
lawsuit warrants a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is Walter Payton doing? Back in the winter it was
reported that he had a rare liver disease, but I haven't seen any
mention of him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: There hasn't been much to report since the legendary former
member of the Chicago Bears _ one of the greatest all-around
running backs in football history _ tearfully delivered the news to
reporters that he's suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis
and in need of a liver transplant. Soon after, Payton joined a list
of 12,000 people who share his blood type and are waiting for
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, it was reported that Payton's disease was
progressing faster than expected, and a few weeks later he began
wearing a beeper to notify him if a donated liver was available so
he could go immediately to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for the
transplant operation. Then on March 5 his wife, Connie, said he
wouldn't be able to attend the opening of Galyan's, a sporting
goods megastore in Chicago. ``Right now, in your prayers is the
best place for Walter,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   While he threw out the first pitch at the Cubs' home opener in
April, he then had to cancel a personal appearance the following
day because of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can follow the latest reports on Payton's health online,
and send messages of support, at a site operated by the Chicago
Tribune: www.chicago.tribune.com/sports/bears/ (in the list of
continuing stories, click on Walter Payton's fight).
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of a weather-related evacuation order, what does
``mandatory'' mean, when some people seem to stay put anyway?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no strict, universal definition of ``mandatory,''
meaning one that would apply to every area and in every case, said
Mary Hudak of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Decisions on
evacuations are up to local authorities and can vary from county to
county, even from sheriff to sheriff. Part of what FEMA does is
provide ``the best information available'' to those local officials
so they can make the best decisions for the well-being of
residents, Hudak added.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's a free country and people cannot be forcibly
removed from their homes if they choose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a tidal wave and a storm surge
associated with a hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: The effect on a coastline may be similar, since both can be
tremendously devastating, but they're not the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A ``tidal wave'' _ which should be called a tsunami or seismic
sea wave, because it has no connection with the tides _ is a
catastrophic ocean wave usually caused by an underwater earthquake
with a magnitude greater than 6.5 on the Richter scale. Underwater
or coastal landslide or volcanic eruptions also may cause a
tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   A storm surge is an increase in the average water level _
possibly of 15 feet or more _ as the hurricane or other intense
storm moves close to the coast. The advancing storm surge combines
with the normal tide to create the hurricane storm tide. This
buildup of water level can cause severe flooding in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't Timor where Capt. William Bligh and some of his crewmen
landed after the mutiny on the HMS Bounty and their subsequent long
ordeal at sea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right you are. In a remarkable feat of seamanship, Bligh
(captain of the Bounty, but with the rank of lieutenant in the
British navy) and the crew members who were loyal to him reached
Timor on June 14, 1789, after a voyage of about 3,600 miles in an
open longboat. They had been turned adrift after Fletcher Christian
and other mutineers seized
</P>
<P>
   Q: Serena Williams, who defeated Martina Hingis to win the U.S.
Open, was quoted as saying,``I'm so excited I had a chance to
accomplish that while she's still alive,'' referring to Althea
Gibson. What is Gibson's condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tennis legend _ in 1957, the first black player to win
the Wimbledon singles title and the first to win the U.S. national
title, among many other championships _ has developed various
ailments and has suffered two strokes that apparently left her
barely able to walk or talk. So she lives almost as a recluse in
East Orange, N.J., refusing interview requests and rarely venturing
out.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Clayton-Gray, executive director of the East
Orange-based Althea Gibson Foundation, told reporters earlier this
year that the former tennis star ``just basically wants to rest.''
Doctors say Gibson, 72, is severely depressed, but in essence
suffers from a broken spirit. She wasn't even able to attend the
dedication in May of the Althea Gibson Early Childhood Education
Academy in East Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reclusiveness, Gibson is said always to take an
annual birthday call from former New York Mayor David Dinkens. Both
were born in 1927, he in Trenton, N.J., and Gibson in Silver, S.C.
Dinkens' call always begins: ``Hey, champ.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take one of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought hurricane names were in alphabetical order, but
after Dennis came Floyd. Was there not one beginning with ``E''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a tropical storm named Emily, the fifth of the 1999
hurricane season, Aug. 24-28. You didn't hear much about it because
it was one of the smallest tropical storms on record, with winds
barely above 35 mph extending only 60 miles from its center.
</P>
<P>
   Emily was spotted Aug. 23 as a tiny swirl of clouds, showers and
thunderstorms by the National Hurricane Center. Almost immediately,
Emily was pulled northward as it fell under the control of the much
larger Hurricane Cindy. Emily weakened to a tropical depression on
Aug. 26. By Aug. 28, when Cindy had intensified to a Category 4
hurricane with 140 mph winds and a far-reaching structure, Emily
was ripped apart and absorbed into its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every letter in the alphabet is used in storm names, by the
way. Q, U, X, Y and Z aren't included because of the scarcity of
names beginning with those letters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you list the top five contestants in the Miss America
contest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 4th runner-up was Miss Texas, Yanci Yarbrough, of
Childress; 3rd, Miss Maryland, Keri Schrader, of Rockville; 2nd,
Miss Pennsylvania, Susan Spafford, of Erie; 1st, Miss Illinois,
Jade Smalls, of Evanston. Miss Kentucky, Heather Renee French, of
Maysville, was crowned Miss America 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The media and public officials described the recent coastal
exodus in the face of Hurricane Floyd as ``the largest peacetime
evacuation in U.S. history.'' The implication is that there was a
bigger evacuation during wartime, but even those of us who lived
through World War II are aware of no such thing. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: This appears to be one of those sound bites that got out of
hand. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, records
indicate no evacuation in peacetime or otherwise in the United
States that was larger. It should have been described only as ``the
largest evacuation of this type,'' said FEMA spokeswoman Mary
Hudak, with no reference to ``peacetime.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, nearly 800,000 people were evacuated in preparation for
Hurricane Elena, she added, but that was well short of the
estimated 1.25 million evacuated from Florida alone for Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of former New York Jets star ``Broadway'' Joe
Namath? I haven't seen any mention of him in years.
</P>
<P>
   A: The dashing former football hero _ a brilliant quarterback
first with the University of Alabama, then with the Jets (1965-76),
and finally with the Los Angeles Rams (one season) _ has talked
about coaching or returning to broadcasting, but has decided
against both. He was hobbled for years with knee problems,
undergoing five operations before retiring after the 1977 season.
</P>
<P>
   Namath's current interest, in addition to a passion for golf, is
a football camp he and ex-teammate John Dockery operate for boys
ages 8-18 on the campus of Nichols College in Dudley, Mass. Other
than that, he stays out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Once the quintessential swinging bachelor, known for cruising
the hottest clubs and bars and squiring bombshells like Raquel
Welch, Namath settled down in 1984 when he married, ending the
playboy lifestyle that had fascinated the public for years. By
1998, the marriage crumbled and the couple filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a typhoon and a hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're regional terms given to the same type of mature
tropical cyclones, depending on where they develop. The term
hurricane is used for those originating over the North Atlantic and
eastern North Pacific oceans; typhoon, western North Pacific;
cyclones, Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean, and
within the coastal waters of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a church in South Carolina that
sells the original colonial-era Carolina Gold rice?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Holy Trinity Episcopal in Ridgeland, S.C. The rice is
grown at a Low Country plantation and some is donated to the church
to sell to the public. A limited amount is available now, priced at
$10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag plus $1.75 for shipping, the Rev. Johnnie
Davis told Q&AMP;A. The crop usually is harvested around the first of
December, he added, with milling starting soon thereafter. To check
on availability of the next crop, he suggested waiting until
December, then calling 843-726-3743. While he didn't speculate on
the kind of harvest expected, he said the crop last year was
``really good.'' Ridgeland didn't experience much rain or wind from
Hurricane Floyd, so that shouldn't be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for
its sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was
washed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you list how all the states ranked on their Scholastic
Aptitude Test scores?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But as the College Board warns: ``Comparing or ranking
states on the basis of SAT scores alone is invalid and strongly
discouraged by the College Board.'' And keep in mind the disparity
in the percentage of students taking the SAT, varying from 4
percent in Mississippi and South Dakota to 80 percent in
Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here's the information you want, from highest to
lowest combined verbal and math scores for 1999:
</P>
<P>
   1100s: North Dakota (1199); Iowa (1192); Minnesota (1184);
Wisconsin (1179); South Dakota (1173); Illinois and Kansas (tie,
1154); Missouri (1144); Nebraska (1139); Utah (1138); Oklahoma
(1127); Michigan (1122); Louisiana and Arkansas (tie, 1119);
Alabama (1116); Tennessee (1112); Mississippi (1111); Ohio (1102).

<P>
   Q: I've read that Habitat for Humanity International has built
and rehabilitated more than 80,000 houses. Where was the first
Habitat house built, and is it still there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Habitat for Humanity International evolved over a period of
time, developing from the seed of a small, interracial, Christian
farming community known as Koinonia Farm, in Sumter County, Ga.,
about 12 miles south of Americus. Koinonia was founded in 1942 by
farmer and biblical scholar Clarence Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Koinonia first laid out 42 half-acre sites, with 4 acres
reserved as a community park and recreational area, in 1968.
Millard and Linda Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity
International in 1976, first visited Koinonia in 1965, subsequently
developing the concept of ``partnership housing,'' where those in
need of adequate shelter would work side by side with volunteers to
build simple, decent houses.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat's first house, built in 1976, is at Koinonia. ``It's
still there, part of a thriving community,'' Habitat spokesman
Michael Crook told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed black ribbons worn on their uniforms by the San
Francisco Giants. What does that signify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ribbons, actually purple, were worn at the game Sept. 12
_ for that one day only _ in honor of ``RSVP Day,'' said Giants
spokesman Stan Martinez. RSVP stands for Results Stop Violence
Program, he said, explaining that it's an initiative against youth
violence. The Giants have been supporting the program for several
years, Martinez added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My stepson has been called to interview for his American
citizenship. He needs to bring proof of his Selective Service
registration, which he has lost. Where can we get a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Copies of proof of registration may be obtained by calling
Selective Service at 847-688-6888. You also may obtain a copy by
writing: Selective Service System, P.O. Box 94638, Palatine, IL
60094-4638. Make sure to provide your name, date of birth, Social
Security number and current mailing address. General information
about registration is available online at the Selective Service
System Web site: www.sss.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the hamlet of Chappaqua, N.Y.,
where the Clintons purchased a home? Is that the same place where
Sen.Ted Kennedy was involved in a car accident some years ago in
which a young woman died?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two different places. Two different states, even.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaqua, where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
will live in a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home, is in the
suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York City. The choice
of a home in New York allows Mrs. Clinton to be a resident of the
state in the likely event that she runs for the U.S. Senate. The
five-bedroom home was purchased after President Clinton's chief
fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, personally secured the loan by
putting up $1.35 million of his own money with Bankers Trust, which
holds the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaquiddick is a small island just off the eastern tip of
Martha's Vineyard, itself an island off the coast of Massachusetts.
It became a household word on the night of July 18, 1969, when a
car driven by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) plunged off a small
wooden bridge into a pond. His 28-year-old companion, Mary Jo
Kopechne, was drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Cardinal John O'Connor had a brain tumor removed recently.
Can you tell me what type tumor, and the prognosis?
</P>
<P>
   A: As previously reported, O'Connor, complaining of nausea and
weakness, was hospitalized in New York for tests Aug. 25. Doctors
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center removed the tumor, and he
was released Sept. 5, with radiation therapy expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   An initial statement on the 79-year-old cardinal's condition
issued by Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the Archdiocese of New
York, gave no details about the nature of the tumor or its precise
size and location, and Zwilling said he couldn't release any more
information. But it was reported in The New York Times that the
tumor was confined to the brain's surface.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor made his first public appearance after the surgery
Sept. 12. Speaking at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral, he didn't
say whether the tumor was malignant, or what the prognosis might
be. Contacted at the archdiocese offices Sept. 16, Zwilling said
O'Connor ``is resuming his schedule gradually and is doing much
better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: News reports mentioned that an elite force of Gurkha fighters
from Nepal were going to participate in the peacekeeping force that
is about to go to East Timor. Who are they, and what are they known
for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gurkhas first came to Nepal in the 12th century, when they
were driven out of northern India by the Muslims. The Gurkhas claim
descent from the warlike Rajputs of northern India, in the present
state of Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting quality of Nepal's Gurkha solders, an ethnically
diverse military force created by Prithvi Narayan Shah, is
legendary. He led them in their 1769 conquest of the Nepal Valley,
which resulted in the consolidation of numerous petty
principalities and provided the foundation for the modern state of
Nepal. From the mid-1800s, the Gurkha troops were heavily recruited
by Britain and, since 1947 have been a significant minority within
the army of India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A published list of the costliest U.S. hurricanes omitted
Opal, which swept northward from the Gulf of Mexico a couple of
years ago. How did it compare?
</P>
<P>
   A: Opal ranks 27th on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's list of the top 30 damaging U.S. hurricanes
between 1900 and 1998. The storm, rated Category 3, struck
northwest Florida and Alabama in 1995 and caused damage estimated
at $3.3 billion (normalized to 1998 dollars by inflation, wealth
increases, and coastal county population changes). The NOAA list,
by the way, ranks a Category 4 hurricane striking southeast Florida
and Alabama in 1926 as No. 1, causing $80.6 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read several months ago that Amy Carter was expecting a
baby, but I never saw a follow-up. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The birth of Hugo James Wentzel was reported July 31. Amy
Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn
Carter, gave birth to her son July 29 at a metro Atlanta hospital.
He weighed 7 pounds, 13 ounces. Amy Carter is married to computer
specialist Jim Wentzel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen several mentions of the Saffir-Simpson scale used
to measure the strength of hurricanes. Who were Saffir and Simpson?
</P>
<P>
   A: Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson were the developers in 1973
of the damage-potential scale named for them. Simpson was director
of the National Hurricane Center and Saffir was a construction
engineer and wind specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Their scale separates mature hurricanes _ tropical cyclones with
winds of 74 mph or greater _ into five ascending classes or
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember Bill Bradley being called ``Dollar Bill'' when he
played in the NBA. Can you find out what that meant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people say it comes from his austere tipping and
spending habits, while others accept the more likely explanation
that he hit the jackpot long before the NBA's megabuck explosion
when, in 1967, he signed a $500,000 contract with the New York
Knicks. Yet another explanation is that in ``street'' basketball,
when a player shoots and is confident the ball will go in, the
player shouts ``money,'' as in ``It's money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read a brief item about Casey Riggan, a Midland, Texas,
student who was punished for taking a photo of his married
principal's car outside a teacher's house. Could we have a little
more detail? Was the photo displayed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The picture was never taken to Midland High School, and it
wasn't taken on school property or during school time, said
Riggan's mother, Gail. ``They (school officials) have absolutely no
right under the law to say he can't photograph a car in front of a
house, something that anybody else in the nation can do,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, 18, a senior who was barred from graduation after word of
the picture got around town and rumors about the principal began to
circulate, said he just kept the picture in a closet at home. But
he and his friends talked about it. When Neil RIchmond, the
principal, asked him to write a formal apology, the teen refused,
precipitating his suspension. Richmond says Riggan was disciplined
for being disrespectful to an adult by fostering rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Riggan, meanwhile, claims that he didn't even take the picture.
He said he believes the student who did take it wasn't suspended
because he was a star on the school baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The student has filed a federal lawsuit against the school
district for infringing on his right of free speech. U.S. District
Judge Royal Ferguson, who already has thrown out several motions
from Riggan's attorney, is expected to decide soon whether the
lawsuit warrants a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is Walter Payton doing? Back in the winter it was
reported that he had a rare liver disease, but I haven't seen any
mention of him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: There hasn't been much to report since the legendary former
member of the Chicago Bears _ one of the greatest all-around
running backs in football history _ tearfully delivered the news to
reporters that he's suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis
and in need of a liver transplant. Soon after, Payton joined a list
of 12,000 people who share his blood type and are waiting for
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, it was reported that Payton's disease was
progressing faster than expected, and a few weeks later he began
wearing a beeper to notify him if a donated liver was available so
he could go immediately to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for the
transplant operation. Then on March 5 his wife, Connie, said he
wouldn't be able to attend the opening of Galyan's, a sporting
goods megastore in Chicago. ``Right now, in your prayers is the
best place for Walter,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   While he threw out the first pitch at the Cubs' home opener in
April, he then had to cancel a personal appearance the following
day because of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can follow the latest reports on Payton's health online,
and send messages of support, at a site operated by the Chicago
Tribune: www.chicago.tribune.com/sports/bears/ (in the list of
continuing stories, click on Walter Payton's fight).
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of a weather-related evacuation order, what does
``mandatory'' mean, when some people seem to stay put anyway?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no strict, universal definition of ``mandatory,''
meaning one that would apply to every area and in every case, said
Mary Hudak of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Decisions on
evacuations are up to local authorities and can vary from county to
county, even from sheriff to sheriff. Part of what FEMA does is
provide ``the best information available'' to those local officials
so they can make the best decisions for the well-being of
residents, Hudak added.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's a free country and people cannot be forcibly
removed from their homes if they choose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a tidal wave and a storm surge
associated with a hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: The effect on a coastline may be similar, since both can be
tremendously devastating, but they're not the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A ``tidal wave'' _ which should be called a tsunami or seismic
sea wave, because it has no connection with the tides _ is a
catastrophic ocean wave usually caused by an underwater earthquake
with a magnitude greater than 6.5 on the Richter scale. Underwater
or coastal landslide or volcanic eruptions also may cause a
tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   A storm surge is an increase in the average water level _
possibly of 15 feet or more _ as the hurricane or other intense
storm moves close to the coast. The advancing storm surge combines
with the normal tide to create the hurricane storm tide. This
buildup of water level can cause severe flooding in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't Timor where Capt. William Bligh and some of his crewmen
landed after the mutiny on the HMS Bounty and their subsequent long
ordeal at sea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right you are. In a remarkable feat of seamanship, Bligh
(captain of the Bounty, but with the rank of lieutenant in the
British navy) and the crew members who were loyal to him reached
Timor on June 14, 1789, after a voyage of about 3,600 miles in an
open longboat. They had been turned adrift after Fletcher Christian
and other mutineers seized
</P>
<P>
   Q: Serena Williams, who defeated Martina Hingis to win the U.S.
Open, was quoted as saying,``I'm so excited I had a chance to
accomplish that while she's still alive,'' referring to Althea
Gibson. What is Gibson's condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tennis legend _ in 1957, the first black player to win
the Wimbledon singles title and the first to win the U.S. national
title, among many other championships _ has developed various
ailments and has suffered two strokes that apparently left her
barely able to walk or talk. So she lives almost as a recluse in
East Orange, N.J., refusing interview requests and rarely venturing
out.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Clayton-Gray, executive director of the East
Orange-based Althea Gibson Foundation, told reporters earlier this
year that the former tennis star ``just basically wants to rest.''
Doctors say Gibson, 72, is severely depressed, but in essence
suffers from a broken spirit. She wasn't even able to attend the
dedication in May of the Althea Gibson Early Childhood Education
Academy in East Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reclusiveness, Gibson is said always to take an
annual birthday call from former New York Mayor David Dinkens. Both
were born in 1927, he in Trenton, N.J., and Gibson in Silver, S.C.
Dinkens' call always begins: ``Hey, champ.''

 &HT;    Peppers reach their prime for preserving
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's now or never. Unless you relish paying
winter prices of $2.99 when you need just one red bell pepper, this
is the week to pick a peck of peppers and put 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking anything serious such as canning; nothing that
requires precise skills. This job can be as easy as cutting a
pepper into chunks, freezing the chunks on a cookie sheet and
bagging them up for a winter soup or stew.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to spend a little more time, an even better
way to enjoy these peppers later is to roast them. Char and blister
them on a grill, range or under the broiler. Once skinned and
seeded, they can be packed in oil. Roasted peppers can be stored
for a while in the refrigerator but last for months in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that preserving peppers is one of those summer
projects worth putting off until the last moment. The bell peppers
started turning color in August, but the price still was high. But
now you can find red peppers as low as five for $1.
</P>
<P>
   At that price you can afford to be selective. This year it's
important to take a good look at what you buy. Some farmers without
irrigation have a skimpy harvest and less-than-ideal crop. But Mike
Brown, who is blessed with irrigation at his farm, has a field of
5,000 plants full of big, ripe peppers. If you're feeling
ambitious, he'll sell you a peck for $6.
</P>
<P>
   If you're roasting the peppers, take a few minutes to pick out
specimens that are reasonably straight-sided. Some peppers grow
into convoluted shapes that never evenly roast. Perfect peppers
command the highest price, two for $1. But if you're just cutting
them up to freeze, the twisted ones are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid any peppers that are wrinkled or soft. Red bells tend to
soften on the stalk more quickly than green and are more perishable
once picked. And some farmers don't cull them out before they truck
them to market.

 &HT;    Roast, freeze peppers to preserve
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how to preserve those peppers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Freeze them: With a large knife, cut off the tops and bottom,
then cut the pepper in half vertically. Remove and discard seeds
and ribs. Cut the pepper halves into quarters, 1/2-inch slices or
large squares. Place in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Cover
with waxed paper and freeze until firm. Bag them in sturdy freezer
bags. If you thaw them before using, the peel easily pulls off. You
can also freeze whole peppers. Remove the stem and scoop out the
seeds and ribs from the top. Freeze and when solid, nestle them
together in batches of four. Wrap with plastic wrap and seal well
in freezer bags. They will keep their shape if you stuff the pepper
shells while still frozen before cooking them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roast them: If you're doing just a few peppers, it's easy to
spear them with the tines of a fork and roast them over the gas
flame of the stove. When the skin is blistered and blackened _ but
not burned _ put them in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap
to let the steam loosen the skin. After 10 or 15 minutes, use a
sharp knife to pull off the peel. Do this over the bowl to retain
any juices. Cut the peppers in half and remove the seeds, ribs and
stem. Layer them with oil, preferably olive oil, in a sterilized
glass jar or plastic freezer container. Freeze in amounts usable
for a single recipe. For more immediate use, place in containers
with a lid and cover with olive oil, making sure the peppers are
fully immersed. Cover and refrigerate. Resist the impulse to add
garlic, which can cause contamination.
</P>
<P>
   If you're roasting a peck of peppers, place them on a broiler
rack or over the medium coals of a grill. Turn until all sides are
blackened, then place in a bowl and cover until steam loosens the
skin.

 &HT;    Good pepper prices sweeten dishes
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At $3 a pop for peppers in winter, the eight peppers needed for
this recipe would cost $24.
</P>
<P>
   Roast your own peppers using local two-for-$1 peppers and you
can cut that price to $4, an acceptable expenditure for an elegant
side dish.
</P>
<P>
   GRATIN OF RED PEPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   8 roasted red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   If using oil-packed peppers, drain them well. Cut the peppers
into strips.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange half the pepper strips in the bottom of a medium gratin
dish or glass casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Puree the remaining red peppers with the cream in a blender or
food processor. Season with salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pour the pepper cream over the pepper strips, sprinkle with the
cheese and place briefly in the 450-degree oven to heat through.
Alternatively, place under a hot broiler until the mixture bubbles
and sizzles.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately with bread to soak up any extra pepper sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe is from the new Peppers Peppers Peppers by Marlena
Spieler (Firefly, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Peperonata is a pepper mixture that can be served with grilled
bread as an appetizer or as a side dish. Because the pepper chunks
are cooked for a long time, there is little lost by using frozen
peppers. And using frozen chunks makes this a dish that can be
assembled in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   PEPERONATA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 cups
</P>
<P>
   6 bell peppers, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh chopped oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley or 2 tablespoons fresh
chopped basil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place the peppers in a shallow baking pan. Toss them with the
garlic, oil, vinegar, oregano, salt and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove, taste
and adjust seasoning, adding more vinegar, salt and sugar if
necessary. Return to the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the parsley or basil. The
peppers can be served warm or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   For a more substantial appetizer or lunch, top the peppers with
slices of goat cheese and return to the oven until lightly browned
and soft.
</P>
<P>
   If you've also frozen yellow peppers, include some for
contrasting color.

 &HT;    WINE COLUMN: Some things are better left alone
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Basking in the artificial afterglow of a
health-label victory, some wine producers and marketers want to
take another big leap, this time seeking to sell souped-up wine as
a beneficial drug.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. Talk about a slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   The wine is called Le Vin du Coeur, a rose-style wine from the
Provence region of France. Its gimmick: It contains extra
polyphenols, the naturally occurring compounds from the skin and
seeds of grapes that some research suggests make red wine in
moderation good for the heart. The French pink wine has twice the
amount of polyphenols normally found in red wine, according to
publicity materials. (A quick check suggests the wine hasn't made
it yet to the local market.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest trend in the food world _ and one of the hottest
marketing segments of the industry _ is to enhance the naturally
occurring health benefits of particular foods,'' gushes the press
release. ```Functional foods,' `designer foods,' `nutraceuticals'
and `pharmafoods' are all buzzwords that are becoming more popular
with consumers, scientists, culinary historians and food and
beverage manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, not this consumer, thanks. At least, not with my wine.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers of the new ``heart-healthy'' wine point out quite
correctly that fortified foods are nothing new. Salt has iodine.
Breakfast cereals are laced with vitamins. Maybe fortification of
wine with some of its most beneficial compounds is a natural
extension of that practice.
</P>
<P>
   But here's one key difference: Wine just happens to contain
alcohol, which a significant percentage of the population can't
tolerate safely and which can turn to poison if abused. Touting any
alcoholic beverage as beneficial medicine seems a bit, well,
tawdry.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason federal regulators have been so persnickety
about warning labels, only recently handing the wine industry a
half-a-loaf victory by approving two health-related labels
including, ``The proud people who made this wine encourage you to
consult your family doctor about the health effects of wine
consumption.'' The feds rejected suggested labels that referred to
``health benefits.'' I'll bet they were leery of those who would
seize upon the health angle to promote wines irresponsibly. Gosh,
that wouldn't happen, would it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm as excited as anybody about the recent research showing
health benefits of moderate wine consumption. But using that
information haphazardly will just threaten the wine industry's
common-sense efforts on wine labeling and will provide ammunition
to the anti-alcohol lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, why mess with a good thing?
</P>

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Somewhere in the world is the
secret headquarters of a powerful coalition of citizens who come
from all walks of life and yet share the single-minded goal to
prevent popular technological advances. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ I find it highly amusing that
Sheryl McCarthy, a columnist for Newsday, is all worked up about
the ``male sexual fantasy'' surrounding the Miss America Pageant.
Hey, lady, get a grip. The male sexual fantasy ain't watching some
18-year-old from Mississippi play ``Ode to Joy'' out of tune on a
French horn. If you ladies want to get your skirts in a knot about
who gets to enter the Miss America Pageant and who doesn't, don't
drag us guys into the argument. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.

<P>
   CERABINO-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Max Gordon is 90.
Mollie Levy is 82. And between them they have six children, 14
grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. But in Florida, their new
union is just another potential bad marriage, a marriage that needs
safeguarding by the Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act of
1998. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The dispatcher stayed on
the line for 11 minutes. Eleven long minutes. Through the thumping
up the stairs. Through his yells. Through her screams, shrill,
eerie shrieks that erupted from the depths of a frightened woman's
soul. She stayed on through the gunshots. ``Hello,'' she kept
saying. ``Hello. Hello. Hello.'' A domestic violence call. (Minor,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   BUYER'S-EDGE _ In metro Atlanta, it's hard to miss the car alarm
chorus. From flashing lights to honking horns to synthesized voices
stating, ``ARMED _ DISARMED,'' they've caught our attention. And
for good reason. According to the Highway Loss Data Institute
(HLDI), anti-theft devices reduce the risk of your vehicle being
stolen. Which means those noisemakers really do work. We take a
look at various kinds of anti-theft devices: how they work, what's
available and what they cost. 14 inch main story and lots of
breakouts. (Brooks, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. WITH PHOTOS.

</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-QUAKE-LESSONS (San Francisco) _ The Taiwanese quake may
have involved the same type of sinister fault that triggered the
Northridge earthquake in Southern California almost six years ago _
a ``blind thrust'' fault. These buried faults _ which cause
vertical ground motion _ lurk within the crust, unseen and
unpredictable. U.S. scientists hope to learn more about the
behavior of ``blind thrust'' faults by studying seismic data from
Taiwan. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-VULTURES (Merced, Calif.) _ Turkey vultures have
tightened their talons on a five-block stretch of one of the
busiest boulevards in this Central Valley town, generating a
neighborly conflict that could almost be described as agitated. By
MICHAEL DOUGAN.
</P>
<P>
   SF-MAYOR (San Francisco) _ With 14 candidates hoping to be San
Francisco's next mayor, it often takes something different,
ludicrous even, to get media coverage. Jim Reid rode a Muni bus
three days straight. Lucrecia Bermudez stormed a mayoral debate
with a bullhorn. Martin Eng, however, has decided to attack the
very organization he wants attention from. He has sued the San
Francisco Chronicle for ignoring him. By JULIE CHAO.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCE (``f'' categories)
</P>
<P>
   JOB-PROMOTIONS (San Francisco) _ When Hewlett-Packard recently
appointed Carleton ``Carly'' Fiorina as president and CEO, the move
symbolized two major trends in corporate America. Lost behind the
obvious one _ more women are gradually rising to the top _ is
another trend expected to have a huge impact over the next decade:
H-P directors weren't comfortable promoting one of their current
workers to CEO. They had to go outside the company. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   CAREERS-LONG-TERM (San Francisco) _ Getting bored in the job?
Look for things that inspire you and give you energy. They can help
you decide whether you're just temporarily out of breath or are so
wiped out that you should stop and run a different race. You can
draw energy from hobbies or spirituality or people you see every
day, like teachers and friends and family. By DAVE MURPHY.

<P>
   COSMETICS-ONLINE (San Francisco) _ Who ever heard of buying
cosmetics online? You can't touch them, smell them, try them. But
then, if you live in Helena, Mont., or somewhere in Guam, there
probably isn't a decent high-end cosmetics counter in sight to
purchase those delicious luxury goods that show up in Vogue, W and
Harper's Bazaar. What's a girl to do? Log on, of course. By CYNTHIA
ROBINS.

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)

<P>
   TV-SIMPSONS (Undated) _ ``The Simpsons,'' whose 11th season
premieres Sunday, may challenge the record of ``The Adventures of
Ozzie &AMP; Harriet'' as the longest-running sitcom ever, 14 years.
Creator Matt Groening said the comedy's durability can be traced
not only to the characters being well-drawn, but the fact they are
animation. ``In animation, at least the characters don't grow old.
Animation lends itself to novelty and surprise,'' he says. By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GROW-UP (Undated) _ It may prove too much of a task to
defend, even trumpet (though not too loudly) a sitcom that has a
dog named Mom who talks in subtitles. Then again, the guy behind
``Oh Grow Up,'' Alan Ball, is the same guy behind the new movie
``American Beauty,'' which has had many raves. ``Oh Grow Up'' has
the semiprecious distinction of being the second-best sitcom this
fall _ behind ``Action'' _ and primarily because virtually all
others are horrible. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-REVIEW-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ For fans of mysteries and
thrillers, fall is a joyous season because so many of the genre's
best writers are published in September, October and November. By
BOBBIE HESS.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   APPLES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Proclaimed our national fruit by Ralph
Waldo Emerson, the 19th-century poet and essayist, apples are a
wonderful mirror for what is regarded as American. For starters,
they are far more diverse than most folks imagine; there are more
than 7,000 varieties, with more being developed all the time. By
DOUG BLACKBURN.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS-KNEES (San Francisco) _ Maybe some genius will take a
break from the mounting dot-com dreck and figure out a way to make
and install artificial knee ligaments for the sport's
student-athletes. Think of it: super-strong, resilient knee
ligaments, made of some as-yet unknown material, capable of
withstanding the front bumper of a Lexus at 30 miles an hour,
attached to your favorite running back. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The Marin County Emergency
Operation Center recently held a Y2K drill. This was the New Year's
Eve disaster scenario, according to the Mill Valley Herald:
``Sharks are at Stinson, a riot's happening at the Mill Valley
Safeway, a tent has fallen on Huey Lewis, and foul-tasting oysters
at a millennium party have made hundreds of people deathly ill.''
By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   BROWNFIELDS (San Francisco) _ The Sierra Club took an unexpected
hit July 5, when it was called elitist in a full-page ad in the New
York Times. The Sierrans were predictably indignant. They claimed
to deserve better. It could have been worse. ``Racist'' and
``fascist'' also were kicked around by the militant young
copywriters at the Greenlining Institute, which bought the space
for the big-type screed. By SCOTT WINOKUR.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAM ALLIS   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ As brand names go, it is on par with
Coca-Cola. No other name in education carries its luster,
throw-weight, and global reach. From Cameroon to Kamchatka, people
know about Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Coca-Cola, Harvard has never exploited its name. It
has focused instead on its unrivaled community of scholars and
residential experience. Admission to its college or tenure on its
faculty draws from the elite of the elite. It practices the
politics of scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   On the millennial eve, the brand is like an untapped oil field.
``It is a global brand name without a global distribution system,''
says Susan Rogers, former chief technology officer of Harvard
Business School and now a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. The relentless growth of the Internet has driven
the institution to reexamine its mission and brand potential as
never before. Last spring, Rogers gave Harvard's provost, Harvey
Fineberg, a 75-page memo outlining five paths that Harvard might
pursue in cyberspace. They range from upgrading existing technology
to enhancing distance learning to creating a full-blown Harvard.com
business subsidiary to make large money from the university's
myriad educational products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, key administration officials and faculty
digested the Rogers memo. She was stunned by the response from this
crowd, known for its low comfort level with cyberspace. ``I thought
the reaction would be, `This really doesn't apply to us,' '' she
says. ``But I saw lightbulbs going off at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   The options are tempting. A Harvard.com would be easy to put
together. Ad agencies would kill for the opportunity to market it.
``They have a brand name that is the envy of every school
administrator in the world,'' says John Preis, chief financial
officer of Columbia Business School. And, adds Harvard Law School
professor Charles Nesson, ``Brand is everything in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   God knows, Harvard does not need the money. With a $13 billion
endowment, it is by far the richest university in the world. So
almost alone among academic institutions, it can decide its future
role on the Net based on mission, not money.
</P>
<P>
   Whither Harvard on the Net is the hottest question in the
administration these days. Fineberg, the point man for the
university on the subject, also chairs a 12-person Harvard Academic
Computing Committee, which is composed of legations from all of the
university fiefdoms to address these matters. The group, formed
last year, is not close to choosing a path for Harvard. And it
probably will never produce a white paper limning policy for the
entire university on the subject. The place doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has always been an astonishingly decentralized
conglomerate. ``Every polar bear his ice floe,'' is how John
Kenneth Galbraith once described its faculty. And its graduate
schools operate as muscular city-states. So by all accounts,
Harvard will shape its profile on the Net in a manner that some
will view as chaotic and others will place more charitably under
the rubric of ``let 1,000 flowers bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, says the school's general counsel, Anne Taylor,
the intellectual-property lawyers in her office will produce a set
of ground rules by which the deans must play. ``We know that if we
don't, it will be like living at the rodeo with a lot of cowboys
out there,'' she concedes. ``So we need to give them some
boundaries. But we won't be the architects.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Virtual Harvard challenge
</P>
<P>
   To understand Harvard's challenge is to recognize that the issue
is about mission, not technology. ``The questions are
technology-enabled,'' says Fineberg. ``But the answers are not
technology-driven. To think otherwise is a delusion and a strategic
error.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions are huge. Does Harvard dilute its incomparable
franchise by putting its teaching and research on the Internet?
Does it charge users for its Net content and, if so, how would
price be determined? In the words of psychologist Howard Gardner,
``What should Harvard not do? What line should the university not
cross? What is it that you don't give away?''
</P>
<P>
   At a gut level, does a virtual Harvard course detract from the
undergraduate degree for which parents take out third mortgages and
children herniate themselves to obtain? If, in short, someone can
take Harvard courses on the Net, why pay more than $30,000 a year
to go there in person?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Fineberg challenges the assumption that
exclusivity and quality go hand in hand. ``Does quality and
exclusivity equate one to the other?'' he asks. ``It's arguable.
Exclusivity is the wrong dimension of expression of quality of the
Harvard experience. If you read an excellent book, does it matter
that there are 100 or 100,000 copies?''
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg is understandably vague about what profile Harvard will
adopt in the for-profit world of cyberspace. While it is far too
early for Delphic utterances, he stresses that everything is on the
table. ``I rule nothing out now,'' he says flatly. ``The boundaries
between for-profit and not-for-profit are much more flexible than
they ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   One certainty will be the use of improved technology to enhance
existing programs _ continuing medical education at Harvard Medical
School for physicians, for example _ regardless of whatever else
Harvard does. This is one of the chief responsibilities of Daniel
Moriarty, who this month began the new job of assistant provost for
information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the consultant, thinks that Harvard will eventually take
significant steps into the Internet world, including creation of a
university-wide Internet portal through which a user could gain
access to data and programs from all of Harvard's schools as well
their distance-learning offerings. The university currently has an
informational Web site, Harvard.edu.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Harvard.com?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard does not suffer from apathy on the subject of life in
the cyberworld. Gardner, among many, abhors the specter of a
commercial Harvard.com, which he feels would be a cousin of the
corporate universities sprouting up across the country funded by
outfits like Pfizer Corp. ``I see nothing at all problematic about
transmitting for free what we've learned,'' he says. ``But what
would Harvard's answer be five years from now if its nonprofit
status is taken away because it's considered no different from
Disney?''
</P>
<P>
   And yet some of Harvard's duchies are already doing business on
the Net. The Harvard Business School Publishing Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of the business school, signed a contract two
weeks ago with a Denver-based outfit called eCollege.com to market
10 of its courses on the Internet. eCollege also put about 3,500 of
its case studies on the Net last year for the 130 colleges and
universities around the country it services.
</P>
<P>
   Business School dean Kim Clark says such projects are simply
extensions of the school's philosophy to spread its educational
product for the broader good since it started selling its famous
case studies in 1922. ``But we would not offer an on-line MBA
degree,'' he says, though he leaves the door open for other,
nondegree certification. ``We may well do that work,'' he adds.
``No question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clark will not allow, to answer Gardner's question, are
joint ventures using Harvard's name where control and quality would
be at risk. One recent example involved a large, very reputable
firm that wanted the business school to develop and administer a
program for its entry-level employees. ``You add up all the zeroes
and the money involved was a very, very large number,'' says Clark.
``But they were trading on our brand, and we said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Entreaties from companies seeking to exploit Harvard's name pour
in throughout the university. ``We have to beat them off with a
stick all the time,'' says Michael Shinagel, dean of continuing
education. ``They all want the brand name. Period. It's the coin of
the realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's richest branding potential falls under the category of
what Shinagel calls ``executive education,'' which includes
continuing learning for lawyers, doctors, teachers, public health
officials, and other professionals who need periodic
recertification in their fields. Americans will on average have six
careers in a lifetime, he points out, which means that
certification will become critical to their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Shinagel notes that continuing education in all of Harvard's 10
schools generated $160 million last year _ about 10 percent of
Harvard's overall budget. ``This will only increase as brand gets
more important,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an endocrinologist could receive a program tailored
to his or her specific needs, accessible on the Net at any hour,
instead of spending an expensive week in Hilton Head, S.C.,
attending a conference on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``You contrast that with the question whether Harvard should
offer a virtual MD program,'' says Moriarty. ``The question has
been raised if the med school should think about new degree
programs. It was a very short discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesson, the prime agent provocateur on cyberspace at Harvard,
along with his colleagues at the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society at the law school, favor an approach where Harvard content
is put on the Net gratis. But Nesson also wants Harvard faculty
members to benefit financially through marketing the textbooks and
material they produce to the huge audiences who would take their
courses on line.
</P>
<P>
   But that concept runs into a core control issue with the
university over how the spoils would be divided. ``We might run
into some troubles along those lines,'' he concedes. ``The
university could say, `We own your course.' That's the contest.
That's what people are thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for-profit, virtual universities like the University
of Phoenix are multiplying. New York University has spun off a
for-profit NYU Online Inc. to tailor courses to the training needs
of corporate clients. And a number of prestigious institutions are
marrying venture capitalists for their money. Most prominent,
perhaps, is UNext.com, a Chicago-based outfit of which mogul
Michael Milken owns 20 percent. UNext will transmit content onto
the Net from an academic consortium that includes Columbia,
Stanford, the University of Chicago, Carnegie Mellon, and the
London School of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is geared to business education, at least for now.
It expects to have its first course, in accounting, available early
next year, according to Preis of Columbia Business School, the arm
of that university that is participating with UNext. (Harvard
Business School was approached by UNext, according to Clark, but
rejected the offer to participate.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is often accused of being late to consider new trends in
education. In the case of cyberspace branding, Rogers asks, late
compared to what? None of the models that exist on the Internet
offer anything that Harvard wants to embrace. ``This is pre-Kitty
Hawk,'' she says. ``No one has figured out the model yet to be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harvard must identify threats from new players on the
education gridiron. Fineberg cites the code word for such dangers
that Intel founder Andy Grove uses with his troops: rebar. Rebar is
the low-grade steel used to reinforce concrete. The domestic steel
industry chose not to produce it, allowing the Japanese to gain
market share with it in this country. Today, America's domestic
steel industry is moribund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the University of Phoenix our rebar?'' Fineberg asks. ``I
know that Harvard has to change. No institution remains at the
forefront of its field if it does the same things in 20 years that
it does today.''

ISSUE OF WEB COPYRIGHT HOTLY DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this: A scientist spends years compiling
the world's largest book of poison antidotes. Then, shortly after
it's published, he turns on his computer to find a competing
researcher has photocopied the book, posted it to a Web page and
splashed it across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Legal? Yes, under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Preventable?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question perplexing Congress right now. The issue
extends far beyond the scientific community, affecting millions of
stockbrokers, librarians, real estate agents and publishers _
anyone who makes a living collecting information. Today, such
compilations, otherwise known as databases, go largely unprotected
by copyright laws that safeguard the interests of the authors and
publishers of creative works.
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, this had not seemed unfair: Databases, after all,
are generally gatherings of information created by someone else.
But the rise of the Internet has prompted heated debate over
whether those laws should change.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are tremendous within the $25 billion information
service industry: database owners fear they will lose huge profits
if outsiders can freely copy their information, while on-line
companies, such as Yahoo!, fear they could be run into the ground
if they can't easily trade in others' works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of restricting the availability of information in
the Information Age is a cause for concern to anyone interested in
the future of the Internet,'' said John Scheibel, a lobbyist for
Yahoo!, a portal site that allows Internet users to search the Web
_ and thrives off easily connecting users to databases around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have the most powerful computers, the most
sophisticated search engines and fully operative broadband systems,
but none of it will mean much without the information to flow over
those lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the debate is between people who collect raw
data and people who distribute it _ a dividing line that has grown
far deeper with the expansion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents, for example, gather information about which
apartments are available. Their concern is that an on-line
publisher could see their listings in the window of an agency, copy
them down, and put them up on a Web site _ all perfectly legal
under current federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis keeps vast collections of court decisions. They might be
faced with a competing on-line publisher who decides to use Lexis
data to launch a website of all court decisions from Massachusetts
_ also perfectly legal under copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone spend $2 million to create a database if it's
not going to be protected?'' said David Mirchin, of SilverPlatter
Information, a database publisher in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The issue resonates in Massachusetts, where academic
institutions and technology firms have lined up against database
publishing companies on opposite sides of the debate. It has also
split members of the Massachusetts delegation, four of whom sit on
the two House committees sparring over what role the federal
government should play.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, the Democrat who is the ranking
Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommitee, has sided
largely with the 70 groups that are pushing for easy access to
databases _ among them corporations such as AT&AMP;T and universities
such as Brandeis. What they want is legislation that would not
restrict people from copying databases unless they plan to use the
information in a directly competitive way.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern: restricting access could stifle the economy.
On-line stockbrokers, for example, worry that if Congress goes for
more restrictive copyright language, the New York Stock Exchange
would claim its stock quotes are part of a protected database. That
would allowing the NYSE to charge exorbitant licensing fees for
each stock price, dampening the enthusiasm of companies such as
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. or Bloomberg Financial Markets _ and,
opponents argue, giving the stock exchange a virtual monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers worry they would be forced to pay for
information that is currently free or inexpensive _ such a listing
of chemicals or a database of the elements. And Internet service
providers want to keep access to databases as free as possible, as
part of their strategy to encourage people to do business on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as part of e-commerce, as part of a network
economy,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors say that the less restrictive version of the
copyright bill has too many loopholes, and could sap the incentive
of those whose work is collecting raw data into extensive
databases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt is among those who sees database piracy as
a serious law-and-order matter. Congress' mission is to keep
companies from becoming ``victims of unscrupulous freeloaders who
can exploit their work with a click of a mouse,'' according to a
letter he co-wrote this month.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by virtually everyone on the House Judiciary
Committee. Along with Delahunt, fellow Democratic Massachusetts
Representatives Barney Frank and Martin T. Meehan also support the
stricter bill, which more closely resembles true copyright law.
People who copy information out of a database for commercial use
would have to clear it with the owner first _ just as people are
required to do now with newspaper articles or Broadway plays.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting whole sections out of, say, a consumer directory of
doctors' addresses to open a medical referral service would be
against the law. So would copying information to compete directly
with any owner of a database.
</P>
<P>
   The bill even raises the possibility of criminal sanctions
against database pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the push for stricter copyright regulations are some
major corporate and other interests: Reed Elsevier, owner of Lexis
Nexis and of Cahners Publishing of Newton, Mass; the American
Medical Association; and the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   All freely concede that their goal is to preserve their private
interests _ the profitability of the databases they collect. And
they see the potential threat as grave: Some advocates paint a
database doomsday scenario, in which whole databases are secretly
spirited away to the Internet, with no accountability for their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite example is Poisindex a database produced by
Micromedex, which does, in fact, list poison remedies for use in
emergency rooms. To date, the data has not been copied and posted
on the Internet. But if it were, ``there is nothing in the law that
would allow Poisindex to tell them to stop,'' according to Dan
Duncan, a lobbyist for the Software &AMP; Information Industry
Association. A parent browsing the Internet for poison remedies
would have no legal recourse if the pirated version of the index,
published without updates, revisions or accurate instructions, gave
outdated medical advice , he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, advocates of strict regulations say there have been
tangible consequences to the lack of database piracy laws.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Warren Publishing, a Washington-based company
that printed a three-volume book of US cable systems. Another
company copied the book and reissued it on diskette. Warren
Publishing took their competitors to court and lost at the appeals
level; they have since become among the most outspoken advocates of
tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally ripped off. It seemed to us an extremely
unfair decision. We invested hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year into producing this product, and the court basically
sanctioned'' its piracy, said Lynn Levine, assistant publisher for
research.
</P>
<P>
   Although Warren Publishing also reached a settlement with the
defendants, the case underscored database owners' worst fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is that producers of factual
compilations of information enjoy no general law protecting them
from piracy in the United States,'' Duncan said. ``If this
legislation does not go through, there will be much less quality
database information for users.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank agreed: ``I'm strong believer in the First Amendment, but
the First Amendment doesn't mean you have the right to publish
other people's work. I think there is a value to society of people
compiling databases. But if you get zero protection, why would you
do it? Data compilation is not fun. It's not something people do
for the sheer creative joy of it.''

COMPUTER MAY SOON REPLACE THE PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RACHEL COPPOLA   
 c.1999 Albany Times Union   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's been rotary and touch tone, cordless and cell and a pair
of Spaghetti-O's cans on a string. So what's next?
</P>
<P>
   It may sound strange, but the home computer is fast becoming the
telephone of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, users are booting up their personal computers and
making long distance PC-to-PC phone calls over the Internet for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they have to have a computer and Internet access,
which generally means paying monthly fees that can range from about
$10 to $50 for Internet access. But most users were doing that
already.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, some are attaching inexpensive Netcams and
communicating face-to-face with faraway friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   To start making phone calls and bypassing the usual
long-distance telephone charges, all you need is a decent
multimedia PC, a connection to the Internet (a 28.8K modem will do,
but 56K or cable modems are preferable) and a $10 microphone.
</P>
<P>
   For the most natural conversation it's also best to have a
full-duplex sound card in your machine and to wear headphones so
the person you're calling doesn't hear his voice echo back through
the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Once your hardware is in place, you and a friend simply need to
download an Internet telephony program off the Web and register
yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are many programs that are
completely free to choose from, including MediaRing Talk
(http://www.mediaring.com), FreeTel (http://www.freetel.inter.net/)
and NetMeeting (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeetinLine is
overdrawn g/), so you can experiment to see which has the best
voice quality and comes with the bells and whistles you desire.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites also feature detailed cyber instructions to help new
users install and operate software.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the best piece of advice for optimum results is to
make sure your computer meets the product's system requirements
before you start to download.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Buckley is the product manager of Professional Services at
VocalTec, which offers a telephony software called Internet Phone
(http://www.vocaltec.com). According to Buckley, telephony software
usage is increasing. Some 2 million people have downloaded Internet
Phone since VocalTec launched it in 1996, and currently about
450,000 people use it on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet Phone is not completely free users must
purchase the software for $50 after a free two-week trial period
Buckley said he's seen a tremendous growth in callers over just
three years, especially among those who want to reach out and
kibitz with family in distant places.
</P>
<P>
   As with any telephony software that relies on the Internet,
Buckley said, ``Voice quality can vary, depending on the network
that you're using.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio may be clear during one call, but online traffic jams can
produce packets of choppy sound that get delayed. However, Buckley
said, most people are willing to tolerate changes in a familiar
voice from call to call as long as it means saving a bundle on
their phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Those are Adnan Zia's sentiments exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Zia, who lives in Toronto, has been making long-distance phone
calls to Pakistan, Canada and the U.S. from his home computer for a
year now and he said he will continue using the technology as long
as it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Zia doesn't have any super-fancy, turbocharged hardware. He
makes his calls using ``an average Pentium PC'' that's almost a
year old and is hooked up to a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   He bumped into telephony technology while he was looking through
the different program files included in his Microsoft Office 97
suite and found NetMeeting, one of the first tele/videoconferencing
programs to appear on the scene, about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He then spoke to friends about it and learned they already had
been making computer phone calls for some time. A banner ad on a
Pakistani newspaper finally led him to the MediaRing Talk software,
which he thinks is the best program he's tested so far.
</P>
<P>
   To dial out with MediaRing, he simply clicks on a person listed
in his ``speed dial''-like drop-down menu. Other programs allow you
to type in a friend's e-mail address or his personal Web ``phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Zia usually sends an e-mail to his folks in Pakistan to
designate a convenient time to call, but impromptu calls are
welcome, too his computer will produce a light beep, and a dialog
box will pop up identifying who's on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaRing window resembles a floating cell phone on your
desktop and, like similar products, the software sports a slew of
useful features. A handy answering machine keeps a log of all
incoming calls and stores virtual ``Voizmail'' messages, while a
pop-up window for text-based chat is just a click away when the
Internet gets congested and calling clarity disintegrates.
</P>
<P>
   Zia said, ``It's a pretty cool software.''
</P>
<P>
   Behaviorally speaking, it seems impossible that generations will
ever be able to unplug the device they have grown up gabbing on,
slamming down and noodling around their fingers, but Internet
telephony and videoconferencing are pointing us down a new
technological road whether we're ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buckley, at least, they indicate the trend of the
future: convergence, where everything from phone to data to cable
TV will enter the home through the same pipeline and the quality of
voice and video via the Internet will start to improve.

HOW TO GET THE LOWDOWN ON GOOD AND BAD COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EDWARD IWATA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the digital culture zaps its way into nearly
every facet of our lives, it's no secret that the Web has evolved
into an awesome weapon for millions of investors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial information is power, and you can quickly nab those
factoids online for free or for a reasonable cost _ compared with
the millions of dollars that companies pay brokerages, investment
firms and research consultants for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the average investor can't tap into the same powerful
databases and pricy financial services as money managers and equity
analysts. But some sharp Main Street investors _ armed with
personal computers, tenacious brainpower and a wealth of online
resources _ know nearly as much about companies and stocks as the
Wall Street pros do.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an investment newbie or an online rookie, you may feel
bowled over by the thousands of financial resources on the Web.
Where do you begin? What are the best ways to get the lowdown on
good and bad corporations? What online tools are quick, handy and
helpful? Your first stop: the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the agency that enforces federal securities law, and
its Web site (www.sec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded corporations _ companies whose shares are bought
and sold on the stock exchanges _ must file financial statements
throughout the year with the SEC. If you can survive the numbing
legal and financial jargon, the reports often are gold mines of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Need a quick profile or snapshot of a company? Check out the
annual report given to shareholders or the 10-K report, an annual
report to the SEC, both of which give an overview of a company's
financial assets, market outlook, products and other big picture
topics.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how much top executives are making? Look up the
company's proxy statement for salaries, stock option packages and
other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Digging for dirt on a merger, bankruptcy or other big event that
will affect a company's stock or earnings performance by 5 percent
or more? Pore through the 8-K report, which companies must file
after a ``materially important'' event occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Want to invest in an IPO, a company's initial public offering _
its first sale of shares on the stock market? The prospectus will
give you a good overview of a private company about to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, researchers would have to dig laboriously
through reams of SEC documents in government or business libraries.
Or they'd call a company's investor relations office and have the
papers snail-mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you simply click to the SEC's Web site and find reports
rapid-fire on the EDGAR database. Ain't technology wonderful?
(EDGAR, by the way, stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval.) You also can check with several private firms _
including edgar- online.com, freeedgar.com and others _ that sell
SEC electronic filings for a fee. A company's complete SEC filings
and supplemental documents may not be on EDGAR, but the private
services will hunt it down for you.
</P>
<P>
   Next, get turned on to the best financial Web sites. If you
aren't addicted yet, get your fix fast _ the Internet and the stock
market aren't going away.
</P>
<P>
   The sites will help you probe a company's stock and financial
performance, call up business news stories and SEC documents, study
market sectors and the economy, set up your investment portfolio
and chat with other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want the scoop on IPO investing. While investment firms
dominate the IPO market, a small but growing niche of individual
online investors are getting a piece of the IPO pie.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to do a story on the new trend. To get a quick read on
IPOs, I clicked into CBS MarketWatch's financial news Web site
(www.marketwatch.com) and CNET's technology news site
(www.news.com/investor) to skim dozens of archived articles and
breaking stories on new offerings and tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then I did a broad Web search using various search engines,
punching in the key words ``IPOs,'' ``online'' and ``individuals.''
The search called up investment firms that specialize in IPOs for
online investors. I looked up their corporate profiles at
www.hoovers.com, the Web site of the venerable Hoover's corporate
directory, then zipped over to each firm's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A few keystrokes later, I clicked Raging Bull
(www.ragingbull.com), a popular high-tech investment site for day
traders, and posted a request on message boards to interview online
IPO investors. Within the hour, three investors had e-mailed or
called me.
</P>
<P>
   As I chatted with one investor on the phone, I used the SEC's
Web site and an investment research firm, www.ipomonitor.com, to
call up up summaries of IPOs he liked. I also searched several
other Web sites that follow the IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, all of that paper research would have taken
several days. With high-powered online resources, it took me only a
few hours. It's like leaping from a single-engine plane to a jet
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   So get started. Top financial portals include CyberInvest
(www.cyberinvest.com), ETrade Group (www.etrade.com), Excite
(www.excite.com), Go2Net's Silicon Valley Investor
(www.siliconinvestor.com), Investorama (www.investorama.com),
Microsoft's MoneyCentral Investor (investor.msn.com), Motley Fool
(www.fool.com), Yahoo! Finance (quote.yahoo.com) and others.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of superior news sites include ABCNews.com
(www.abcnews.go.com), Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com), CBS
MarketWatch.com (www.marketwatch.com), CNN's CNNfn (www.cnnfn.com),
Dow Jones Interactive (www.djinteractive.com) and TheStreet.com
(www.thestreet.com) and the Wall Street Journal's (www.wsj.com).
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, check out some excellent books on corporate and online
research. It may cost you a few bucks and give you paper cuts, but
the books carry thousands of hands-on research techniques.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet research tips, look into ``Competitive
Intelligence, Competitive Advantage'' (Abacus) by Michelle DeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're an online god, you're guaranteed to discover
dozens of new financial sites in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Another good study: ``The Irwin Guide to Using the Wall Street
Journal'' (McGraw-Hill) by Michael Lehmann, an economics professor
at the University of San Francisco. Not exactly light bedtime
reading but still a great guide to the Journal, the bible of
business journalism, whether the print or online edition.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also recommend ``The New Competitor Intelligence'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons) by Leonard Fuld, a business research consultant in
Cambridge, Mass., and ``Competitive Intelligence'' by Larry
Kahaner, a former BusinessWeek journalist.

'PRUDENCE, NOT PANIC' IS WATCHWORD FOR Y2K PREPARATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little more than 100 days left until the Jan.
1 deadline when computers might malfunction because of the
so-called Y2K bug, experts say individuals must join in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans can make responsible contingency plans to cope
with difficulties that might arise in early January, according to
Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Reform subcommittee, which monitors Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudence, not panic'' is his motto.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Y2K experts, Horn says each household should
prepare for possible disruptions in the delivery of electricity,
water, phone service or heat. While utilities and other companies
have made enormous progress in reprogramming computers and chips
embedded in equipment, no one can guarantee there won't be
scattered service breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream experts say Y2K tests show that significant problems
almost certainly can be fixed within 72 hours, so there is no need
for hoarding of water, food or cash. Even worst-case scenarios call
for only two weeks of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But while problems are not likely to be long in duration, even
one night without electricity in January can be dangerous unless
contingency plans are in place.
</P>
<P>
   By setting aside some water, fresh batteries, warm blankets and
nutritious foods that need no significant preparation, families can
protect themselves, according to the American Red Cross and other
relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And if Jan. 1 does pass quietly, as it will for the great
majority of Americans, then no harm will have been done. Households
with emergency supplies will be better prepared for the next
problem.

WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN THE MILLENNIUM NEARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans are checking off lists of things to do as they
prepare for possible Y2K problems. But a list of what not to do on
Jan. 1. is just as important.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T pick up the phone at 12:01 a.m. to wish loved ones a
happy new year. Phone companies say there's a limit to how many
receivers can get a dial tone at one time, regardless of
Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T run into the yard at 11:59 p.m. Dec. 31 to welcome 2000
by firing a gun. Every bullet that goes up must come down _
possibly into the skull of your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T stockpile gasoline. Fill your car's gas tank several
days before the year's end _ period. Keeping big containers full of
gasoline in the garage is an invitation to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T wait until 8 p.m. on Dec. 31 to go to an automated
teller machine for cash. If everyone waits until the final hours of
1999 to stock up on cash for the long weekend, the machines will
run dry and stir fears of bank failures. And don't keep large
amounts of cash in your home, vulnerable to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T invite hordes over for a New Year's Eve dinner and then
wait until 3 p.m. on Dec. 31 to buy your food and beverages. If
huge crowds pack into grocery stores on the last day of the year,
tempers could flare in long checkout lines and contribute to a
panicky feeling that night.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T make elaborate travel plans for the first few days of
January. Though airlines promise to be safe, no one can guarantee
that airport computers won't mix up reservations or that traffic
lights surrounding airports won't malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T fall for Y2K scams. Con artists are using Y2K to cheat
people out of their money. For example, some crooks pretend to be
bank officials calling people for personal financial information
``to conduct Y2K tests.'' Other shady organizations are touting
overpriced goods and services that are ``Y2K guaranteed.''

SOME DOOM-SAYERS SEE Y2K AS AN OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The threat of Y2K-related computer failures Jan. 1
is causing some Americans to prepare for an event so catastrophic
that society will break down and guns will be needed to protect the
money stuffed into the mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the alarmists insisting Y2K will trigger the
collapse of banks are working overtime to load up their own bank
accounts this fall. Profiteers are using Y2K pitches to peddle
``survivalist'' products such as guns, gold coins, dehydrated foods
and portable generators.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Y2K doomsayer is motivated by profit. Some sincerely
believe our technologically advanced society is in grave danger
from Y2K and that we should be preparing to live a much simpler way
of life. Still others are hawking Y2K hysteria to advance
ideological causes or fanatical religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the groups making the most out of the approach
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITEERS: These entrepreneurs are selling ordinary products,
but marketing them as something special for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gun World magazine warned that ``every family''
should prepare for Jan. 1 by owning ``at least two rifles.'' The
same month, the American Guardian, a journal of the National Rifle
Association, urged people to stock up on enough ammo to blast away
during ``a few weeks of severe social unrest.'' And Interstate Arms
Corp. of Billerica, Mass., is promoting the ``Y2K Limited Edition
Carbine'' with 30-round magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of gold medallions also are aggressive in exploiting Y2K
anxieties, telling consumers that gold will be the only
``currency'' with value after Jan. 1. Although gold prices have
been languishing at depressed levels, one company has been selling
gold at prices far above market value after stamping pieces of the
metal with images of religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are marking up the prices on simple products,
such as flashlights and freeze-dried foods, and marketing them as
``Y2K-guaranteed.'' Some con artists are using Y2K as a way to
trick gullible bank customers into disclosing personal financial
information, such as passwords for ATMs, to help with computer
``testing.''
</P>
<P>
   ARMAGEDDON BELIEVERS: Some fundamentalist Christians are
convinced that Y2K problems will trigger the rise of the Antichrist
and hasten the second coming of Christ. These groups encourage
adherents to stockpile food and water and develop survival skills
to prepare for this extremely turbulent time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the author of the book ``God's Free Harvest'' urges
Christians to prepare for Y2K by learning to live on acorns and
weeds. His book teaches readers how to ``use cattails for an
outdoor meal'' and ``make coffee from dandelion roots.''
</P>
<P>
   FORMER ``HIPPIES'': Some baby boomers who in their younger days
seriously questioned this country's economic system are now using
Y2K as a means to promote simplicity. Rather than stress the
survivalist approach of stocking up on guns and moving into
bunkers, these groups focus on building a sense of community,
urging people to grow vegetables in neighborhood gardens, can
foods, harness solar power and share other resources.
</P>
<P>
   HATE GROUPS: Some extremist groups believe Y2K could create the
social chaos needed to trigger a ``race war'' that will allow white
Christians to kill Jews, blacks and other minorities. They urge
adherents to use Y2K-related power outages and any subsequent store
lootings as excuses to start shooting.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVALISTS: Some people taking extreme steps to prepare for
Y2K, such as moving to remote farms with no electrical power, are
not racists, hippies or religious fanatics. They are simply
convinced that Y2K will trigger a cascade of equipment failures
that will cause power plants to crash, water spigots to run dry and
planes to fall from the sky.

TIME TO GET READY FOR POSSIBLE Y2K DISRUPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't panic, but get prepared.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's basic infrastructure will function after Jan.
1, authorities say the Y2K computer is sure to cause some problems.
The power could go out in one community, while the water system
falters in another and traffic lights could malfunction in still
another.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one can say with certainty which systems might fail,
``the basic message we are giving people is ...be prepared for an
emergency,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Leslie Credit.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the Red Cross always gives out that message,
so people should not be panicked by the arrival of the year 2000,
when some older computers might malfunction by reading the date as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what kind of disaster could happen,'' Credit
said. ``A big storm could hit at any time, or a chemical truck
could be driving through your area and turn over. We see Y2K as a
great opportunity to teach people about everyday preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and government agencies responsible for public
safety are fairly consistent in their advice about Y2K
preparations. For example, all urge consumers to assess the
particular needs of their households. A North Dakota farm family
with infant twins will have very different needs from a retired
couple living in a South Florida high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   Start your preparations by figuring out who is going to be in
your household between Dec. 31 and mid-January, and what each
person's special needs will be. Then lay out a strategy for making
sure everyone can stay hydrated, healthy and warm for up to two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the recommendations being made by mainstream
agencies:
</P>
<P>
   WATER
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Local providers typically keep water
flowing by using pumps and valves controlled by microprocessors and
chips. Computers also regulate various aspects of water treatment,
such as the addition of chlorine. In addition, Y2K-related power
outages could cause a loss of heat that would allow pipes to freeze
and burst.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store water for each member of the household,
based on an estimate of one gallon per person per day. Storing
water costs very little and is easy to do. Drinking water can be
drawn from the tap and stored in thoroughly cleaned plastic jugs
with tight lids. Don't use rust-prone metal containers or heavy,
breakable glass jugs. Don't fill the jugs to the limit in case the
water freezes and expands.
</P>
<P>
   Save water for bathing and flushing toilets in a large, clean
container such as a new garbage can or a water bed.
</P>
<P>
   Five-gallon containers are convenient and stackable, but don't
forget that water is heavy _ eight pounds a gallon. Filled
containers must be stored on very sturdy shelves or on the floor.
Water should not be stored where the temperature reaches above 100
degrees or below 32 degrees. Keep water containers out of direct
sunlight and away from chemicals, paints and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start saving cleaned 2-liter drink
containers and their lids. Find and clean containers that can be
used for storing washing water. Figure out where to safely store
your water and plan on filling the containers in November. Learn
where your house's main water shutoff valve is located and how to
operate it in the event of burst pipes.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Buying food at the grocery store may be
difficult in the first few days of January because of power
outages, traffic-light failures, or public transportation delays.
Also, you might need more food than usual in your home because of
delayed school or workplace openings.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store food for each member of the household, and
be sure to figure out whether you will have any special needs. For
example, will you need baby food for a visiting grandchild? Pet
food? Do you have children with peanut allergies?
</P>
<P>
   Your best choices will be canned and non-perishable foods that
are tasty and don't require refrigeration (in case of a power
outage) or cooking (in case the natural gas fails). So buy canned
tuna, fruits, long-lasting fresh vegetables such as carrots and
cauliflower, canned hams, peanut butter, crackers, fruit bars,
trail mix, cereals, powdered milk, granola bars, cookies, canned
beans and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It may be prudent to store an additional two weeks of
``emergency'' foods in case grocery prices shoot up in January
because of supply disruptions. For example, Y2K problems in Latin
America and the Caribbean could interrupt supplies of fruits and
vegetables, making them much more expensive. For your reserves,
have some dried fruits, as well as freeze-dried or dehydrated
products with very long shelf lives. Any products that you don't
use for Y2K will be on hand for future emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Create a clean, safe storage area
in your home and start putting canned and packaged foods there.
Mark the purchase date on the products so that you remember to eat
your oldest foods first (most foods off of the grocery store
shelves are good for six to 24 months).
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until December to start shopping. Prices may be
higher then because of Y2K stockpiling, as well holiday demand. A
few purchases each week over the next two months will be cheaper
and will let you avoid last-minute ``runs'' on grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   WARMTH
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Unfortunately, Y2K problems will be
hitting at the coldest time of the year. That means homes could get
very cold very fast in case of a loss of electrical power or
interruptions in the delivery of gas, coal or oil. A lack of heat
could be the most dangerous aspect of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Every household should have a source of heat that
does not rely on electricity or the delivery of fuel after
mid-December. Remember that in an emergency, you don't need to heat
the entire house, just an area big enough to keep household
members' teeth from chattering.
</P>
<P>
   For homes with working fireplaces, the solution may seem simple:
buy a cord of wood. But in many modern homes, fireplaces are
primarily decorative and allow most of the heat to go up the
chimney. Fireplaces with heat reflectors and energy-efficient
inserts keep rooms warmer. A wood stove, which puts out far more
heat, can be installed by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   But many people don't have a fireplace and don't want a wood
stove. For such households, a kerosene space heater can be used.
But remember, a kerosene heater cannot be operated in a small room
without ventilation. Heater manufacturers recommend opening a door
to an adjoining room or leaving an outside window slightly open.
</P>
<P>
   For cooking, you can stock up on cans of Sterno, which contain
jelled ethanol. A can will provide enough heat to warm a pan of
soup or make a cup of tea. An outdoor propane or charcoal grill can
work well for cooking _ as long as you keep it outside. A grill
used indoors can emit deadly fumes.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: If you have a fireplace, look into
purchasing a heat reflector or insert. Purchase a good-sized stack
of hardwood and find a dry place to store it. Get a non-electric
space heater if you need one and buy the fuel for it now. Learn how
to operate your heating source safely. Go to a camping goods store
and buy Sterno cans. Make sure the propane tank on your outdoor
grill is full.
</P>
<P>
   Also, have several fire extinguishers in the house, as well as
battery-operated smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Check your supplies of warm clothes and bedding. Make sure
you'll have enough sleeping bags, hats, quilts, and gloves for
everyone in the household.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Y2K problems could knock out electrical
power during the darkest time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Flashlights are by far the safest way to light the
night, especially in homes with children. Candles generally are not
a good idea because they have open flames and generate relatively
little light. Also, most candles are intended for decoration and
burn out quickly. Kerosene lanterns can be a little smelly, but
generate steady light.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Be sure you have plenty of
flashlights and fresh batteries. Each time you go to the grocery
store, pick up a few batteries so that you don't get hit with a big
cost in December.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL NEEDS
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Because of traffic problems created by
Y2K, it may be difficult to get to the doctor or pick up a
prescription in early January.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: People who need medications should get
prescriptions filled before mid-December. Schedule any elective
surgery before early December.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Schedule doctor appointments now
so that you can be sure your prescriptions are up to date. Think
about all of your health and body needs. For example, do you need
contact lens solution, tampons or vitamins? Be sure to have an
emergency medical kit with supplies such as bandages, antibiotic
ointments, hydrogen peroxide, a thermometer and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Although banks and other financial
institutions appear to be among the most Y2K-ready businesses in
the country, there is a potential for records to get mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Keep copies of your important financial records in
a dry, fireproof place. Your records should include insurance
policies, mortgage information, reports on Social Securities
earnings, investment records, employer 401(k) plans and all banking
records. Get a copy of your credit report. Keep records of all of
your ATM activities in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start organizing your paperwork
immediately. Submit a request for your earnings and benefits from
the Social Security Administration by calling 1-800-772-1213 or
going to the SSA Internet site (http://www.socialsecurity.gov).

OUTLOOK AS Y2K NEARS IS FOR ANNOYANCES, NOT CATASTROPHE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  With Y2K-PREPARE, Y2K-DOOM, Y2K-DO, Y2K-DONT 
By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
 &HT;    WASHINGTON _ The Paul Reveres of the Information Age will learn
in little more than 100 days whether their shouts have roused the
public from complacency about the Y2K computer bug.
 &HT;    On Jan. 1, Americans who go on their own midnight rides may see
traffic tie-ups, power outages and mass confusion stemming from the
date-related computer problem.
 &HT;    But increasingly, experts believe the alarms have spurred enough
action to prevent significant equipment failures in this country.
The progress is ``far more than I would have predicted,'' said Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
 &HT;    So while there are doom-sayers warning of apocalyptic failures
of power, transportation and military systems _ and many offering
to sell expensive forms of protection _ most experts advise
families simply to make the same preparations they would for a
severe winter storm.
 &HT;    Still, the people most familiar with the bug, including Bennett,
won't declare the coast clear. Many small and medium-sized
businesses, as well as state and local governments, have much more
work to do. And in many countries, especially in Latin America,
Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa, both businesses and governments
remain far behind in preparing for Y2K.
 &HT;    ``I am optimistic, but at the same time, I am absolutely certain
there will be Y2K incidents,'' Bennett said.
 &HT;    The question no one can answer is whether the expected computer
malfunctions involving smaller companies and overseas suppliers
will be great enough to disrupt the supply chains that keep the
U.S. economy humming.
 &HT;    Optimists say our economy is so strong that Y2K troubles won't
have a measurable impact. If one supplier shuts down because of
computer problems, another company with better equipment will
quickly take its place, they argue. Indeed, the economy will get a
boost as Y2K weeds out technologically trailing companies.
 &HT;    But pessimists fear that Y2K could cause a cascade of small
failures that will build into big collapses of computer-controlled
systems and global supply chains, triggering a worldwide recession.
 &HT;    What remains disconcerting so late into 1999 is that no one can
predict with total confidence what will happen just 103 days from
now.
 &HT;    The roots of this problem can be traced back to the 1960s, when
mainframe computers began entering our workplaces. Early
programmers decided to use two digits to denote a year. For
example, 65 would represent 1965.
 &HT;    The dating system continued through the 1970s and 1980s, both in
software and the embedded chips that controlled computers and
automated equipment.
 &HT;    As long as computers were working with dates in the 1900s, the
digits created no problems. But many of these older programs have
no way of recognizing dates in 2000 and beyond.
 &HT;    This might seem an almost trivial problem, but the complications
can be enormous.
 &HT;    A bank's computer software might think a customer had been
saving money since 1900 and was owed a century's worth of interest
payments. An automated elevator's embedded chips might think it has
not been inspected since 1900 and shut itself down.
 &HT;    Fixing Y2K problems already has cost the federal government more
than $8 billion, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office.
Industry is spending tens of billions more.
 &HT;    If Jan. 1 passes quietly, it will not be proof that Y2K was all
hype or hoax, but rather that businesses ``recognized the problem
and addressed it with the right resources,'' said Tom Orlowski,
vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 &HT;    Despite these expensive efforts, experts are reluctant to
declare victory over the Y2K bug. That's because many computers and
chips are physically inaccessible, making it impossible to test
them. The chips in satellites in outer spaces or in drilling
equipment beneath the ocean's surface can't be guaranteed to work
properly on 1-1-00.
 &HT;    Also, so much effort has gone into fixing the most crucial
computers that smaller problems may have been ignored. A good
example of that turned up recently when the Social Security
Administration mailed letters to more than 32,000 people announcing
that certain benefits would end on Jan. 1, 1900.
 &HT;    The agency, which had been bragging for months about its success
in fixing the ``mission-critical'' systems responsible for cutting
checks, admitted it had not repaired the machine that printed the
letters.
 &HT;    Both optimists and pessimists point to the Social Security
incident to support their arguments.
 &HT;    Optimists admit that odd problems will occur, but nothing that
would necessitate hoarding food or pulling all your money out of
the bank.
 &HT;    But pessimists say the letter shows the bug is so pervasive that
even the powerful federal government cannot stop it. On Jan. 1,
they warn, so many computer errors will occur at once that chaos
could break out.
 &HT;    The worst-case scenarios go something like this: Shortly after
midnight Jan. 1, Y2K bugs will cause the power to go out in a
number of cities. Many telecommunications systems will falter
because the chips embedded in satellites and other kinds of
equipment will fail. In a few cities, explosions will light up the
skies over chemical plants. In poorer countries, nuclear power
plants will begin spewing dangerous materials into the environment
and millions of people will start freezing to death in cold places
like Russia and North Korea.
 &HT;    News stories about the explosions and power outages will cause
people everywhere to panic, triggering bank runs, food shortages
and looting. Y2K problems in other countries will be so severe that
U.S. manufacturers will be unable to get parts, causing massive
layoffs.
 &HT;    A year ago, that scenario seemed to have more credibility. But
today, mainstream thinking is much less grim. Most information
technology officials say the problems that will occur in this
country will take no more than 72 hours to fix.
 &HT;    A three- to four-day estimate for disruptions has become the
norm among leading experts on Y2K. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
vice-chairman of the Y2K committee, is urging Americans to have 72
hours worth of food, water, medicine and warm clothing ready, just
in case problems strike in their areas.
 &HT;    But he hastens to point out that stockpiling food or cash for a
long haul would be more dangerous than doing nothing, because it
could cause bank runs or stampedes to stores.
 &HT;

`DIGITAL STORAGE LOCKER' FOR MUSIC DOWNLOADS  
 A NEW WEB SITE OFFERS TO FIX THINGS WITH THE JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an increasingly popular Internet activity: downloading,
storing and playing digital music files on a computer or a portable
player that can handle the MP3 digital music format.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be annoyingly difficult: Users often do not pay
attention to where downloads land on their hard drives _ and since
there is no industry-wide convention for naming music files, a song
might arrive as a file called eleanorrigby.mp3 or, more blindly,
977X021.mp3. As a result, finding the downloaded tunes can be a
scavenger hunt _ especially on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting a potential business opportunity, two executives with
Internet start-up experience and venture capital have set up a
Silicon Valley company called Myplay. Its Web-based service,
planned for a mid-October rollout, is meant to make it easier to
download and organize music files by song title _ with artist and
album also listed, if Myplay has the information in its database.
Each user's files would be kept in a personal ``digital storage
locker'' on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other than offering a sample starter kit of some 100 licensed
songs from an eclectic repertoire that includes Elvis Costello and
George Gershwin, Myplay assumes that users will obtain their own
music files on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A user would have access to the storage locker from any computer
connected to the Internet _ similarly to the way Microsoft's
Hotmail and other Web-based e-mail services enable a person to
check e-mail from any computer, rather than being tied to a single
desktop or laptop machine.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Camplejohn, the 34-year-old co-founder and chief executive
of Myplay, is a former Apple Computer marketing executive. His
cofounder, David Pakman, 30, is a former Apple colleague who was a
business development executive at the online music distributor N2K,
before it merged with CD Now earlier this year. The company, which
is based in Redwood City, Calif., and whose financial backers
include the Silicon Valley venture firms IVP and Interval Capital,
plans to offer each customer a free storage locker that could hold
250 megabytes _ some five to six hours _ of music.
</P>
<P>
   While Myplay may eventually sell monthly subscriptions for
additional storage space, the company's main revenue would come
from advertising and from marketing agreements with music companies
like Dreamworks Records, a unit of Dreamworks SKG, that has signed
on as a charter advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Somers, a marketing executive with Dreamworks Records, said
his company would offer individual tracks to Myplay customers,
including one from the band Powerman 5000. People who downloaded
the Powerman 5000 track might then receive promotional e-mails
about the band's albums, concerts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of finding out what people are listening to,''
Somers said. ``It's another aspect of one-to-one marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ TIM RACE

<P>
   A New Web Site Offers to Fix Things With the Judge
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not called Misdemeanors.com, but it might well be.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with Web sites devoted to selling just about any
conceivable type of goods or services, it appears that the next
frontier for entrepreneurs is using the Internet to help people pay
their debts to society.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is the theory behind Govworks.com, a New York
company that will let people pay fines for traffic tickets and
other petty violations by entering their credit-card numbers and
the summons information at its Web site. It will begin testing the
system next month in 10 cities, including Springfield, Mass., and
Stamford, Conn. By the end of the year, it plans to serve people
who have committed misdemeanors in the 3,000 largest cities in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend more money on Class C misdemeanors than on
music,'' said Kaleil Izaza Tuzman, 27, the company's Colombian-born
founder, who came up with the idea while working as an arbitrage
trader at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Class C misdemeanors include parking and traffic violations and
other offenses like public indecency, although Govworks will not
handle fines for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Govworks will charge a 5 percent transaction fee for each fine
paid.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more! Violators who sign up for a magazine
subscription, apply for a credit card or get an auto insurance
quote at the site will pay no fee and will even get a $5 or $10
reduction on their ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzman says the company will be much more than a time-saver for
scofflaws. The company hopes to automate other civic transactions
like tax payments, surplus-property auctions and
purchasing-contract requisitions. And it will list all manner of
information generated by local governments, from job listings to
video replays of city council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The company has attracted $15 million in investments from
Silicon Valley's Mayfield Fund, the New York City Investment Fund,
Hearst New Media and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Govworks does not need a city's cooperation to act as a fine
collector, because it can simply mail a check like any electronic
bill-payment service. But ultimately its founders hope that cities
will agree to accept electronic payments and to pay for various
additional services.
</P>
<P>
   Govworks says it has no plans to work with corrections
departments or their hard-core clientele. Any takers for
Felonies.com?

PLAN CALLS FOR SELF-POLICING OF THE INTERNET

 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents who want to shield their children from pornographic,
violent or other harmful material in the mass media are used to
relying on industry ratings for guidance about movies and video
games. But when it comes to the Internet, they are on their own _
or left to rely on commercial blocking programs that function as
censors rather than guides.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an ambitious proposal drawn up by a German policy research
group and based largely on the ideas of an American First Amendment
scholar urges the creation of an international rating and filtering
system for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is included in a set of recommendations for how the
Internet industry could police itself to stave off regulation by
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing the industry can do is adopt a system that
allows parents, who choose to, to decide to filter things for their
children,'' said Jack M. Balkin, an architect of the plan and a
professor of constitutional law and the First Amendment at Yale Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the proposal has received a cool reception from
civil libertarians and some major Web publishers who argue that the
plan could backfire and chill free speech online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being put forward as an effort to prevent regulation
of content, but there is a very good possibility it could end up
inviting official censorship,'' said David L. Sobel, general
counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington-based civil liberties group.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, nine months in the making, was written by the
Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit group associated with the
German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG. It was introduced on
Sept. 10 at a meeting in Munich sponsored by the foundation and
attended by about 300 government officials, scholars, Internet
industry representatives and civil libertarians from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a lengthy Memorandum on Self-Regulation of the
Internet that suggests a number of steps businesses could take to
protect children from harmful material on line, including the
development of industry codes of conduct to be enforced by
self-regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the part of the proposal that has drawn the most fire from
free speech advocates is the suggestion that the industry develop a
global voluntary rating system that parents could use with
filtering software to block content.
</P>
<P>
   The Bertelsmann memorandum likens its proposal to a
three-layered cake. On the first layer, Web publishers around the
world would voluntarily describe their sites using a standard set
of terms drawn up by an independent, nonprofit organization. At the
second layer, organizations representing a range of backgrounds and
viewpoints would devise rating systems to evaluate the terms
according to their values, spawning variety of filters reflecting
different ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   The third layer refines the scheme by allowing, among other
things, the creation of ``white lists'' of approved sites that may
have been unreasonably filtered out _ for example, news sites that
might otherwise be blocked because news can be of a violent nature.
Parents could choose to block children's access to unrated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Waltermann, deputy head of the media division of the
Bertelsmann Foundation, argues that the proposed system, with its
heavy emphasis on parental choice, could discourage governments
from intervening in content regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But others see dangers in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, like the American Civil Liberties Union and other free
speech advocates, fears that the system could invite government
regulation. For one thing, governments might require sites to rate
themselves, perhaps even imposing sanctions on those that mis-rate
their content, he said. And, he added, less democratic governments
might use the system to filter what citizens see.
</P>
<P>
   Others express the fear that self-rating would invite
self-censorship. ``If you know you are rating for a particular
level of violence or other content, you may try to jigger a story
so a wider audience could watch it,'' said Arthur B. Sackler, vice
president for law and public policy at Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Barr, editor at large at the online publisher Cnet
and co-chairman of the Internet Content Coalition, a group of Web
publishers that includes The New York Times, said that while the
white lists are supposed to act as a brake on unreasonably filtered
sites, he was nervous about the idea of someone defining news.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a bona fide news site?'' Barr asked. ``The New York
Times? Nudist news? Matt Drudge? Who's to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan say such fears are either unfounded or
addressable.
</P>
<P>
   Balkin says the self-censorship argument is overstated, in part
because it is reasonable to expect producers of children's sites to
create age-appropriate material, and the proposed system would not
bind adults. As for defining what constitutes news, he says, a
variety of news white-lists could describe a range of news types.
</P>
<P>
   Balkin also argues that even totalitarian governments may be
unable to use the system to censor content, because ratings would
not describe political viewpoints and technology could be developed
to route around censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, says Waltermann of the Bertelsmann
organization is the threat of government regulation. ``If
governments feel that there are no ways for parents to make choices
in their own homes,'' he said, ``they could do all kinds of
horrible things to make sure people don't have access.''
</P>
<P>
   George Vradenburg, senior vice president for global and
strategic policy at America Online, says the Bertelsmann proposal
lends an ``an intelligent and thoughtful voice'' to the discussion
of ratings and controls. He added, however, that he had misgivings
about a global rating system, fearing, like the civil liberties
groups, that it could invite government mandates.
</P>
<P>
   The most appropriate place for Internet ratings, he says, may be
in those categories of content where parents are accustomed to
seeing them in the off-line world _ in movies, games and television
shows that migrate to the Web.

NEW HARDWARE COULD HELP WEB MERCHANTS CUT FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit card companies love the Internet, since they pocket a
share of most e-commerce transactions. But like everything in the
world of revolving credit, that love has limits. Stolen cards used
to make purchases online, in particular, cost credit card issuers
millions each year _ pushing the price of doing business on the Web
higher for banks, merchants and, ultimately, users.
</P>
<P>
   So even as the major credit card companies and the banks that
issue those cards explore ways to build Internet market share, they
are also looking for creative ways to limit fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The recent launch of the American Express blue card, which comes
with an embedded computer chip, is an example of both efforts.
Since the card's chip can access a user's personal information, it
will eliminate the hassle of typing in that data in every Web
purchase _ and, American Express hopes, encourage people to use its
card. At the same time, the chip limits the fraud by guaranteeing
the shopper's identity and offering greater protection to the
buyer's information during the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The key to these features is a piece of computer hardware that,
until now, has been foreign to the desktop: a credit card reading
device. Starting in November, blue card owners will be able to
obtain such a device, which they will be able to plug into their
PC's, enabling them to swipe the card at home much like a sales
clerk would at a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   Other credit card issuers are exploring similar technologies.
One company that makes a card-reading device for personal
computers, UTM Systems (www.utmsystems.com), recently announced
that four major U.S. banks affiliated with both Visa and Mastercard
International will begin distributing its system free to consumers
before the end of the year. UTM's founder and chief executive,
Robert Lee, declined to name the banks, but said they served ``well
over 10 million customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The device, which costs the card issuers $6 a unit, is simple.
When a user is ready to make an online purchase, the credit or
debit card is placed in the UTM card reader, which is inserted into
a floppy disk drive. A small window then appears on screen, asks
for a personal identification number and sends the encrypted
information to the retail site. When the transaction is complete,
the window disappears.
</P>
<P>
   David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card
industry newsletter, predicted that credit card companies would be
aggressive in spreading such technologies. ``American Express is
the first, but you'll see everyone start to do this by the end of
the first quarter of next year,'' he said. ``It's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of fraud prevention, card issuers have great
incentive to promote the devices, he said. Issuers lose roughly 8
cents for every $100 in online sales to fraudulent card use _
``slightly higher than the market at large, but it's growing,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been fabulously successful at pushing fraud
down in general,'' he added. ``But that just highlights the
liability associated with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Visa, American Express and Mastercard
are stepping lightly into the electronic frontier. Each has begun
major Internet-related advertising efforts, of which Visa's is the
most aggressive. According to the Nilson Report, 59 percent of
Internet credit card purchases are made with Visa, 28 percent with
Mastercard and 12 percent with American Express. Off line, Visa has
a 51 percent share, compared with 25 percent for Mastercard and 17
percent for American Express.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the success of PC-based credit card readers hinges on
how secure consumers feel about credit card transactions on the
Web. While such devices in fact provide users more security than
typical Internet transactions, surveys indicate that consumers are
less concerned about entering their credit card data online than
they used to be. One recent survey by Navidec, a consulting firm,
indicated that 21 percent of Internet users worry about credit card
security during transactions, about half the number that expressed
such concerns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paul Hughes, an analyst with the Yankee Group
consulting firm, says that new Internet users might warm to these
devices, given the trepidation with which many still approach
online shopping in general. ``That said, the credit card companies
are going to have to do some creative marketing to drive these into
the hands of consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one online merchant is leery of such creativity. ``If
credit card companies say that only with this device is a
transaction secure during transmission, that would be a disservice
to e-commerce as a whole,'' said Peter Baltaxe, senior vice
president of 911Gifts.com. ``I don't know of a single documented
case of a credit card number being taken in transit.''
</P>
<P>
   If credit card companies succeed in spreading the gospel of
card-reading devices without scaring consumers, it could help the
cause of e-commerce merchants, who have gone to great lengths to
reduce fraud in recent years. Internet retailers have cut the rate
of fraud from as much as 15 percent of online transactions earlier
in the 1990s to roughly 2 percent today, but given the difficulty
of achieving a profit online, that figure still rankles executives.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is the premium Web merchants pay in
credit card transaction fees because of the higher risk of fraud
associated with online purchases. The biggest Internet-only
retailers can negotiate transaction fees of roughly 2 percent,
which are competitive with off-line retailers, but most e-commerce
sites pay at least 1 percentage point more _ often 3.5 percent.
Such purchases _ so-called ``card not present'' transactions in
industry parlance _ are deemed riskier because the retailer cannot
physically match the credit card with the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Card-reading devices would presumably solve that problem, since
they insure the identity of card holders by requiring them to enter
a personal identification number. ``Would we like to have fees
reduced, seeing that we're always dealing with the card-not-present
issue?'' said Elaine Rubin, chairman of Shop.org, an e-commerce
trade group. ``Clearly we'd love that. Is that going to happen?
It's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Both American Express and Visa representatives agreed. ``We
would have to look at the entire value proposition'' before
reviewing online merchants' transaction fees, said Michael
Biendorff, who heads Visa's recently formed Evisa unit. ``Right now
it would be premature to speculate.''

WEB SITES OFFER A NEW LURE FOR WRITERS: WEALTH ON PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and COREY KILGANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casting about for ways to raise its profile, Nerve.com, a
little-known Web site billing its contents as ``literary smut,''
last week sent out come-ons to 60 of the country's best-known
writers, from Joyce Carol Oates to John Updike, offering them not
just $2 a word for their contributions, but a package of stock
options in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Options, the speculative scrip given mythic status by the
success of some Internet start-ups, are seeping into the literary
and journalistic world, as Nerve.com has taken its cue from Web
sites like Salon and TheStreet.com, both of which have used stock
options to lure or reward freelance talent.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Nerve.com is still romancing venture
capitalists, and a long way away from an initial public offering or
acquisition _ events that would eventually give the options
whatever bankable value they may have. Rufus Griscom, 28, who is
Nerve's editor in chief and chief executive, boasts that ``next
week we will have a Pulitzer Prize-winner'' committed to write for
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Griscom's effort to find a name-brand literary asset to call his
own _ and subvert the economics of the freelance writing business _
comes as name-brand writers are slowly turning up on the Web. David
Talbot, the editor of Salon, the San Francisco-based Webzine, has
Garrison Keillor and Camille Paglia as regular contributors. He
said that he had offered stock options to about 10 of Salon's
best-known freelance writers and illustrators _ but would not say
which.
</P>
<P>
   The options in Salon, which offered stock to the public in June
for an initial price of $10.50, allow recipients to purchase Salon
shares for $1 or less in most cases, said Todd Hagen, Salon's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have used options for consultants and contractors for
years,'' Hagen, who has handled the financial affairs of Web
companies and software companies, said. ``The concept of using
options isn't unique. What is unique is that we as a media company
are doing it with columnists and freelancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Moore, publisher of Slate.com, an online magazine owned by
the Microsoft Corp., said he had not heard of the practice of
offering stock options to freelancers. ``There are plenty of
fantasy stories of people hitting it rich off Internet stock option
payments,'' Moore added. ``But these offerings could be completely
worthless, too.'' For Slate, he said, it would make little sense _
the magazine is owned by Microsoft, making the currency of options
too valuable for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the writers who received the offer from Nerve also said
it made little sense to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't write for the Web,'' said Joyce Carol Oates.
``I'm not a Web person.'' Gay Talese said: ``I don't know why this
would have any appeal. It has no appeal to me.'' He said he thought
such a speculative deal ``would have a one in 10,000 chance of
working out.''
</P>
<P>
   John Updike said he had not yet received Nerve's offer, adding,
``I probably would not have responded anyway.'' He added, ``Young
writers may be willing to gamble writing for stock options, but at
my advanced age, I prefer to get paid in dreary old cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach of Nerve, Salon and TheStreet.com has its parallels
in other Web ventures. In May, Atomfilms.com, a privately owned
online film distribution company, which buys licensing rights for
independent short films, began offering artists stock packages
along with cash payment for licensing rights to their films, said
Heather Redman, senior vice president of business affairs for
Atomfilms.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be the reason an artist chooses us,'' Ms. Redman
said. ``It's more like this is something to put in the back of your
underwear drawer and pull out if we make it big one day. There
really isn't any worth to it until we go public or we're
acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Alanis Morissette, the rock singer, received a stock
package payment from MP3.com, an Internet company that posts
recordings for free downloading by users. Ms. Morissette agreed to
endorse MP3.com, allowing the site to post exclusive photographs
from her current tour. In return, MP3.com agreed to help sponsor
the singer's tour and to pay a total of 436,000 shares, roughly 2
percent of the company, to Ms. Morissette and Atlas/Third Rail, an
entertainment company in which hger, Scott Welch, is a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they couldn't pay us in the traditional sense,''
Welch said. ``So we took a handshake and the stock. We didn't know
what it would be worth, but it didn't hurt that the deal was in all
the papers with Alanis' picture next to it.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com went public on July 21 at $20, and its value soared,
closing the first day of trading above $63. Since then it has
retreated, closing last Friday at $32.625. But that still makes the
stake owned by Ms. Morissette and Welch worth a total of $14.2
million. Welch declined to discuss how soon the two are entitled to
sell some or all of those shares.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stock-for-words deals are not entirely unprecedented. In 1953,
when Hugh Hefner was putting together the first issue of Playboy,
he persuaded more than half the contributing illustrators and
writers to accept stock in lieu of cash for their work.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 Playboy magazine article, Hefner quoted one early
Playboy writer, Burt Zollo, who accepted 100 shares of stock, as
saying, ``I sold it the first day it was traded and became a
millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weber, the editor in chief of The Industry Standard, a
magazine focusing on Internet commerce and culture, said he
believed the phenomenon of options payments would not last. ``I
would be surprised if it were the beginning of a trend,'' he said.
``It's very much driven by the current hype about options.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not there when the options are passed out, he
added, may not be missing much. ``Most people who get stock options
do not get rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, editor of TheStreet.com _ in which the New York
Times Co. has a minority stake _ offered options to some key
freelance contributors earlier this year, before The Street.com
made its initial public offering in May. ``It's a good way to
reward important contributors and it's a good way to make sure they
stick with you over the longer term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, the chief financial officer at Salon, said that most of
the options offered its writers vest _ meaning that the freelancers
gain legal title to the options _ in stages over a four-year
period, beginning one year after the initial offering last June.
The stock is currently trading at $6.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis, a contributor to several magazines, including The
New York Times Magazine, has written about his decision to turn
down The Street.com's offer of a 2.5 percent stake a few years ago
in return for writing a weekly column.
</P>
<P>
   The illogical speculation in Internet stocks has created its own
logic, at least temporarily, Lewis said in an interview. ``For this
brief moment, perceptions are creating their own reality,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griscom is only too happy to peddle his perceptions. ``Everyone
knows people are making a huge amount of money off these Internet
companies and they want to participate in that,'' he said. He
added, ``The only way we can make a more generous offer than a New
Yorker or a Vanity Fair is to offer fat stock options packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it all last? Lewis said he doubted it. ``There will be
astonishing aspects of capitalism in the near future,'' he said.
``But this particular astonishing aspect won't last. I don't think
it's sustainable for journalists to become millionaires, unless
they cease to be journalists. I don't think they are that valuable
economically. Culturally they're valuable, but not economically.''

SURFING THE HUMAN GENOME: DATA BASES OF GENETIC CODE ARE MOVING TO 
THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it an end-of-the-century business case
study.
</P>
<P>
   Pangea Systems Inc. is a small but leading company in
``bioinformatics,'' a hot new field that combines the two keystone
technologies of the 1990s _ computing and biotechnology. But its
products are expensive and difficult for mortals to use, which
limits Pangea's potential market and reduces the prospects for a
public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? This being 1999, the answer if you are Pangea is to
dot.com yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This week Pangea, which is based in Oakland, Calif., intends to
begin a shakedown test of DoubleTwist.com, a new Web site intended
to make online genetic and biological research fast, easy and
available to any amateur or professional biologist. While the test
phase is available only to faculty and students at Stanford
University, the site is scheduled to go live for general use in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The DoubleTwist site, whose name is a play on the double-helix
structure of DNA, holds the near-term promise of lifting Pangea
above the pack of competitors chasing the business opportunities in
bioinformatics. But other companies may not be far behind. And the
implications go beyond the interests of professional biologists and
biotechnology executives.
</P>
<P>
   As more of the arcane secrets of genetics and molecular biology
become available to the modemed masses, some industry executives
foresee the day when an educated consumer might take a CD-ROM
containing a laboratory's rendering of his or her genetic profile,
and combine it with a Web surf through gene libraries to determine
the person's predisposition toward adverse drug reactions, for
example, or for Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer or other
afflictions that might eventually be treatable through gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   To promote its name and capabilities, Pangea plans to let
individuals who make only casual use of the site have access to its
software and data base at no charge. Heavy users and corporations
may obtain licenses to pay for access on a sliding fee scale _
which could run tens of thousands of dollars a year, but would
still be significantly less than the $500,000 or more that Pangea
now charges big pharmaceutical companies to buy its software
outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of bioinformatics has been somewhat limited to those
who could afford it,'' said John Couch, Pangea's president and
chief executive, who was an executive at Apple Computer in the late
1970s and early 1980s. ``I've been trying to figure out how to
empower the scientist the way we did computer users at Apple in the
early days,'' Couch said. ``We saw the opportunity to be the first
Web portal that enabled scientists to do molecular research.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera Genomics Group is another company that has said it will
offer its bioinformatics tools from its Web site, although it has
not specified a launch date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an Internet company,'' said Craig Venter, president
and chief executive of Celera, a unit of the PE Corp., which is
based in Rockville, Md. Scientists and nonscientists alike, he
said, will be able to use Celera's tools to gain insights into
their genetic makeup. And as catalogs of common mutations
correlated with disease become broadly available, he said,
individuals will be able to make appropriate lifestyle changes or
health-care decisions. ``You'll be able to log on to our data base
and get information about yourself,'' Venter said. ``Our ultimate
customer on the Internet is individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioinformatics is a field that emerged from the Human Genome
Project, the international quest _ which began in 1988 and is
expected to be concluded in the next two years _ to spell out the
precise sequence of the three billion letters in the human genetic
code. The first industry spawned by the genome project was genomics
companies, which sell data bases of individual genes whose
sequences have already been identified or are developing drugs
aimed at gene targets. As these efforts began to produce vast
amounts of biological information, they needed powerful software to
keep track and make sense of it all. And so, in the early 1990s,
bioinformatics was born as a tool of genomics.
</P>
<P>
   While the software created by the government-funded labs like
the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is in the public domain, with intriguing names like
Blast and Fasta, the genomics companies, like Human Genome Sciences
Inc. and Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., have kept their tools for use
by themselves or their licensed partners. That is Celera's primary
business as well, despite Venter's intent to offer bioinformatics
services on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before a few entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists saw an opportunity in a pure-play bioinformatics
company, which would sell not genes or data, but software. As
private companies, none of the bioinformatics players publish
revenue figures, but most say they are between $5 million and $10
million in annual sales, and growing. Indeed, some analysts predict
a multibillion-dollar bioinformatics market within the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioinformatics is not necessarily the next wave, but the glue
that holds everything together,'' said Tim Wilson, an analyst with
S.G. Cowen. ``If you don't get that part right, it's hard to
realize the value of genomics,'' he said. ``The opportunity is
something obvious to anyone who speaks to pharmaceutical
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   With the DoubleTwist site, according to Pangea, a researcher
would have many of the same capabilities previously available only
to the company's big corporate customers, which include drug
companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Hoechst Marion Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   After logging on to the DoubleTwist site, a visitor could enter
a partial sequence of a gene _ some combination of the letters A,
C, T and G, which make up the genetic alphabet _ and then search
for contiguous sequences that might lead to a full-length gene. Or
if the code of a full-length gene were known, the researcher could
ask in which tissues of the body that gene is found or found only
when in the presence of cancer. To the extent the answer is
available in the scientific literature, including patent filings,
the software would retrieve it and highlight relevant passages.
Other cross-referenced data might include notations on what
biochemical materials are required for working with a given gene in
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the capabilities of the computational biology that
underlies bioinformatics _ a field that Francis Collins, director
of the Human Genome Project for the National Institutes of Health,
says he now often counsels promising graduate students to look to
for career opportunities. ``I just think it is going to hit us like
a freight train and we really have too small a supply of expertise
in that area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a dichotomy between the opportunity and the
market reality for Pangea and competitors like Netgenics Inc. of
Cleveland; Informax Inc. of Rockville, Md.; Lion Bioscience AG of
Heidelberg, Germany; Compugen Ltd. of Tel Aviv; the Genomica Corp.
of Boulder, Colo.; and Molecular Applications Group of Palo Alto,
Calif. Most of these companies are five years old or more, yet few
are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, Pangea's president, said the two hurdles to expanding the
market have been complexity and cost. Besides the $500,000 price
for Pangea's suite of software programs, a suite customer must make
a comparable investment in hardware. And even though they have a
point-and-click graphical user interface, like any Windows
application, their sophistication has tended to restrict their use
to bioinformatics specialists within large pharmaceutical or
biotechnology companies, not to individual research scientists
without special training.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to the Web, Pangea will find neighbors with some
similar-sounding offerings. This week, HySeq Inc., a genomics
company in Sunnyvale, Calif., will launch GeneSolutions.com, which
will sell genes and genetic information over the Web. And there are
various Web sites, for example, that freely offer public-domain
algorithms, or mathematical formulas, that can perform the basic
tasks of bioinformatics. These include a technique called
clustering and alignment, which pieces together full-length genes
from the fragments spewed out by so-called automated sequencing
machines that derive their data from DNA samples.
</P>
<P>
   But these public-domain tools tend to be difficult to use, and
limited in their application to specific gene data bases. Pangea's
DoubleTwist, by contrast, will aggregate data from multiple
sources, and then make it available using software agents _ small
automated software programs that will scan the Web at a user's
request and return answers to complex biological queries via
e-mail. Theses agents can update information as it becomes
available, suggest necessary laboratory supplies and provide links
to vendors.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist is intended to complement rather than supplant
Pangea's established software suites. But Couch said it was
possible that a growing portion of the company's revenues would
come from the Web rather than packaged programs. Rather than buy
Pangea's software suite for $500,000, companies or academic
institutions could spend, say $10,000 a year to provide each user
access to these programs over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pangea's competition in this arena is companies very much like
itself: small, financed with venture capital and possessing more
programming prowess than marketing skills.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All of these companies are looking for ways to differentiate
themselves, and while an Internet presence is one way to do that,
it is by no means the only one.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Netgenics' programs run on corporate intranets,
rather than the World Wide Web. But they are built using Internet
technology like the Java programming language so that they can be
easily adapted to the specific needs of different customers.
``Pangea decided they would come up with the perfect schema for all
types of drug discovery and put a nice graphic user interface on
it,'' said Manuel J. Glynias, president and chief executive of
Netgenics, which was founded in 1996. ``We decided there was no
perfect schema because every pharmaceutical company is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Netgenics did consider a Web-based electronic commerce business
model, but decided a faster route to growth was to bundle
consulting services with custom bioinformatics software. So far,
customers include Abbott Laboratories and Pfizer. ``We've very much
targeted big pharma and biotech,'' Glynias said. ``They're the only
ones who can afford it, and really the only ones it makes sense
for. At the end of the day you've got 50 big pharma and biotech
companies and 100 medium-sized ones. It's not a big market.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market is small, creating a big company requires that
each sale be large, and Netgenics bases its goals on finding at
least 20 customers willing to pay $5 million annually for its
services.
</P>
<P>
   Another player, Lion Bioscience, takes that model a step
further. It recently announced a deal in which it would develop new
bioinformatics systems and identify target genes for drug
development by Bayer A.G. for an investment estimated at $100
million. The figure includes an up-front equity stake in Lion as
well as fees for use of Lion's existing information systems,
research and set-up costs for a new subsidiary to be based in
Cambridge, Mass., and royalties on drugs developed from the gene
targets identified at the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Lion calls its concept iBiology, and like Netgenics' approach,
it uses intranets rather than the Internet. ``It goes far beyond
the usual gene sequence analysis software,'' said Claus Kermoser,
Lion's vice president for corporate development. ``We crawl further
up the value chain to include the chemical side, and also
pharmacological and toxicology data. It's not just a software
package, tools and data; it's a solution for pharmaceuticals
research data management.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lion is actually a hybrid of pure-play bioinformatics
and genomics, because it sells gene targets along with
information-processing capabilities. Similarly, Compugen, after
building a successful business selling bioinformatics tools, has
recently added a genomics thrust, selling novel gene variants the
Compugen researchers have identified with the company's tools.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with these other companies, which have aimed for a
corporate clientele, Informax has taken a vastly different tack.
For six years it has sold a program for individual scientists,
Vector NTI, which is almost to biology what desktop publishing
software was to print publications. At $3,500 a user, for the
Windows or Macintosh versions, Vector NTI is not inexpensive. But
because it is a purchase that typically can be authorized at the
department level, it is the most widely used bioinformatics program
in the industry. It is used at 60 pharmaceuticals companies, 250
biotechnology concerns and 500 academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built our franchise by meeting the needs of the bench
biologist,'' said Timothy Sullivan, Informax's senior vice
president for marketing and sales. ``Informax took a bottom-up
approach and did it well, versus Pangea and Netgenics, who started
out at the enterprise level,'' he said. Informax recently
introduced its own enterprise product, Software Solution for
Bioscience, and hopes to use the leverage of its existing customer
base to win sales at large companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle for all of these competitors is that the large
companies that are their obvious customers often have substantial
bioinformatics capabilities of their own _ expertise that the
company may even view as a proprietary advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to do cutting-edge research, and if you're on
the leading edge of the curve that means you also have to develop
the software to do it,'' said Paul Godowski, director of molecular
biology at Genentech Inc., the pioneering biotech company. ``On the
other hand, there are products out there from these third-party
vendors we can import for our programs,'' Godowski. ``It's a
mixture, and I don't see that going away, certainly not at a place
like Genentech.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Pangea is looking to cyberspace to expand its
potential audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few select pharmas can afford the tools, and if they
can, then in some cases they can also afford to produce their own
software,'' Couch said. ``Why not take the infrastructure we've
created, add a graphic interface that makes it easier, and offer it
directly to the scientist? We are taking the Internet, which was
originally developed to do research, and giving it back to the
researchers.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every young Internet millionaire owes a debt to Tim Berners-Lee,
the creator of the World Wide Web. An Oxford-educated physicist, he
stitched together the core software of the multimedia branch of the
Internet while working in the shadow of the Swiss Alps at the CERN
physics laboratory outside Geneva nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps more important is what Berners-Lee did after he
designed the Web. He has served as a kind of parental guardian of
his creation, working tirelessly to insure that as much as possible
the Web remains a public mass-medium in cyberspace, an information
thoroughfare that is open to all, Rolls Royces and Rollerbladers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   That was his original vision for the Web _ a universal medium
for sharing information based on freely available technology
instead of being controlled by one or a few powerful companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, Berners-Lee has pursued that vision as
the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, whose mission is to
make sure that the fundamental software for identifying and sharing
information on the Web is a public standard. Keeping the Web open,
of course, has fueled its phenomenal growth, which in turn has
created a much larger market for commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   So it is one of the notable ironies of Net history: Because
Berners-Lee chose not to cash in on his invention, he has helped
expand the business opportunities for America Online, Amazon, Ebay,
Yahoo and every eager start-up sprinting to join the dot.com gold
rush.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book being shipped to bookstores this week, Berners-Lee
expresses some irritation at being asked _ especially by
incredulous Americans _ why he didn't go for the Internet gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is maddening is the terrible notion that a person's value
depends on how important and financially successful they are, and
that that is measured in terms of money,'' he states in ``Weaving
the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide
Web By Its Inventor'' (Harper San Francisco). The book was written
by Berners-Lee with Mark Fishetti, a freelance writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That suggests disrespect,'' Berners-Lee adds, ``for the
researchers across the globe developing ideas for the next leaps in
science and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berners-Lee has no hair-shirt aversion for business. He
writes that when leaving CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle
Physics, in early 1994 he considered ``starting a company with the
working name of Websoft, to do much the same as Netscape,'' whose
point-and-click browser software made the Web easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that entrepreneurial flirtation was a brief one, and by his
own account, it seems clear that Berners-Lee's instincts and
abilities lay elsewhere. He is the son of two English
mathematicians, Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee, who were computing
pioneers in their own right, having worked on a team that designed
one of the world's first commercial stored-program computers in the
early 1950s. Indeed, in his book, Berners-Lee describes the most
``tempting option'' in the corporate world was to join ``the
research group of a large benevolent company.''
</P>
<P>
   He did talk to several big companies about joining their
research labs, but he eventually decided to go to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science and found
the World Wide Web Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see the Web proliferate, not sink my life's hours
into worrying over a product release,'' Berners-Lee writes.
</P>
<P>
   At the consortium, he admits, he has restraints as well _ he
must strive to be a neutral diplomat in standards debates among
members like Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Oracle that are
often at odds in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the consortium, Berners-Lee decided, was the right place for
him. ``I'd be free,'' he writes of his decision, ``to really think
about what was right for the world, as opposed to what would be
best for one commercial interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weaving the Web'' is a book in two parts. The first is
essentially a narrative of creation, while the second is
Berners-Lee's view of the Web's future.
</P>
<P>
   His description of designing the Web underlines how much
innovation is a step-by-step process, using the work of others and
putting those building blocks together in new ways. In the case of
the Web, the key ingredients were hypertext for linking text in a
nonlinear format and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to come along with time, and the right interest and
inclination, after hypertext and the Internet had come of age,''
Berners-Lee writes. ``The task left to me was to marry them
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He came up with the software standards for addressing, linking
and transferring multimedia documents over the Internet. They have
the shorthand names that are second-nature to computer enthusiasts
and even familiar to, if little understood by, millions of Web
surfers: URL's (uniform resource locators), HTTP (hypertext
transfer protocol) and HTML (hypertext mark-up language).
</P>
<P>
   If Berners-Lee seems matter-of-fact about his work, much of the
computer science community was dismissive when they first saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a very simple approach,'' Jim Gray, a leading computer
scientist at Microsoft Research, recalled in an interview. ``It is
fair to say that everyone who saw it thought nothing of it. Very
simple, very minimal, anyone could have done it. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Gray continued, ``everyone was wrong and no one else
did it _ Tim did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee's breakthrough, apparently, is proof of the adage
that genius is a fresh approach to the obvious. ``I like that,''
Berners-Lee said last week in an interview. ``The Web is obvious,
after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Critical to the creative process, in his view, is placing a good
mind in an environment rich in the information that might be useful
in solving a problem _ a ``Web of information,'' he inevitably
calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creativity is a Web-like process, it's nonlinear but not
random either,'' he said. ``It requires ideas just floating _ that
is the state in which the mind can jiggle them into an insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee believes that the next stage of the Web, if properly
handled, holds the promise of greatly increasing the creative
productivity of groups, corporations and of society in general.
Whether that potential can be attained is an uncertainty that
hinges, he insists, on the evolution of the new technical standards
that the hundreds of members of the Web consortium are working to
develop and refine.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's first stage, based on HTML, can be thought of as
focused on addressing and presenting documents. The stage just
beginning to unfold, based on XML (extensible mark-up language) and
refinements like RDF (resource description framework), allows the
data inside documents to be identified with programming ``tags.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, a user has to know or find the address of a Web document
that contains information he or she wants. But increasingly, the
Web should become far more ``intelligent'' as small programs
sometimes called ``logic engines'' will be able to find the useful
data on areas of intellectual inquiry _ finding some facet of
Chaucer studies for Ph.D. research, for example, or corporate
projects like mapping the relationships and dependencies among
people, rivals and suppliers in an industry for competitive
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of Web technical standards essentially enables
computers to talk to each other, so that they do routine and
repetitive work involved in everything from homework to shopping.
And that leaves people with more time and energy for doing the more
creative tasks. The Web, in short, has the capacity to become a
much more intelligent information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're writing documents that contain logic,'' Berners-Lee
explained. ``It's a huge step forward toward a semantic Web, which
handles the meaning of data.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Berners-Lee calls the ``XML revolution,'' he writes, is
``both a boon and a threat to the Web dream.'' The danger, he says,
is a Balkanization of the Web _ if companies create their own XML
tags that cannot be read by everyone else. If that were to happen,
it would no longer be a universal medium of sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense against the threat, Berners-Lee says,
is his consortium, as the institutional guardian of the ``technical
integrity of the Web'' _ keeping the standards open.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, he says, he plans to stay at MIT for the next
several years. ``It is so important that we get this right that I
want to be there and throw my weight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His creation is still young. And Berners-Lee views it with a
mixture of parental pride and concern, and he is not yet willing to
let it go unsupervised. ``I think of the Web as an adolescent,'' he
said. ``It has started realizing it has a new-found power. No one
knows if it knows how to use it responsibly. And maturity is a long
way off.''

It's not difficult to check out a PC's Y2K readiness 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, I put the Y2K problem into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   I spent an entire week of vacation stripping wallpaper and
painting a bathroom, then _ in the process of moving a toilet so I
could paint behind it _ having water cascade through the floor into
the room below. After fixing all this, I decided that no matter how
bad Y2K problems get for the home PC user, they will never be as
severe as a leaky toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll end up being wrong as far as how bad things will be
for business and government computer networks; after all, not even
the experts can agree on that. But I'm pretty sure that when it
comes to the home user, there isn't much to worry about. What few
problems there are can be fixed easily.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with changing a setting in Windows that keeps your
computer from getting confused about the date when the year 2000
comes.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the Start button and select Settings. Then select Control
Panel and double-click to open the icon called Regional Settings.
Select the tab at the top that says Date. Change the setting for
Short Date Style (using the arrow at the right) so that it reads:
MM/dd/yyyy. That forces Windows to use four digits for the year (as
in 2001), compared with the two-digit style (which is the way
Windows normally handles year dates).
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to do is check to see how well your computer and
its software are prepared to handle other Year 2000 problems.
You'll hear a lot of dumb advice about how to do this, including
setting your computer's date ahead _ tricking it into thinking that
it is already the new century _ and then seeing what, if anything,
goes wrong. Don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, go to a Web site maintained by a company called NSTL
where you'll get some testing advice, including the statement that
``improper testing can be disastrous.'' At this site _ located at
www.nstl.com/html/nstly2k.htmlY(at)Kcheck _ you'll be able to
download software programs (at no cost) that will check your
computer without doing any harm. The NSTL is a good outfit and does
a lot of work for government and business testing software and
hardware, so you can trust it. Using the program is easy, by the
way: You simply download it, double-click to start it up and follow
the on-screen directions.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what the test reveals, you are almost done. But
there are still a few other things to do. One of the biggest Y2K
problems facing the home user is caused by older software programs
that weren't created with the year 2000 in mind.
</P>
<P>
   You can usually narrow the list of programs to worry about to
those where knowing the correct year is important. For instance,
you certainly will want to make sure that your money management
software, spreadsheets, databases and even word processor are
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find out is to go to the Web site of the
manufacturer of each program. If you don't know the address of the
Web site or can't find it in the manual, just use a Web search
engine such as AltaVista or Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Once you are at the Web site, you'll almost certainly find
information about which versions of the software have Y2K problems.
(You can usually find the version number of a program by checking
under the Help menu for that program and selecting the item called
``About.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, the Web site will tell you how to fix any Y2K
problems, or it may even have a free ``bug fix'' program that you
can download to automate the process of updating your program. For
really old programs, you may have to buy a new version.
</P>
<P>
   Now you've done the reasonable and practical things to prepare
your PC for the year 2000. Sure, there's more that you could do,
but these steps should be plenty for the average home user. Now you
can spend your time worrying about important stuff like leaky
toilets.

Site satirizes Mississippi's mobile homes 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every state has at least one whipping boy, a
neighboring state that serves as the butt of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Regions, too, have similar setups: West Virginia, for example,
is the home state for the subject of several jokes told in the
Mid-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps one state above all serves as the punch line for an
entire nation: Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, too, has its hierarchy. Mobile homes sit _ on
cinder blocks, no doubt _ near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Mobile Homes of Mississippi, www.kelleys.org/mhomes/,
is the Web site where the twain shall meet.
</P>
<P>
   As the introduction states, ``When you think of Mississippi,
what comes to mind? Illiteracy? Sweltering heat? Bigotry? Velvet
Elvis? These are all valid responses. However, we must remember
what Mississippi gives to the world of architecture. The mobile
home is an icon in every Mississippi town with as much symbolism as
the second-place trophy (the Civil War memorial) adorning every
Mississippi town square.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes, as one would imagine, irate letters from
offended readers. It also includes a gift shop and a group of
photos of trailers from one town, Columbus, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The photos show potentially mobile homes, trash-strewn yards and
rusting cars on cinder blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Author Doug Kelley provides a bit of commentary under each
photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to have a mobile-home owner's association
when selecting a neighborhood (a k a trailer park). Otherwise you
can have neighbors like this one who park their cars on the
driveway rather than on the yard. Also, note the dual air
conditioning units. Getting a little uppity, aren't we???''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a former Mississippi resident now living in Washington,
insists the site is not a digital ax grind against poor people. In
the question-and-answer section of the site, he addresses one
question that was asked, ``How can you make fun of poor people?''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor people!? ... I'm making fun of slobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A wide-ranging money site
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of money management sites on the Web, but the
folks at Microsoft have done such a good job of making co-founder
Bill Gates a multi-multibillionaire that moneycentral
</P>
<P>
   .msn.com is worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes columns on a range of issues, including family
finance, retirement and tuition planning, mutual funds, taxes and
investing.
</P>
<P>
   New features include links to financial advisers; news updates
from The Wall Street Journal, Reuters and MSNBC; the ability to pay
some bills online; 401(k) information; and college planning tools.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes Microsoft Passport, a service designed to
let people reach several Web accounts through one password. The
feature is expected _ keep in mind this is Microsoft we're talking
about _ to be available this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A four-letter word meaning `aid'
</P>
<P>
   The line of communication for crossword puzzle help runs
something like this: Ask your spouse/parent/roommate or look it up
in a dictionary. Now you can check the Web.
</P>
<P>
   One site, www.oneacross.com, is an online version of a crossword
puzzle dictionary. To find an answer, type the clue or phrase and
the number of space blocks. The site provides possible answers.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes links to almanacs, online crossword
puzzles and a crossword dictionary.

Sega Dreamcast in fast lane 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Joe Sampson, 17, deftly nudges a directional
control with his thumb, and the blond warrior goddess on the
television screen in front of him moves in on her barbarian
opponent with a high-pitched battle cry, swinging her magic sword
that separates into linked sections that snap like a whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the coolest weapon in the game,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   The goddess dances around the barbarian delivering kicks and
sword blows, her breath coming in clouds of white smoke as she
grunts and gasps in the cold mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Sampson has his minion leap in and grab the barbarian
for a judo flip that sends him flailing off the edge of the battle
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the people who rushed out and bought a Sega
Dreamcast when the next-generation game system went on sale Sept.
9, Sampson of Newberry Twp. imported a system from Japan and has
been playing since July. So he's had time to sharpen his skills at
several Dreamcast games.
</P>
<P>
   And this fan, who owns every game system Sega ever made, says
Dreamcast is clearly the best system available to home gamers _
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a lot smoother; the characters move more
realistically,'' Sampson said. ``The characters and the backgrounds
are more detailed and three-dimensional. And the games are fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers said many customers shared Sampson's enthusiasm the
first few days Dreamcast was available, and sales of the $199
systems were brisk. By the end of the first week after release many
stores were unable to keep the game system in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Donna DeGroat, who works in the electronics section at the Toys
R Us store near the Dayton Mall, said 64 customers ordered
Dreamcast in advance at her store, and another 20 bought games off
the shelf in the first two days it was available.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT DREAMCAST
</P>
<P>
   What it is...
</P>
<P>
   Sega Dreamcast plays games on discs that look like CDs, but the
discs hold more information than traditional CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The system has built-in expansion ports for future upgrades. It
starts with 24 megabytes of memory to handle complex interactive
games with rich, detailed backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The game system is based on a 200 MHz Hitachi SH-4 central
processing unit and the NEC PowerVR 2DC 3D graphics chip, which
Sega says is the most powerful 3D technology ever developed for a
console system.
</P>
<P>
   The Hitachi SH-4 gives the Sega Dreamcast 15 times the power of
a Sony PlayStation, 10 times the power of a Nintendo 64 and four
times the graphics processing power of the fastest Pentium II
processor, the company claims.
</P>
<P>
   The game has ports for four controllers to allow four players at
once. The system comes with one controller, and additional units
can be bought for $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamcast has a built-in 56k modem for online play, but the

Reviews mixed for upgrade of QuickTime multimedia player 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple recently released a major update of its popular
multimedia player QuickTime. The software, version 4.0, has
received mixed reviews from leading Mac sources such as magazines
MacWorld and MacAddict.
</P>
<P>
   Both applauded QuickTime's added functions but decried the look
of it. To quote the MacWorld reviewer, ``QuickTime Player is an
interface-design disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   QuickTime comes in two parts, one free and the other a $30
version that includes multimedia authoring features. The free
piece, called QuickTime Player, lets users play video and audio
clips.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's look at what reviewers like about QuickTime.
Everyone is raving about the ease with which you can download the
software from Apple's Web site. The minimal installation requires 2
megabytes. You can get additional features through an updating
utility that's part of the free software. But adding features
greatly increases QuickTime's size, which tops out at 7 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers also liked the addition of true streaming
capabilities. This is technology that lets you watch, say, a news
broadcast or hear a radio station in real time over the Internet.
Streaming is a feature that has been part of RealNetworks' and
Microsoft's Windows Media products for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there isn't much available to watch or listen to
yet with QuickTime 4.0. That should change over time, because
QuickTime is a prominent player in the multimedia market.
</P>
<P>
   QuickTime 4.0 also adds the ability to listen to MP3 files,
which have become the standard for storing and distributing popular
music across the Internet. But, unlike its competitors, QuickTime
doesn't include the ability to support playlists. Nor does it play
all types of MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   QuickTime 4.0 does, however, include some new, needed controls.
There's a panel of buttons, accessible through the press of an
icon, to control bass and treble like a CD player.
</P>
<P>
   What reviewers didn't like was the brushed aluminum look of
QuickTime and its set of controls. They said the bright finish
makes small movies appear too dark. They said the new favorites
drawer, where you can store bookmarks of favorite streaming sites,
was poorly designed.
</P>
<P>
   You can see what all the fuss is about for yourself. QuickTime
is easily downloaded from Apple's home page. The address is
www.apple.com/quicktime/.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Looking at this century on Web 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the late 1970s, the punk-rock group the Ramones had
a minor hit called ``End of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The song seemed a bit extreme then, about 20 years before
millennium madness would grip the world with a blend of panic and
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us came into the century and millennium late in the
game. We missed a lot of history, people and events. While waiting
for the dawn of the new century, why not take a look at the last
hundred or thousand years courtesy of that time machine on your
desk _ a computer connected to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't got the time or the attention span to review
every significant historical blip over the last thousand years,
Britain's Guardian newspaper is a quick way to brush up in a hurry
without breaking a sweat. The Guardian is slicing its way through
the millennium in short order with a site called ``1,000 Years in
500 Days'' (www.newsunlimited.co.uk).
</P>
<P>
   The countdown has begun, so if you bookmark the site now, you'll
have missed 400 days or so, but it's still worth a visit. The focus
is on British history, with a nod to Europe and those upstart
Americans. But there are also links to popular fashions,
philosophers and politicians through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Another quick fix is provided by Time magazine, which has
compiled the Time 100. The project (www.pathfinder.com
</P>
<P>
   /time/time100/index.html) started in March 1998 and is divided
into easy-to-swallow sections such as Leaders and Revolutionaries,
Artists and Entertainers, Builders and Titans, Scientists and
Thinkers, and Heroes and Icons.
</P>
<P>
   Time will cap off the list by naming its Person of the Century
in December. It also invites readers to vote for the bests and
worsts _ something the print edition never does.
</P>
<P>
   Especially fun is the section that asks you to vote for the
worst ideas of the century. Oh my! So many choices! Everything from
``The Jerry Springer Show'' to the Titanic, New Coke and baseball's
designated hitter rule. This site is great fun, and you may learn a
little something, too. Vote early and often. It's your century,
too, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on the Web has always been known for
outstanding specials, and its six special editions focusing on the
millennium are both beautiful to look at and amazingly
comprehensive, with audio, video and interactive polls and chats.
</P>
<P>
   The first special, called simply ``The Best,'' includes articles
from literary luminaries such as Joyce Carol Oates, Wendy
Wasserstein, Scott Turow and Umberto Eco.
</P>
<P>
   The second installment focuses on contributions made by women in
the last thousand years. It's called ``Women: The Shadow Story of
the Millennium'' (www
</P>
<P>
   .nytimes.com/library
</P>
<P>
   /magazine/millennium/m2
</P>
<P>
   /index.html). There are articles on everything from the struggle
of China's women to Deborah Tannen on communication between the
sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The third installment focuses on centuries of exploration and
man's need to venture into the unknown. It's beautifully designed,
and the topics are well thought out and offbeat enough to hold the
attention of readers with almost no interest in world history but
who love any kind of well-told story. The Times plans several more
millennium specials, which should be worth waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   One good reason to download and install the RealAudio player is
to listen to, rather than read, some of this century's great
speeches _ from Winston Churchill to the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. to the infamous ``Wear Sunscreen'' essay written by a Chicago
Tribune writer that was splashed over the Internet as Kurt
Vonnegut's MIT commencement address several years ago (he wasn't
there and never gave it).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the speeches, brought to the Web by Elycia's Real Audio
and the Minnesota Law Network (www.chicago-law.net
</P>
<P>
   /speeches/speech.html) take advantage of the Web to bring a
little bit of history to life.
</P>
<P>
   As the phone company used to say, it's the next best thing to
being there.

 &HT;    LAWYERS NOT PROVIDED FOR YOUNG ASYLUM-SEEKERS
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Sept. 26
 &HT;    By SUSAN E. SMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of children who illegally enter the United
States by themselves each year are deported without the benefit of
legal counsel, immigration officials and human rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
   American children in the judicial system have court-appointed
attorneys, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service is not
required to provide free legal representation to these
unaccompanied children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children, who come from nations as different as
Honduras and China, are returned to countries that are plagued by
violence and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As more children become the victims of violence and regional
wars, human rights groups and lawyers are seeking to change the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other area of law where children are expected to
answer charges, appear before a judge and prosecutors and represent
themselves without the benefit of an appointed counsel,'' said
Steve Lang, coordinator and attorney for the South Texas Pro Bono
Asylum Representation Project, or ProBAR.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 11 percent of adult detainees receive legal
representation during asylum proceedings, said Wendy Young, author
of a widely cited study on children and U.S. asylum practices. She
estimates that the figure is significantly less for unaccompanied
children.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials could not say how many of the unaccompanied
children receive legal representation or are eventually granted
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law does not require that illegal immigrants receive free
legal representation. However, children are given a list of pro
bono attorneys when they are apprehended by the agency, said John
Pogash, national juvenile coordinator for the INS.
</P>
<P>
   To be granted asylum, a person must demonstrate political
persecution, which sounds simple but is as confounding as
navigating the tax code, immigration lawyers say. Federal law,
which mirrors the United Nations Convention on Refugees, states
that a person must prove persecution based on race, religion,
national origin, political belief or association with a group.
</P>
<P>
   With children, that's particularly difficult to prove because
they are too young to comprehend their circumstances, let alone
explain them to others, said Young, a staff attorney and Washington
liaison for the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, whose office is in Harlingen, Texas, divides the children
who enter the country alone into three categories: those who want
to return home right away, those who have families in the United
States, and those who could seek asylum on their own. Pro bono
attorneys target the latter group.
</P>
<P>
   The push for legal counsel for young asylum seekers comes at a
time when Congress is preparing to debate new immigration bills. A
bill has yet to be introduced that requires legal counsel for
children who enter the United States illegally, but congressional
staffers say the issue is being discussed by some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say U.S. tax dollars should not be used to help these
young illegal immigrants and that too little information exists
about the problem to start discussing solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ask taxpayers to be funding a blank check is a pretty
radical departure (from current immigration policy) and potentially
very expensive for something that may be helping organized criminal
activities,'' said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation
for American Immigration Reform. Some of the children could be used
by adults as drug couriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,300 children illegally entered the United States
last year, according to INS records. More than 1,300 of the
children were detained for an average of 32 days in shelters and
juvenile detention centers, a practice Young and others criticize.
A majority of those in custody, usually teenaged boys, entered the
country alone.
</P>
<P>
   Children in INS custody are placed either in shelters, foster
homes or juvenile correctional facilities, many of which are in
states along the Mexican border, until their cases are settled.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children helped the
INS develop new guidelines for the treatment of children seeking
asylum. The issue is increasingly important to immigration reform
groups at a time when children are the majority of the world's
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 United Nations study found that in the prior decade war
and upheavals had killed 2 million children, disabled 4 million to
5 million and rendered homeless 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many children like Oscar, a 15-year-old Honduran, come to the
United States to flee street life. Oscar, an orphan, was routinely
beat up by gangs and police officers, according to lawyers who
represented him in asylum hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose full name was withheld to protect his identity,
repeatedly fled foster homes and shelters before the INS sent him
to juvenile detention centers in Liberty County, Texas, and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He recently received asylum and soon could be adopted by a Texas
family, ending his 18-month odyssey in the U.S. immigration system.
</P>
<P>
   His happy ending is the exception to the rule, say advocates.
Few children who enter this country alone are granted asylum, and
few are adopted, they say. Here, too, the numbers are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16,975 people who were granted asylum this year, 2,735
were children, according to the INS. The agency couldn't say how
many of the children who received the asylum entered the United
States alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal representation (for asylum seekers) is a big growth
industry because of the people on the move,'' said Stein. ``It's
straining the (American Bar Association's) resources and
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a move on the part of activists to expand the
(asylum) process, but we can't provide refugee status for everyone
who is fleeing random political violence,'' argued Stein, who said
he understands concerns about the children's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   When a child is denied asylum, the INS contacts his or her
embassy or consulate, which arranges to repatriate the child.
</P>
<P>
   Although most agree the larger issue is securing legal counsel
for the children, human rights groups also want the INS to stop
holding youth in juvenile detention centers. In many cases,
innocent children share facilities with American children who have
committed violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this kid has suffered in any way, then you are taking the
very victim of persecution and punishing them further by detaining
them with criminals,'' said Lang of ProBAR.
</P>
<P>
   The only children routinely placed in such facilities are those
who might flee or who exhibit behavioral problems, INS officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the children are placed in the juvenile facilities
when there is nowhere else for them to go, Pogash explained.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue, say advocates for immigration reform, is the
need for asylum policies to incorporate new forms of persecution
aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that inflict human rights abuse have realized that
inflicting abuses on children is an effective way to get at the
whole family,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making sure that legal counsel is in place is one way to
ensure our jurisprudence (in cases involving children) evolves
appropriately,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein said more information should be gathered on the
children before pushing for a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operations of the INS are deplorable, and we all know
it,'' he said. ``But it's not prudent to make policy based on the
scanty information we have.''

   ``Breakfast in New Orleans,

</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cockburn. Rykodisc. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Like a wandering poet, Canadian singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn
collects pictures, couching his sense of existential mystery in the
concrete. A ceiling fan becomes a mandala, hope a flame, and a
mango much more than mere fruit. Since the power of love colors
every guitar-ringing number, whether Middle Eastern acoustic or
Delta-fied electric, it makes sense to underpin these soul-stirring
songs with a woman's voice. Lucinda Williams' bluesy harmonies
enrich nearly half, her warm whispers a grounding for his coolest
abstractions. Though vocalists Margo Timmins and Jonell Mosser do
backup too, Cockburn's pairings with Williams, especially the
lovely rooftop still-life ``Look How Far the Light Came,'' are
best. His arpeggiated guitar sounds like the sun's waning rays,
streaming through a jewel-like glass of wine; gold and pink merging
the way their soaring voices do: pop music in the service of art.

</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about race relations in the '90s when a group of
young Southern black men can call themselves Jim Crow. In short,
it's a signal that the Atlanta rap trio embraces its home in its
shiny and shameful entirety. For further explanation spend some
time in the ``Crow's Nest,'' a debut outstanding in its near
sample-free production and well-rounded in its storytelling. Be
warned, the cringe factor is as prominent as its melodic tales of
``frapping'' (sex) and ``baby mama drama'' are frequent. But so is
the sincerity when it takes all of that into consideration: ``I try
to tighten up,'' goes ``One of These Days, ``but dollar signs keep
lighting up in front of my face / And I can taste it / So I'm on
this paper chase / Wastin' my precious time / Trying to pace my
grind / Unaware of the finish line/ (Expletive) dying.''

   Carla Cook. MaxJazz. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   If the listener is broad-minded enough, vocalist Carla Cook's
MaxJazz debut yields many riches. Finicky straight-ahead jazz
purists or folks expecting strictly a Dianne Reeves-inspired
jazz-infused brew of steaming R&AMP;B will likely be dismayed. As Cook
herself explains in the liner notes, ``I listen to the masters, and
that can mean Miles (Davis) or Chaka Khan.'' What makes ``It's All
About Love'' such a pleasant surprise is that like Davis and Khan,
Cook's exquisitely supple instrument can tackle either genre with
complete ease. At points, Cook's elasticity is reminiscent of Al
Jarreau. Accompanied only by bassist Darryl Hall on the first verse
of ``The Way You Look Tonight,'' Cook comes off as a shy
seductress. By the time the rest of the trio joins in, she's kicked
off her high heels vocally, dimmed the lights and cracked open the
champagne. The outing features fine support by pianist Cyrus
Chestnut, Hall and drummer Billy Kilson. As evidenced by the
life-affirming lyrics and groove of the title track, Cook can
write, too.

 &HT;    Slow food: Take time to smell the pot roast
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twentieth century scientific and technological advancements have
made lots of things more accessible, faster and convenient for more
people, but there is a high price to pay. As we have come to expect
instant gratification and instant responses, any sort of delay sets
us on edge. We have become desensitized and impatient with the time
taken to accomplish some of the simple processes of life.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting this trend in a quiet, civilized way is a group called
Slow Food, an international movement that believes the first
defense against the dehumanizing frenzy of modern life begins by
rediscovering the convivial joy of the table.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1989 in Italy as a response to a fast food franchise
opening on an ancient piazza in Rome, the movement now has about
60,000 members in 35 countries. Local branches called Convivia
exist in 21 cities across the United States; the groups meet
regularly to prepare and immerse themselves in long, leisurely
meals.
</P>
<P>
   The microwave is anathema to the Slow Food philosophy, which
actively opposes the ``nuke it and eat it'' way of life. They
believe that the patient preparation of a meal _ the careful
chopping, the slow stirring, the mixing, the blending of
ingredients _ is a form of meditation that fosters concentration
and patience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to Slow Food than just preparing and enjoying
wonderful food. The group is concerned that the fast food culture
and multinational food conglomerates are eroding the world's
culinary and cultural heritage. Indeed, we have in our midst an
entire generation of young people whose palates respond only to Big
Macs and fries. Further, more and more indigenous foods have
disappeared and been replaced with often tasteless, scientifically
engineered varieties in the name of convenience and low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food is out to buck this trend by sponsoring a variety of
events designed to educate and enlighten people as to what is at
stake and inspire people to reclaim their culinary heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The organization vigorously supports farmers and food artisans
who grow and use heirloom foods despite the economic hardships
involved. They organize food tastings, cooking classes, trips, and,
yes, some memorable eating experiences. A recent event sponsored by
a New York convivia re-created the family dinner from Thomas Mann's
novel ``Buddenbrooks.''
</P>
<P>
   RELATED SITES
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in finding out more about the effects of
fast food on our culture, the Internet has many insightful and
interesting sites.

   ATLANTA _ Shirley Barker of Morrow (Ga.) lost her recipe for a
favorite Hawaiian Banana Bread that was moist and is greatly
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Her request resulted in a handful of possibilities, including
the two tested here. The first is baked in a flat pan and includes
coconut, which Barker does not remember from her earlier recipe.
The second is baked in loaf pans and is denser and moister,
according to our tester, who liked both but preferred the loaf
version.

 &HT;    Searching for the best of the Octoberfest brews
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no telling how many hogs and chickens have
donated their ribs and rumps, knuckles and drumsticks to the cause,
but Munich is merry with the spirit of Octoberfest, the 16-day,
end-of-summer festival that Americans must think is written into
the city charter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of Bavaria is bursting with bonhomie. Fests of one
kind or another are in full swing, with some 5 million tourists and
locals filling beer halls and biergartens to eat, drink and be very
merry indeed. It's a historical footnote that Octoberfest was
conceived not as the world's largest beer party, but as a wedding
reception. In 1810, when Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria was married
to Queen Theresia, the groom's father invited the townsfolk to the
village green afterward for a big picnic, with food and beer on the
crown.
</P>
<P>
   The village green is now a fairgrounds, and on the first Sunday
of Octoberfest a parade makes its way there. The big brewers of
Munich _ classic names such as Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr,
Lowenbrau, Hofbrauhaus _ all take part, and over the next two weeks
their huge beer halls are packed.
</P>
<P>
   The beers of Octoberfest, deep bronze to amber in color and malt
accented, are twins to the Marzen beers brewed in March but enjoyed
in autumn. Munich restricts its party to the local breweries, but a
visitor can enjoy himself just as well by escaping to one of the
smaller towns nearby. One is Aying, where he could sup on dumplings
and sausages while sipping Octoberfest as brewed by one of the
world's great breweries, Ayinger.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that you pretty much have to be there _ in Munich
or the countryside _ to know the real taste of Octoberfest beer.
Even so, Octoberfests were showing up on shelves in Atlanta as
early as August, a domestic version from Samuel Adams leading the
way. The reasons have more to do with commerce than tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But these are beers _ lightly hopped, and complex in their malt
profile _ that don't travel well. We sampled six, five from Germany
plus the Sam Adams. Four of the five German Octoberfests were
oxidized to one degree or another. One of the imports, from Beck's,
was surprisingly fresh and produced an impressively creamy crown.
It just didn't have the malty character you expect of an
Octoberfest. But then, Beck's is brewed in the northwest German
city of Bremen and not in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   Impressions of the other five:
</P>
<P>
   Paulaner. Good, toasty malty flavor that hinted at what it must
taste like in Munich. Oxidized, but not so much that a glass
couldn't be enjoyed over German potato salad, bratwursts,
stone-ground mustard and pumpernickel. An entire six-pack (about
$7.98) would be an investment in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker-Pschorr ($6.98). Malt character slightly deeper than that
of the Paulaner, but also a step further along in oxidation.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's ($5.98). A little more body than either the Paulaner or
the Hacker-Pschorr, and clearly fresher. Beer to beer, Beck's is
not in a league with any of the Munich breweries, but its
Octoberfest this year is better than last year's. Whether it's in
the Marzen/Octoberfest style is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Spaten Ur-Marzen ($6.98). A classic beer from the 14th-century
brewery whose name is associated with the development of lagering
methods and with the Marzen/Octoberfest style. A creamy white head,
with a firm body and rounded maltiness. But, sad to say, the
freshness was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Ayinger ($2.68 for 17-ounce bottle). Thick, rocky head over what
looks to be an unfiltered beer. A deeper malt profile and longer
finish than the Spaten. Drunk fresh, this might have been the best
of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Adams ($6.48). Not having spent time in the hold of a
ship, the Sam Adams was fresh and clean, and in many respects it
held its own. But the head receded quickly, and the malt character
seemed a bit thin.
</P>
<P>
   All of these beers are made to be enjoyed with the sweetness of
grilled meats, especially pork and chicken, the richness of
dumplings and German cheeses. Slightly spicy and mellow in the
mouth, they marry well with dishes that are in no way subtle but
are sumptuous as anything can be.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   In the countries of Northern Europe, a boy with white or very
blond hair is sometimes called a flaxhead. It is not a put-down. To
the contrary, a flaxhead is often a leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But you see the word ``flax-head'' on the label of Vlaskop and
think something else _ at least I did. What do you know, I thought,
here's a beer with flax in the grist. Other brewers have added hemp
seeds, still others rye. A portion of oats gives some of the best
stouts their silky smoothness, and corn is a staple of many a
cheaply made lager, including Corona. The best-selling beer in the
world _ Budweiser _ uses rice.
</P>
<P>
   So why not flax?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere someone's probably using a pinch, but Brewery Strubbe
of Belgium uses only barley, along with hops, yeast and water. By
``flaxhead,'' the Flanders brewers are referring to the beer's
color, a cloudy white-yellow that in certain light can even suggest
apple-green.
</P>
<P>
   Vlaskop is an unfiltered wheat-style ale without wheat, light in
body with almost a citrusy quality. It's hard to achieve such
lightness of body in a beer using only barley in the grist, but
Vlaskop would fool even an experienced beer judge. This is a summer
beer that doesn't call itself one, delightful year-round as an
aperitif, with salads or with white-meat fish.
</P>
<P>
   At $2.89 a bottle Vlaskop isn't cheap, but you don't judge
Belgian beers by six-pack prices any more than you judge them with
a six-pack palate.
</P>

 &HT;    In today's multi-genre music world, ex-Soundgarden singer Chris
Cornell proudly plays ...
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``rock'' rarely stands alone anymore. In recent years,
the most revolutionary musical form of the 20th century has
shattered into a million subgenres, giving rise to such niche terms
as ``extreme rock'' (Korn, Limp Bizkit), ``jam-rock'' (Widespread
Panic, Dave Matthews), even ``post-rock'' (Tortoise, Gastr del
Sol).
</P>
<P>
   The first solo album by the ex-lead belter for deified grunge
group Soundgarden extols the virtues of that once-sufficient
monosyllabic label. ``Euphoria Morning'' defiantly treads rock's
vast, neglected middle ground between screechy noise merchants and
Top 40 pop jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   No hyphens need be used to describe its majestic guitar sound
and slowly building tempos or Cornell's magnificently arena-size
voice. Even the song titles speak to a simpler, more unified time _
would Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst ever sing a tune as dreamily
'70s-reverent as ``Moonchild''?
</P>
<P>
   The anthemic opener, ``Can't Change Me,'' builds on the
Beatles-inflected sonic boom of Soundgarden's own ``Black Hole
Sun.'' With more vocal economy than he ever exhibited with his
former band, Cornell sings about a man who refuses to give up his
old ways, no matter how limiting they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen too many rock icons turn to techno, disco or
Top 40 R&AMP;B to salvage their careers will find Cornell's
stubbornness comforting. For keepers of rock's perilously
flickering flame, ``Euphoria Morning'' sounds like a new day
dawning.

 &HT;    McBride shows limited `Emotion'
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you get the feeling that country music is having an identity
crisis (i.e., crusty geezers Alabama singing with 'N Sync), this CD
from tiny powerhouse Martina McBride plops the genre down squarely
on the therapist's couch. Although her voice is one of the
strongest laying down tracks in any studio, McBride seems to have
set her sights on becoming Nashville's sunshine and lollipops gal
rather than a barroom queen. Although the Kansas songbird has shown
she can sing V-8 country (``Whatever You Say''), she's opted to hop
on Faith Hill's Top 40 joy ride with a set of tunes that are as
edgy as a VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   The breezy single ``I Love You'' is typical of the offerings
here, a slumber-party-perfect tune designed for little-girl
lip-sync (``Baybee, you're so cooool!''). One exception is the
Indigo Girlish ``Love's the Only House,'' a kind of out-of-place
'90s protest song about ghettos and guns laid over a Dylan
harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   While peers such as Jo Dee Messina and Lee Ann Womack prove that
there's still plenty of potential in earthy, dime-store country,
McBride is tossing out songs like samples at a Neiman Marcus
cosmetics counter. Maybe next time, she'll get back to basics.

<P>
   &QR;  ``The Out-of-Towners'' (PG-13) _ It's a mess from the start.
The screenplay is based on the Neil Simon original 1970 film, but
it feels staler the second it starts to unreel. Henry (Steve
Martin) and Nancy Clark (Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple
from Ohio trying to redefine their lives now that the children are
grown. They land in New York and high jinks ensue. The only time
the film hints at the madcap success it could be is when John
Cleese appears as the secretly cross-dressing hotel manager. Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   _Drew Jubera
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ravenous'' (R) _ Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce star in a
19th-century black comedy about cannibalism. Yep, you heard that
right. A strange mix of frontier humor and vampire tale, the movie
is energetically made and gleefully gross, but it outstays its
welcome. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Open Your Eyes'' (R) _ A jigsaw puzzle of a film blending
elements of paranoid thriller and romantic melodrama. Director and
co-writer Alejandro Amenabar wants to deliver a Hitchcockian
mystery in '90s clothes (there's even an explicit homage to a
famous scene in ``Vertigo''). For its first half, it's an
intriguing ride. But the movie starts to feel like a short story
that's been uncomfortably stretched to feature-length. In Spanish
with subtitles. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Joan of Arc'' (unrated) _ Leelee Sobieski glows. Even when
she's not being burned at the stake as Joan of Arc, even in the
midst of a battle scene bogged down in mud, the 16-year-old actress
(who strongly resembles a young Helen Hunt) is so radiant, so
utterly convinced and convincing, that you'll want to follow her
into battle
</P>
<P>
   just like legions of mud-spattered Frenchmen do repeatedly in
this made-for-TV miniseries. Priced to buy, $19.98. Grade: B

 &HT;    `Matrix' is technological thrill ride
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski's surprise blockbuster turns out to be the year's best
blend of story, action and FX, easily beating out the noisy
kiddiefest called ``The Phantom Menace.'' The filmmaking brothers,
who first teamed for ``Bound,'' bring their sharp storytelling and
visual showmanship to an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that
should please both comic book fanatics and mainstream moviegoers _
at least those with attention spans resilient enough to follow the
twisty plot. Reeves plays a computer hacker nicknamed Neo who falls
in with a band of rebels in black leather (Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss among them) who open his eyes to Balancing
intelligence. With stunning special effects and action, it's a
movie that earns its explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent
bullets. The VHS is priced for rental; DVD, $24.98. Grade: A-

WHAT DID BILL BRADLEY THINK HE WAS ACCOMPLISHING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom regarding the viability of Bill
Bradley's campaign for president seems to be changing by the day _
or maybe by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   When he first decided to challenge Vice President Al Gore for
the Democratic presidential nomination, Bradley's long-shot
campaign was widely derided as an exercise in futility. But as
Bradley quietly went about the business of raising money and
drumming up grassroots support, the perception that he was a
no-chance underdog began to change.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the deep-thinkers were advising us to take Bradley
seriously, to consider the possibility that the former basketball
star might be tiptoeing toward a gigantic upset in this race that
so recently had been dismissed as no race at all.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Bradley's success, some analysts said, was that
he was cleverly positioning himself slightly to the left of Gore in
hopes of appealing to liberal Democrats who are disenchanted with
what they see as the Clinton-Gore administration's pandering to the
center of the political spectrum. The trick for Bradley was to
energize liberals during the primary campaign without coming off as
a radical left-winger who would be unelectable in November.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seemed to be working perfectly until Bradley unveiled
two proposals: amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban
discrimination against homosexuals, and changing military
regulations to allow gays to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   His plan to rewrite the Civil Rights Act moved Bradley so far
off the beaten path that he found himself out of step even with
ultra-liberals and gay-rights defenders such as Barney Frank, the
openly gay Massachusetts congressman. And Bradley's proposal on
overhauling the military's policy on homosexuals provoked
considerable criticism _ especially when he admitted that he hadn't
consulted with military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe quoted Frank as saying that Bradley's plan to
add gay rights to the Civil Rights Act was ``well-intentioned but
very incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his instinct. ... But he is mistaken about the way to
do it. What Bill Bradley has proposed ignores the very careful
legislative work we've been doing. I wish he had checked with us,''
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bradley's idea of doing away with ``don't ask, don't
tell'' and opening the military to gays, well, just ask Bill
Clinton what happens to politicians who make such promises without
checking with the generals. It was Clinton, in fact, who conjured
up ``don't ask, don't tell'' after his attempt to lift the
military's ban against gays was shot down by the brass.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises a question: What was Bradley trying to
accomplish with this pair of controversial and unachievable
proposals?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had already set himself up as a leaning-to-the-left
alternative to Gore. There was no reason to risk branding himself
as a wild-eyed liberal bent on creating havoc with radical policies
that most voters would find unappealing if not thoroughly
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bradley figured that he needed to shake things up, to
generate some interest in a race that so far has failed to capture
the public's attention. But it seems a little early for that sort
of desperation; the first primaries are still months away.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Bradley's money machine has started to sputter and he
hoped to jingle the cash register with some contributions from
gay-rights activists. Wouldn't you think he'd have been better off
making some phone calls and sending out a few letters?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there is some good news here _ for voters, if not
for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he radicalizes himself right out of the race, Bradley
still has a fighting chance to become the Democratic nominee. And
the more forthright he is about his liberalism, the easier it will
be for the voting public to distinguish his views from those of the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The third-party crowd keeps complaining that Democrats and
Republicans are too much alike. If Bradley is the Democratic
candidate in 2000, that could change in a hurry.

COMPANIES OFTEN MISS THE TALENT WITHIN, AUTHOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Hewlett-Packard recently appointed Carleton
``Carly'' Fiorina as president and chief executive officer, the
move symbolized two major trends in corporate America. Lost behind
the obvious one _ more women are gradually rising to the top _ is
another trend expected to have a huge impact over the next decade:
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard, the Palo Alto-based computer company
widely regarded as one of the best places to work in the world, has
tens of thousands of employees, its directors weren't comfortable
promoting one of their current workers to chief executive. They
chose Fiorina, who had been president of Lucent Technologies'
global service provider business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is hardly alone. Only a few companies, such as
General Electric and Pepsi, have a reputation for training
employees well enough to take over, says author William C. Byham,
the chief executive of Development Dimensions International in
Bridgeville, Pa. ``There aren't many in the Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 50 corporations by his company found that
barely a third have high confidence that they will be able to find
qualified leaders in the next five years, says Byham, author of
such books as ``Zapp! The Lightning of Empowerment'' and ``Grow
Your Own Leaders,'' due to be published in January.
</P>
<P>
   And he expects the problem to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have shrunk their middle management, which has been
the growing ground'' for future leaders, Byham says. ``The
retirement age is going down, while the requirements of the job are
going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although organizations certainly have good reasons to bring in
people from outside, doing so leads to four potential problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ Resentment from longtime employees who didn't get promoted.
That can make them less loyal to the company, making the new boss's
job even harder.
</P>
<P>
   _ The high costs of recruiting and replacement. In a survey,
Byham's company found that the average first-year cost for
replacing an executive is $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Byham says studies have shown that outsiders brought in fail
in their jobs about half the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new person probably will have less long-term loyalty to
the company than someone who spent years there and rose through the
ranks. Byham's company did a study showing that although many
leaders pursue development for practical and personal growth, 70
percent said they do it to make themselves more marketable for
other jobs _ not necessarily to help their current organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the cutback in middle management is the aging work
force. Byham says that in the San Francisco area, for example,
about half the senior managers at large companies are expected to
retire within five years. That means the few who do have management
skills will be in high demand, he says, while those companies that
have not developed executives will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no statistical reason why the demand is not going to
go up,'' Byham says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that some companies kid themselves by having a list of
successors on the chain of command, knowing deep down that those
people don't have the skills or training to take over if the key
person leaves. Or they may have an eye on rising talents _ only to
see them move on to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have great hopes for this person,'' Byham says, ``but
nobody ever told them.''
</P>
<P>
   For a company to develop its own leaders, Byham says the upper
management first must be strongly committed to it. That in itself
can be a problem, as some insecure managers don't want to train
people to take their place, fearing that they might be forced into
retirement earlier than they had planned.
</P>
<P>
   He says the idea of identifying a successor for a specific job
is out of date because workplaces and global business conditions
change so frequently, so companies are better off doing what top
football teams do when drafting players from college: Look for the
``best athlete available.''
</P>
<P>
   By teaching potential leaders many general skills, Byham says,
companies will be able to find the right people for the right spots
as they evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Although all workers should have good opportunities, Byham says
it is important to identify several people for the ``fast track,''
giving them the kinds of assignments that will develop their
management skills. The companies need to look at the people's
talents, their willingness to work the kinds of long hours
management often demands, and any other factors the company might
want, such as ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to get ethnic diversity by just looking at
the people who are ready now. You have to look farther down the
organization.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For companies that want to develop those leaders, Byham offers
several tips, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask top executives what experiences potential leaders should
have to develop the skills necessary for rising to the top.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put people through assessment centers, simulations that offer
a day in the life of a mythical manager, to see what skills they
need to work on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure ``fast track'' people know they have a place in the
organization's future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have executive coaches for high-potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pairing senior executives with younger partners can
have dual benefits: It develops skills for the younger partner
while enticing the executive to postpone retirement for a year or
two.

LOOK FOR INSPIRATION IN WORK AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the last couple of months, there is one
phrase that I find myself saying over and over again _ and it's not
``Don't we have any chocolate around here?'' Whether I'm sitting in
traffic or getting back from lunch or watching television, I'll
mutter to myself, ``God, I hate work.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: As jobs go, mine's a good one, with generous
amounts of freedom and flexibility, decent pay and nice people to
work with. But that doesn't mean I can't develop an irrational
hatred of it every once in a while, even for a couple of months at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   Some career counselors would be aghast at all this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Do what you love, they'd say. Follow your passion. Repeat
affirmations like ``My job is wonderful,'' ``I'm good at what I
do'' and ``Work gives my life purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of your career as running a marathon. It's challenging, it
demands a lot of energy and it can give you a terrific sense of
exhilaration and purpose, but it also seems to take forever, and
can leave you gasping for breath long before your 26 miles are up.
If you're not careful, it can even kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors are rarely marathon runners. They usually
start in one career, then decide after several years to become
counselors. Instead of running a 26-mile race, they choose two
13-mile races. That can be a terrific strategy, but it's not the
same thing as running a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you're gasping for air at the 13-mile mark. You don't
hate your boss, your co-workers or your company, but that finish
line called retirement sure seems a long way away. Unless you see
another career out there that stirs your passion, how do you decide
whether to change to something else or keep running the marathon?
Look for a water station.
</P>
<P>
   Every few miles, most marathon runners grab a cup of water,
either for dousing or for drinking. It gives them strength to
continue the journey.
</P>
<P>
   When you're young and talented and in a decent company, your
career has plenty of water stations. A lot of things seem fresh and
interesting, your bosses offer encouragement and your pay raises
seem huge.
</P>
<P>
   But then the water stations start growing scarce. A lot of
things seem stale and boring, your bosses take you for granted and
your pay raises barely keep up with the cost of living _ if you're
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting at this point to start jogging, moseying your way
toward the finish line. That's how people get laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Look instead for water stations from the rest of your life,
things that inspire you and give you energy. They can help you
decide whether you're just temporarily out of breath or are so
wiped out that you should stop and run a different race.
</P>
<P>
   You can draw energy from hobbies or spirituality or people you
see every day, like teachers and friends and family. Traveling
always inspires me, which is why I'm not too concerned about hating
work for the moment. When I know that a nice vacation is around the
corner, it keeps me from going around the bend.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the day-to-day stuff doesn't cut it, though, here are sources
of workplace inspiration:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Patch Adams.'' In the movie, based on a true story, Robin
Williams' character commits himself to a mental institution because
he's feeling suicidal. While he's there, he finds his purpose:
helping other patients.
</P>
<P>
   Adams goes on to become a doctor, making laughter a regular part
of his work. He doesn't buy the notion that doctors should maintain
a sense of detachment, or that medical insurance should set the
standard for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He gets frustrated with the day-to-day garbage we all have to
put up with, but he never loses sight of the people he's helping _
and how the quality of his work can change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. Seeded seventh in an
eight-team field, back in the time of the Cold War and the Iranian
hostages, the team upset the powerful Soviet Union and went on to
win the gold medal. It may have been called the Miracle on Ice, but
it was the product of hard work and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``For seven months they pushed each other on and pulled each
other along, from rung to rung, until for two weeks in February
they _ a bunch of unheralded amateurs _ became the best hockey team
in the world,'' E.M. Swift wrote when Sports Illustrated named the
team as Sportsmen of the Year. ``The best TEAM. The whole was
greater than the sum of its parts by a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes teamwork shows you just how great you can be. For
those who don't have a long memory or a Y chromosome, the same sort
of thing happened on a smaller scale this year with the U.S.
Women's World Cup soccer team. They were an inspiration to us all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Nelson Bolles. He is proof that sometimes the best
thing that can ever happen to you is to get laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Bolles had absolutely nothing to do with the career advice field
until he and some colleagues were getting laid off from church
jobs. He researched what they should do next and came up with
enough knowledge to write a book. ``What Color Is Your Parachute?''
has sold more than 6 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Chorus Line.'' The long-running Broadway musical had tons
of job-hunting inspiration, but two songs in particular stand out:
``Nothing'' and ``What I Did for Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing'' reminds us that even at a prestigious school, not
every teacher is a gem. The same thing is true at work: Even at a
Fortune 500 company, your boss can be a dolt.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have people at your company who inspire you? If the
answer is no, it means one of two things: You've lost interest in
your career or you've outgrown your company. Make sure you know
which it is before you abandon the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``What I Did for Love,'' sometimes the best thing you can
do is follow your heart _ in careers as well as romances. Sometimes
that also may mean stepping away from a career because it's doing
too much harm to your family or personal life. Don't discount the
power of emotion in deciding whether to stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox Mulder from ``The X-Files.'' Sure, his theories may seem a
little alien to you, but sometimes faith is all you have to help
you overcome your failures and get past your adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Before someone cures cancer, thousands will have tried and
failed, but that doesn't mean their efforts were wasted. Those who
are afraid to fail will never succeed.

   It may prove too much of a task to defend, even trumpet (though
not too loudly) a sitcom that has a dog named Mom who talks in
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy behind ``Oh Grow Up,'' Alan Ball, is the
same guy behind the new movie ``American Beauty,'' which has had
many raves. Of course, we've already shown you that the same man
responsible for the genius of ``Action'' is also behind the
lameness of ``Ladies Man,'' so that argument alone won't wash.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Oh Grow Up'' (Wednesdays, 9:30 p.m. Eastern,
ABC) has the semiprecious distinction of being the second-best
sitcom this fall _ behind ``Action'' _ and primarily because
virtually all others are horrible. Still, as much as it would have
been easy to trounce yet another show about three men in their 30s
trying to find themselves and, hence, grow up, this series did
manage a few less-than-predictable turns along the way and
engendered many more laughs than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really good? No. But it's good. And it's a perfect
lead-out from ``The Drew Carey Show.'' Besides, if you're not
watching the superior dramas _ ``West Wing'' and ``Get Real'' _ on
rival networks, well, you're out of choices. So ``Oh Grow Up'' may
be a hit by default.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say it doesn't deserve your attention or won't
earn hit status on its own, based on, say, a vastly improved second
episode and continued creative growth.
</P>
<P>
   And you may even laugh at the dog's subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Grow Up'' revolves around aging lady's man Hunter (Stephen
Dunham); Norris, the bitter-but-funny artist (Alan Basche); and
Ford (John Ducey), who has just realized he is gay and is starting
divorce proceedings from his angry but funny wife (Rena Sofer).
They all live together, in various states of adulthood. The twist _
well, one of them _ is that Hunter didn't know he fathered an
18-year-old daughter (Niesha Trout).
</P>
<P>
   There is enough here to indicate a possibly funny future.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is enough to indicate you won't remember it by
next week. Time will tell if the series does indeed grow up _ or
keep on living.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady. In her 60s, she was still a
voice to be heard, particularly in support of women and children,
struggling to advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of
post-communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   We spoke in June 1998 at Boston's Copley Plaza Hotel. At the
time Mrs. Gorbachev was full of energy. The translator was the
Gorbachev's longtime personal aide, Pavel Palazchenko.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: We really didn't have first ladies, in the
traditional sense of that term. In many civilized countries _ say,
the United States or Germany or France _ there are laws or
traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and rights of
the wife of the head of state. In Russia, we did not have that.
There were czarinas, there were empresses. Lenin's wife surely had
her own personality, but then came Stalin, and after Stalin, we
very simply did not have any role for the wife of the head of
state. No one knew them, they were invisible and basically
nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the FIRST first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She shows a lot of dignity and
professionalism _ this is an element of character one has to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about my project, Raisa Gorbachev's
Club, a civic group that has been active for almost a year. It was
created by me and a number of wonderful women: authors,
journalists, some members of the State Duma and women who are
social scientists. We aren't an elite club for socializing and not
a political club either. We are a discussion forum to debate the
urgent issues. We are focussing now on an important problem that
has not been properly addressed by government, so we are looking
for support from other people to try to address it: the plight of
Russia's homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the
streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross. He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that
today the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and
creating a kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and
mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross. He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that
today the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and
creating a kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and
mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

   1. 'JAKOB'S' LEADER : ROBIN WILLIAMS FINDS LAUGHTER IN HELL Last
year, Roberto Benigni's award-winning film ``Life Is Beautiful''
proved that there's no place so grim that laughter can't be found
there - not even a Nazi concentration camp. Now Robin Williams -
considered by many to be America's funniest man - is out to prove
that there's more where that came from. His new film, ``Jakob the
Liar'' is based on the tragi-comic novel by Polish-born Jurek
Becker, who spent much of his youth in the Lotz ghetto and wrote
his book while living in East Germany. ``I know people in the most
extraordinarily horrific situations will still have moments of
comedy,'' says Williams. ``It's that somehow-surviving vestige of
humanity that keeps you going in the face of atrocity. ... It's a
very intimate portrayal of life in the face of death.'' By Ivor
Davis. 1,500 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
____________________________________________________________ 2.
MENA SUVARI : 'AMERICAN BEAUTY' ``What I liked about Angela,'' says
actress Mena Suvari about her character in the film ``American
Beauty,'' is that I could bring a lot of myself into the part.
She's very flamboyant and wild and funny and I enjoyed stressing
that playful aspect of her. Angela may appear angelic, but her
long, blond hair and sensuous lips conspire to suggest a teenage
femme fatale. Toying with her best friend's middle-aged father
(played by Kevin Spacey,) who's going through a severe mid-life
crisis, she happily contributes to the image of a sexually
experienced girl determined never to be ``ordinary.'' By Dan Yakir.
BPI. 800 words + photo.
____________________________________________________________ 3.
ROXANN DAWSON RIDES 'THE BARGE OF THE DEAD' Roxann Dawson has been
playing ``Star Trek : Voyager's'' B'Elanna Torres for six years. A
combination of makeup and prosthetic appliances convincingly
transforms her into half-human/half-Klingon (the makeup takes
two-and-a-half hours to apply, and nearly an hour to remove.) In
the episode ``Barge of the Dead,'' she is sent on a treacherous
trek through Klingon hell after a near-death experience. ``The sets
were phenomenal, the story is great and it's very exciting to get
an episode that is not only physically demanding but emotionally
demanding,'' says Torres. By Ian Spelling. 1,000 words + photo.

   4. 'WEST WING' TAKES FLIGHT In Hollywood, some of the most
successful entertainment ideas have been born out of the
traditional high-powered lunch. That was the case when writer Aaron
Sorkin and executive producer John Wells met over a meal two years
ago and decided to attempt a television drama about the inner
workings of the White House. The result of that meeting, ``The West
Wing,'' is set to premiere. With Martin Sheen as the president and
Rob Lowe as deputy communications director, it is one of the most
highly anticipated new series of the autumn season. Sorkin
discourages any comparisons between ``West Wing'' and the Clinton
administration. It does not focus on political issues but on the
people who run the White House, their lives and conflicts. By
Tamara Conniff. BPI. 800 words + photo.
____________________________________________________________ 5.
RECIPE FOR A HIT SITCOM Every year, the TV networks offer dozens of
new comedies and dramas and every year 80 per cent of them are
labelled as failures. Most major hits - including 'MASH,''
``Cheers'' and ``Seinfeld'' - struggled for a full season or longer
to build a decent following. The question is, how do some shows
beat the odds? Is there a recipe for success? By Christopher
Loudon. TV Guide Canada. 1,300 words + photo.
____________________________________________________________ 6.
DAVE MATTHEWS, MAKING MUSIC THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY After nearly 16
months of touring, Dave Matthews wants to go home. He's not
complaining about his success. Matthews has earned a break, having
engineered one of the decade's most succssful rock careers since
forming his band in 1991. Each of the band's five albums has sold
platinum, or better. The Dave Matthews Band has built its success
through the old-fashioned route of hard touring and grassroots
marketing - with a few modern touches. It is a constantly evolving
institution, with a marked experimental streak that many bands
would be afraid to indulge. By Gary Graff. 1,500 words + photo.

FUTURE SCHLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Marin County Emergency Operation Center
recently held a Y2K drill. This was the New Year's Eve disaster
scenario, according to the Mill Valley Herald newspaper: ``Sharks
are at Stinson, a riot's happening at the Mill Valley Safeway, a
tent has fallen on Huey Lewis, and foul-tasting oysters at a
millennium party have made hundreds of people deathly ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad oysters and bad vibes, that's a Marin disaster, and what any
of it has to do with computer clocks is anybody's guess. A riot at
Safeway in Mill Valley? Whole Foods is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   While Marin was preparing for computers to crash, bringing down
Huey Lewis' tent, a real disaster was happening next door to the
Mill Valley Safeway. Mill Valley, the town where the original
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' was set, has had a storefront
snatched by Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   The town has long fought Starbucks, and the Seattle chain
finally snuck one by the Mill Valley Planning Commission, putting a
Starbucks in a Jamba Juice that had permission to have a ``coffee
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks isn't a coffee bar. It's a cultural/retail
infestation, the first sign that a town is going to look like every
other commercial strip in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming soon in Mill Valley: a 6,000-square-foot office and
retail space in a former parking lot near downtown's former train
depot. Just what a nice Bay Area town needs _ less parking, more
cute expensive stuff no one needs.
</P>
<P>
   At least the world might end before the millennium arrives,
sparing us a lot of hype and bad oysters. The latest
end-of-the-world scenario was posed by abcnews.com technology
writer David Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the dot in ``.com'' stands for the grain of salt you
have to take with Net columns.
</P>
<P>
   Melville writes that an ``eccentric'' (the giveaway) physicist
friend is worried because Brookhaven National Laboratory is using a
collider to try to create the conditions that prevailed
milliseconds before the Big Bang, which turned primordial
quark-gluon plasma into the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The scare theory is that this could create a black
hole that would eventually consume the entire Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Naah. Not as scary as ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   the real end of the world will come sometime in 2000 when we
realize that we're in the future and can't imagine anything beyond
it. We'll be like Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff and looking
down, and the stock market will fall with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, UCLA economists just predicted that in 2020
California will have a population of 47.7 million. Who cares? No
one can imagine 2020. And aren't there 47.7 million people in
California now? And just on I-80.
</P>
<P>
   We're all getting an overdose of future schlock.
</P>
<P>
   Major retail controversy: The Sears holiday catalog features a
line of ``Heroes and Villains'' action figures that includes a doll
with a black trench coat, shotgun and rifle _ startlingly similar
to the teen-agers in the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' who shot up the high
school in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Sears halted sales of the trench coat gunman, but you have to
ask what's going on in America. In my day, the Sears catalog didn't
sell criminal dolls with guns. It just sold guns, and was as
all-American as can be.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest historical controversy is over Edmund Morris'
``Dutch,'' the forthcoming authorized biography of Ronald Reagan.
In the book, Morris invents a narrator, conveniently named Edmund
Morris, who follows Reagan like Sancho Panza throughout Reagan's
life _ from Reagan's small Illinois hometown to the White House and
the Reagan ranch.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit, this is the perfect match of style and
subject matter. The alleged narrator meets the alleged president,
and has to listen to all those supposedly true war stories taken
from ``Hellcats of the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional American people await the book with faked
interest.
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was a year later, almost to the week and
the day. Sunday night, same place, the Augusta National golf club.
One man, Jose Maria Olazabal, was accepting the green jacket, the
warm applause at the awards ceremony on the practice green reaching
out beyond Magnolia Lane, the 1999 Masters champion crowned.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, it had been Mark O'Meara slipping on the green
jacket, next heading down the hill to the media building and there
spinning a warm tale of how he had birdied the 17th and 18th holes
on the final round to win the Masters, a feat only Arnold Palmer
had ever accomplished in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the relationship between athletes and the media in other
sports, the relations between the golf media and golfers is more
often warm than brittle, more often understanding than
confrontational. It is because golf is such a lonely battle at the
highest level, but even more it is because golf is so different.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players and basketball players and football and hockey
players receive their millions as much for potential as for
results. It is not so in golf. The only guarantee in golf is that
the man with the fewest strokes wins; golfers are paid for what
they have done, not for what they will do. If Darwin chose to
examine sports, he would have chosen golf where only the strongest
survive. The weak struggle and fight and then fall away.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Meara told his tale of how _ so un-O'Meara-like _ he had
told himself as he approached the 17th tee that he was going to
birdie the final two holes. Then, ``for some reason,'' O'Meara went
on, ``I told my caddie, `I'm going to birdie the last two holes and
win this sucker.' And he kind of looked at me, not with a shocked
mind, but just said, `Yeah, let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The golf media took all this in. The golf media took all this as
a most pleasant surprise because O'Meara was 41 and this likeable
man still had not won a major. Even more, perhaps, it was so
pleasant because O'Meara looks like Everyman, like any number of
men at a golf course on Saturday morning anywhere in America _
middle-aged, a bit of gray in his hair, maybe a pound or two too
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   So a year passed. O'Meara's caddie, the man who said, ``Yeah,
let's go,'' to O'Meara in 1998, again carried O'Meara's bag in the
Masters of 1999, and when Sunday's round was done, this time with a
78 and a tie for 31st place, Jerry Higginbotham put down O'Meara's
bag for the last time after five years of toting it.
</P>
<P>
   He had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   A decision made at Augusta. A year after O'Meara's greatest
triumph, a year in which O'Meara had won both the Masters and the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah . . . yeah,'' said Higginbotham when asked if it still
hurts. ``But it was one of those things where we're trying to keep
it behind us because it's old news. He wanted to do something
different and, for whatever reason he had, it was up to him. He's
the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The caddie paused. He was standing on the front lawn of The
Country Club in Brookline, just moments after he and O'Meara had
bumped into each other shortly after arriving for The Ryder Cup.
The two had chatted amiably for several minutes and appearances
were fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and I had a great five years, and a marvelous last
year,'' said Higginbotham. ``It was a great run with Mark and, as
you just saw, I was talking to him and we were yukking it up.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the firing made sense. O'Meara had had his greatest year
ever and then his caddie was gone. Higginbotham had scratched and
searched and questioned and probed but the only reason he could
come up with was the answer of a true pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it goes out here between the caddies and the
players,'' he said. ``There's a lot of shuffling around. Sometimes
it happens at the top and sometimes it happens at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes in the middle. Because much has changed for Mark
O'Meara in the last year. The toast of golf last year now is
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European media already have reached for their easiest,
most-used and abused stereotype of Americans in describing Mark
O'Meara and his pals in the Stars 'n' Gripes Brigade _ David ``It's
only an exhibition'' Duval, Tiger Woods, and Phil Mickelson _ and
it always comes out in some variation of ``spoiled millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, if the US Ryder Cup team fares poorly this weekend
at The Country Club, the European jibes will be mild compared to
what Americans will toss at the Brookline Four. Their countrymen
will be unsparing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as true, O'Meara heads into the Ryder Cup with the shakiest
game of any of the Brookline Four. He jokes that it's done him
little good lately to aim his drives down the fairways only to find
his golf balls in the rough. Maybe, O'Meara suggested as many a
15-handicapper has done, ``I should aim for the rough'' and then
the ball might find the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, back when O'Meara, 42, was a teenager, he used to have
a dastardly hook off the tee and, as close pal Woods has said to
Golf Digest, ``Mark always has had a fear of the left ball. When
Mark is feeling a little uneasy, Mark tends to slow down his body.
And when he slows down his body, his hands outrace his body, and he
tends to hit the ball just a little left.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Brookline Monday, O'Meara assessed his game
as ``OK. It could be a little bit better, but it's OK. I'm playing
reasonably well. I'm not playing great by any means but I'm playing
all right. We'll see how the practice rounds go.''
</P>
<P>
   So will US captain Ben Crenshaw. Unlike two years ago at
Valderrama, when the pairing of O'Meara and Woods, his Florida
neighbor and all-around pal, seemed ideal (only to have the two
Americans go 1-2 when paired), O'Meara's status this time seems
less lofty. O'Meara even said he would not cause a ruckus if
Crenshaw decides to sit him out for a match or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'll play well when the time needs to be called,''
said O'Meara, who is on his fifth Ryder Cup team. ``I've been
feeling more confident lately. I'm starting to play a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The US team has several players who could utter the same
uninspiring words as O'Meara _ golf that is ``OK but not great'' _
so Crenshaw might take a very close look at O'Meara. O'Meara's best
finish since March has been an 11th place in the Greater Hartford
Open.

 BROOKLINE, Mass.: ... Hartford Open.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As O'Meara conceded, a key reason the Europeans have upset the
United States in the last two Ryder Cups ``is that the European
team has really combined well in the team events, alternate shot
and best ball. And also because they have outputted us and been
very good in their short games.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara even said he would not mind if Crenshaw does not pair
him with Woods, his closest friend. ``I've told the captain I'm
willing to play with any guy on the team,'' said O'Meara. ``I'll be
very flexible with that and I think he'll take a hard look at the
pairings. Whether I play with Tiger is hard to say right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, though, O'Meara will be grouped with Woods, Duval and
Mickelson on the issue of US players being paid. Ironically, even
if Duval has taken the most heat since the issue erupted at the PGA
tournament last month, it was O'Meara who has been a longtime
advocate. Even though Crenshaw and others on the US team have taken
a strong stance on the opposite side, O'Meara said he believes the
team will be unified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about it then (at the PGA) and I'm not
worried about it now,'' O'Meara said of a possible split on the
team. ``Everybody has a different opinion and there's nothing wrong
with that. That's just the way life is. But I still respect my
fellow teammates whether their opinion is the same as mine or not.
And when it comes time to teeing it up on Friday and trying to win,
I think we're all on the same page on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late to change the American image, say observers from across
the Atlantic. The American image has been reinforced _ ``spoiled
millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara may be rich, but spoiled is another matter. As one
prominent woman golfer knows very well, O'Meara has come a long
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mid-1970s, and Billie Jean King had squished Bobby
Riggs in tennis, the women's rights movement was on the rise, and
Jane Blaylock found herself in California for golf's Challenge of
the the Sexes _ Blaylock against Hale Irwin. Only problem was that
Blaylock had no caddie.
</P>
<P>
   A local youth was found, a would-be golfer familiar with the
course ``and I remember seeing this really adorable guy with those
Irish eyes of his,'' recalled Blaylock. ``I was the envy of all the
players. I had the best-looking caddie of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The caddie was Mark O'Meara, then 18, and the two were an ideal
pairing, said Blaylock. She would halve her match with Irwin, and
then Blaylock asked O'Meara to caddie for her in the Dinah Shore
Classic. ``I came in third and Mark got a nice check,'' said
Blaylock, the New Hampshire native who now lives in Boston. ``And I
remember how that check helped Mark out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The two then agreed that O'Meara would caddy for Blaylock on the
LPGA Tour for the summer until O'Meara returned to school. ``But
his daddy wouldn't let him take the (family) truck for the summer,
and he couldn't get around (to the tournaments),'' said Blaylock.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the golfer-caddie relationship was broken, Blaylock kept
in touch with O'Meara and watched his first tentative steps toward
becoming a pro. ``It was like watching my own son,'' said Blaylock.
</P>
<P>
   Years passed and O'Meara would make money, but it was not until
he and Woods learned they were neighbors in the same exclusive
community near Orlando that O'Meara was able to take the final step
to the top. Woods lit a fire in O'Meara, who's nearly twice his
age, while O'Meara was a solidifying influence on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and Tiger help each other all the time,'' said
Higginbotham. ``They work together all the time. They know each
other's game like no one else does. They play practice rounds
together. Most of all, they're best friends and a lot of people
don't realize that, but they really are true, best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It has speculated that O'Meara's slide this year after a
spectacular 1998 may be attributed to his . . . well, obsession
with money. At the NEC Invitational last month in Akron, Ohio, for
instance, O'Meara lodged in an $80-a-night Comfort Inn which,
although close to the Firestone Country Club site, was a far cry
from the plusher lodgings where the other golfers stayed. O'Meara
also went shopping for necessities at a K-Mart in a mall near the
Comfort Inn.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has traveled hundreds of thousands of miles in the 17
months since winning the Masters, taking home lucrative appearance
money on foreign shores (PGA events in America do not give
appearance money), traveling from Dubai to Ireland, where O'Meara
earns 50,000 Irish pounds, for instance, from Bord Failte, the
Irish tourist board. He also has appeared at scores of corporate
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having the great year he had, it's been pretty much a
proven pattern as other golfers have found out,'' said
Higginbotham. ``You see it on the PGA Tour all the time; there's
always a letdown after a great year. It's happened to all the
greats of the game. But, to be honest with you, I don't think Mark
has had a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, O'Meara has yet to win in 1999. He and the others of the
Brookline Four have been pilloried. He got rid of his caddie of
five years, the last of those five years very good. And he comes to
The Country Club not sure of his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens this weekend in Brookline just might define all
of 1999 for O'Meara. His year very quickly could get much worse . .
. or much better. Money, or no money.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The hats are the same as they were two years
ago in Valderrama. The American players wear caps that have their
last names stitched on the back (T. Woods, D. Duval), while the
backs of the European caps read, ``European Team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryder Cup golf. The best of America vs. the best of Europe. Or,
as our friends across the sea like to think, (itals)individual
stars vs. team players.(unitals
</P>
<P>
   More than any international competition _ more than the
Olympics, the World Cup or the Davis Cup _ this is the event that
reinforces all the stereotypes that (itals)they,(unitals) the
Euros, have about (itals)us,(unitals) the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is a broad brush and Americans are painted as bloated,
uptight, overconfident, impatient, and totally lacking in team
spirit. Meanwhile, the Europeans are perceived as fun-loving,
hungry, self-made, and passionate about team play.
</P>
<P>
   The Euros are beer-swilling, chain-smoking frat boys who play
for the love of the game. The Americans are the 1978 Red Sox of 25
players, 25 cabs . . . ultra-privileged, overpaid, prone to choke,
and totally insulated from anything connected with real world and
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget two years ago, when an Italian cardboard box
maker, Costantino Rocca, kicked Tiger Woods's butt all the way to
the Mediterranean Sea on Super Sunday in Valderrama? You think the
Europeans didn't love that? It's classic, little-guy-beats-big-guy
stuff and the Euros love to throw it in our faces.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, the Americans are making it tough on
themselves. In September's American Golf Digest, US player Payne
Steward said of the European team, ``On paper, they shouldn't be
caddying for us.'' Tuesday, Jeff Maggert said, ``Let's face it,
we've got the 12 best players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The British tabloids no doubt are having a field day with that
one. It's the golf equivalent of Dick Williams saying his 1967 Game
7 plan was ``Lonborg and Champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month's Mess in Medinah only fortified all of Europe's
disgust with the American team. Perhaps you remember the cat fight
at the PGA Championship when American ace David Duval complained
about no pay for the players and called the Ryder Cup an
``exhibition.'' Duval also said ``it would take players not
playing'' to forge a change in the compensation issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, at that time, added that he would like to see
competitors paid anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000, and be able to
do whatever they saw fit with the money. He said he would donate it
to charity. Meanwhile, fellow American Phil Mickelson wanted to
know who negotiated the deal that paid millions to The Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of all top Ryder candidates, US captain Ben
Crenshaw said he was ``personally disappointed in a couple of
people,'' then made it clear exactly who he was talking about. Mark
O'Meara was stunned that Crenshaw ratted him out.
</P>
<P>
   After the Medinah mess, Brit Nick Faldo, a veteran of Europe's
last two Ryder victories, shrugged his Harrison Ford shoulders and
said, ``And they wonder why they can't win this team event.''
European captain Mark James added, ``We're not going into the Ryder
Cup for money. Never have been . . . We're losing touch with
reality, some people, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Euros had only one pre-Cup controversy and it involved
whether the players' caddies would be allowed to fly to America
with the team on the Concorde. Lee Westwood was among those players
who fought for the caddies and said, ``Team spirit is the advantage
the Europeans always have over the Americans.'' Alas, Westwood and
pals lost the fight for the little people, but again, the contrast
with the selfish Americans could not be more clear.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was backing away from the pay-for-play issue Tuesday,
but the wounds are still there and it's extra pressure for the
American lads.
</P>
<P>
   American Justin Leonard said, ``We're here to play the matches
and compensation is longer part of this with the players.''
Crenshaw said, ``All thoughts are playing together for the Cup and
it's been that way for a while. It dissipated very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one couldn't help but notice that Woods, Duval, O'Meara,
and Mickelson _ the Medinah Four _ played a practice round together
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval weren't pressed on the compensation question,
but denied that the Europeans play this event with more passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of that stuff is made up,'' said the pulseless
Duval. ``We try just as hard as they do. That's a disservice to the
European team, to say that when they win. It's disrespectful to
their play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we are less passionate than they are,'' added
Woods. ``We try just as hard as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The American stars were quite accomodating and Duval even poked
fun at himself a few times. But they have to know the pressure is
mounting. They have said the Euros shouldn't be caddying for them.
They have said they have the 12 best golfers in the world. They
have complained about compensation. And they wear hats that promote
themselves instead of their team.

RYDER HAD FAITH IN HIS IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Golf? God bless us, golf?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, in a manner of speaking. Religion had played a part
in this whole unlikely evolution, just as it had reached into every
nook and cranny of his life, 68-year-old Samuel Ryder mused with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if he hadn't been reluctantly persuaded to take up
the game by his parson, Rev. Frank Wheeler, in St. Albans almost 20
years ago, he most assuredly wouldn't be sitting here now, on the
veranda of the young Wentworth Golf Club, beneath the imposing
ramparts that dominated its concrete castle design. He wouldn't be
gazing out at the East Course, completed just a few months ago by
Harry Shapland Colt but already a gem in the affluent Surrey
countryside, awaiting the start of these informal team matches
between the finest American and British professional golfers prior
to the 1926 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews had decreed that
for the first time, qualifying would be necessary for this Open,
and the Americans had fulfilled that obligation at Sunningdale,
just a couple of miles from Wentworth, and had some time to kill.
So the flamboyant, garrulous Walter Hagen, representing the United
States, and Wentworth pro George Duncan, along with Ryder's
personal instructor, Abe Mitchell, had arranged this competition.
Had arranged the particulars of it, that is, for the genesis of it
had come from Samuel Ryder. The London Daily Telegraph had reported
his grand intention of someday matching the best of the US and
Great Britain in a team competition back in 1925, and while the
opportunity hadn't presented itself then, this little gap in the
schedule had proved ideal.
</P>
<P>
   It had been announced in the Times of London two months ago that
Ryder would present a trophy to the winner of these international
matches June 4 and 5, and this morning's Times had trumpeted the
first day of competition under the headline ``Ryder Cup.'' Truth be
told, there was no cup _ just 5 pounds for each participant and 5
more to each member of the winning team. But there certainly was a
Ryder, and these matches were a tribute to him _ he had,
appropriately enough, sown the seeds for them _ though he didn't
see it that way. He considered them a tribute to God and to a
lifelong desire to help the less fortunate. Which, he had
discovered almost by accident, included the British touring pros.
That came years after he discovered golf. Under protest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown had been no surprise, really. Sam Ryder had
devoted many of his 50 years to the roles of businessman and
benefactor with compulsive zeal, so the collapse, the sheer
exhaustion that caused it, was perhaps inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   When his doctor ordered that he take up some form of exercise as
a diversion from his more serious pursuits, Ryder naturally had
settled upon cricket. He had played the sport while growing up near
Manchester in northern England, one of eight children of a
nurseryman of middling success, and he had loved it. But he hadn't
played it in years, and the strain at his age, his physician
informed him, might kill him before it cured him. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   How about golf? suggested Rev. Wheeler, an aficionado of the
game and Ryder's longtime friend. Preposterous, countered Ryder.
Golf? Why, it was nothing but orienteering with a stick. Such a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   But while he didn't consider his minister infallible in such
secular matters, he finally agreed, just to appease him. And,
wonder of wonders, he found himself captivated by the game. He
couldn't quite explain the attraction _ then again, who could truly
pinpoint the source of an obsession? _ but he became consumed by
it, just as he had his other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he didn't go public, not right away. Instead, he had a
200-yard hole installed behind the magnificent Marlborough House,
which he had leased since 1905, and ordered a hedge planted as part
of it so he could practice his chipping. Then he brought in the
local pro from Verulam Golf Club, a fellow named Hill _ for the
life of him, he couldn't recall the poor man's first name _ to
tutor him. Hill soon left the scene, replaced by his successor at
Verulam, Charles Wallis, and Ryder continued his private education
until he felt ready to reveal himself as a true golfer.
</P>
<P>
   He had been that way in everything he did. The seed business,
for instance. He had begun his career with large companies in
Manchester and then London, even while retaining an interest in his
father's concern, and he had traveled Europe extensively. His tours
of the Continent had inspired a brainstorm _ why not sell seeds in
small packets, at a penny each, so that the common man could afford
a garden just as surely as the wealthy? His father had advised
against it, but Sam was not to be dissuaded. He left the family
business in Sale, Cheshire, and relocated to St. Albans, in the
county of Hertfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   He did not pick this spot by happenstance. He studied a map and
chose the town because of its strategic location on a direct
railway line that went from London all the way up to Scotland, thus
serving as a center of transport. He and his wife, Helen, moved
into a tiny house at 5 Folly Lane and, ignoring the mocking irony
of this address, went to work. They would package the seeds at
home, then carry them in a clothes basket to the post office each
Friday night so that they would be available to would-be customers
by Saturday afternoon _ the one half-day off each week the British
workingman received.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was pure genius. The business eventually grew into a
worldwide success, and along the way, Ryder moved into larger
quarters, first into a chapel that had opened in 1697 but now was
in disuse, then to 27 Holywell Hill, the site of an inn once
visited by Queen Elizabeth in 1577. Later he would branch out,
forming Heath and Heather Ltd., which sold herbs for medicinal use.
Among its products was a smoking mixture that was supposed to
facilitate sweet dreams, and when English Customs tried to curtail
it as a violation of regulations regarding the sale of tobacco
products, Ryder went to court. The case was a cause celebre, and
the media attention it generated guaranteed the success of the
product.
</P>
<P>
   But he was more than a financial wizard. He took pity on the
poor, though he once patronizingly referred to them as ``much
better people than we thought they were,'' and he was among the
first employers to grant vacation and health benefits. Skeptics
warned him that this was foolhardy, that the workers would take
advantage of him, but he said simply, ``Well, let them.'' In fact,
the opposite proved true _ most of his 350 employees developed an
intense loyalty to him, far more so than did the town fathers.
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans was built near the ruins of Verulainam, once the
third-largest city in the British portion of the Roman Empire, and
its centerpiece was an abbey originally constructed in 900. In a
town of such history and heritage, Ryder was an interloper,
regarded warily because of his occasional indulgences in northern
bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't prevent him from becoming one of the town's
leading citizens, grudgingly as that prominence may have come.
Eight years after his arrival in 1895, he was elected to the city
council, and in 1905, his fellow councilors selected him mayor. He
wasted no time expressing his contempt for the governing body that
had elevated him, saying in his acceptance speech that it was a
lifeless organization.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, he engaged in gentle sarcasm, though some
mistook it for abrasiveness. And he was at heart a kind man,
devoted to his family: Helen and their three daughters _ Marjorie,
Kay, and Joan, the youngest and, he had to admit, his favorite. He
often would play the piano during the evening while the girls
played cards. Finding that their bickering over the games sometimes
became intolerable, he had a trophy made up _ a glass vase with the
inscription ``No Grumbling'' _ and it would be awarded once a week
to whichever of the three was adjudged to have complained the
loudest.
</P>
<P>
   That was an example of his humor, and if people couldn't accept
it, that was their problem. But he was more given to acts of
benevolence. Upon arriving in St. Albans, he immediately became
Sunday school superintendent of the Spicer Street Chapel _a
Congregationalist church, for he followed a nonconformist doctrine,
no matter how it sat with the Church of England. He put his
business skills to work overseeing the expansion of the Spicer
Street facility and eventually funding the larger Trinity Church.
</P>
<P>
   Even an act of apparent self-importance was in fact the practice
of charity. During his term as mayor, Ryder followed the tradition
of the times and had a portrait of himself in his magisterial robes
commissioned. It was a huge oil painting in which he resembled a
head of church or state, a monument to pomposity, his critics said.
But it was actually vital employment for the artist, Francis
Saulsbury, who had fallen upon hard times since doing a portrait of
Ryder's daughters. Saulsbury's career was revived, and some of his
works eventually were displayed in the Royal Academy of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder preached these tenets at home, and when one of his
daughters would complain about doing something, he would say,
``Never mind, child, it's part of the discipline of life.''

WORCESTER WAS THE PERFECT HOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ There are pictures and framed letters to
remind guests that they have walked into a cherished home of
yesteryear. Clocks can be found, if you need to have the day's
time, but calendars are not required. At Worcester Country Club, it
can be any year your imagination desires, for a century's worth of
character, charm, and elegance is beneath every step taken on the
golf course and behind every door of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ross created this marvelous golf course, which has been
preserved by grateful guardians, and there are still some who may
have been there that September day in 1914 when President William
H. Taft struck the first drive. It was here, in 1925, that golf's
greatest legend, Robert Tyre Jones Jr., contributed the most
gracious act of sportsmanship the game has ever seen. Fourteen
years later, Byron Nelson won a Mass. Open over these hallowed
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those gentlemen who arrived in early June of
1927. A proud group of Brits, they had taken a ship, the Aquitania,
across the Atlantic, disembarking in Manhattan. A few days later,
following a look at Babe Ruth and the Yankees and some golf in
Westchester, the men found themselves in the rolling hills of
central Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to play golf for honor. They had come to play golf
for pride. They had come to play the first official Ryder Cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   At Worcester Country Club? Why Worcester?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't documented, but the reason seems to be threefold.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the players agreed on Worcester CC since many of
them had taken part in the US Open there two years earlier. (That
was the Open in which Jones called a penalty stroke on himself and
was forced into a playoff, which he lost to Willie MacFarlane.)
</P>
<P>
   Logistically, Worcester made sense because the US Open would be
held two weeks later at Oakmont in Pennsylvania, and the Brits
could use the matches as a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Worcester's head professional at the time was Willie
Ogg, a legendary figure. He was a Scotsman who was friendly with
many of the Brits, while also involved with the PGA of America. It
stands to reason that he had an influence on the decision to bring
this international golf match to Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever got them to Worcester serves as trivial backdrop to
the reality that indeed, on June 3-4, 1927, a golf competition was
born right here in Massachusetts. Eighteen professional golfers
with their fashionable knickers and ties, their mashies and
niblicks, their loose swings and combative spirits started
something that they could not recognize if they were with us today.
</P>
<P>
   None of them are, of course, not with the passing this spring of
Gene Sarazen at the age of 97. He had been the last remaining
player from that 1927 competition. ``A wonderful man,'' recalls
Fred Hill, who at 89 is one of the few who can remember that 1927
Ryder Cup. ``He was a little nervous, a bit cocky, but he was very
generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill caddied for Sarazen in 1927 and received $80. The money he
gave to his mother; the memories he still has.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were local, national, and international events going on in
June of 1927 that commanded attention, so it would be a great
exaggeration to say the first Ryder Cup match dominated news. Not
with the country still trumpeting Charles Lindbergh's historic
flight while also monitoring the plight of Clarence Chamberlin,
lost in travel. There was also the death of the infamous Lizzie
Borden. Charlie Chaplin had himself in a messy marital mess, and
the Sacco-Venzetti case was a hot topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, golf was a pleasant distraction and this Ryder Cup seemed
a curious thing. Certainly it was to a couple of Worcester CC
members, brothers Bill and Tom Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   They are 91 and 84, respectively, but they were schoolboys 72
years ago and since their dad was a member at Worcester CC, it was
an easy decision to attend the matches. Bill was a golfer and
wanted to see the great players of the era _ Walter Hagen and
Johnny Farrell, Ted Ray and Aubrey Boomer. ``That was the main
reason I came out,'' he said, ``to watch them play and improve my
game. I wanted to copy those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, the US playing captain, was every bit the showman and
star attraction history makes him out to be, said the Kelleher
brothers. He arrived every day in a chauffeur-driven limo,
``accompanied by a pretty woman,'' they said, and was good to the
kids who shagged balls for him at the range.
</P>
<P>
   One of those shaggers was Frank Blanchard, who had hoped to
caddie in the event, though he settled on work at the range.
``Hagen gave me a dozen balls. I wish to hell I still had them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Blanchard: ``I remember he drank a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean all he could,'' said Al McIntyre, now 84 but a mere
12 years old when he snuck a peak that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was shrewd,'' said Bill Kelleher. ``When he'd hit a
ball in the rough he'd look at it, walk back and forth, and the
gallery would follow his every step. Back and forth. Back and
forth. This was before ropes so people got close. After a while,
when he'd get around to hitting his ball, the grass would be matted
down.''
</P>
<P>
   There were good crowds, the men recalled, and newspaper accounts
of the day put the figure at 2,000. Some reports had it at 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   What the event did lack was close competition. The Americans,
humbled terribly by a 13 1/2-1 1/2score in an informal match the
year before at Gleneagles in Scotland, won three of four foursomes
matches on Friday. The next day, despite the cool, damp, and windy
weather that seemed to make the Brits feel at home, the Homebreds _
as they had come to be called _ won six of eight singles matches,
halved another, and completed a 9 1/2-2 1/2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play of the American golfers, once the ball had reached
the green, was a revelation,'' is how Boston reporters saw it. ``It
was here that the homebred product excelled and was really the
advantage that enabled the Americans to score such an impressive
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to Ray: ``They putted in much better
form than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The rout was set in motion early as Farrell and Joe Turnesa
dealt an 8 and 6 blow to what was supposedly Great Britain's best
duo _ George Duncan and Archie Compston. Sarazen and Al Waltrous
followed with a 3 and 2 win over Arthur Havers and Herbert Jolly,
which more than offset the only US loss _ Lei Diegel and Bill
Mehlhorn getting whipped, 7 and 5, by Boomer and Charles Whitcombe.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre recalls watching Boomer walk shoeless from the
clubhouse to the first tee. ``He forgot his golf shoes and had to
run in quickly for them. He rushed to the first tee and didn't have
time for a practice swing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worcester CC sits proudly amid rolling hills, pampered and cared
for by a membership that treasures its every square inch. It is
just a 40-minute ride from The Country Club in Brookline, where the
33d Ryder Cup matches will attract tens of thousands of people in a
multimillion dollar event that bares little resemblance to what
took place 72 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Bancroft Hotel in Worcester, where the players stayed
and had their pre-match banquet in 1927, is now an office building.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hill stopped playing the game two years ago ``because it's
no fun to play bogey golf when you used to be good,'' though he is
helping his daughter with the game. He walks with a cane but can,
at a moment's notice, go into his still-fluid golf swing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kelleher fell two years ago and had to quit playing, though
he vows to return to the tee. His brother Tom plays frequently,
quite often with Al as they trade off member-guests at their
respective clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Blanchard, who was witness to the 1927 Ryder Cup, died
at the age of 88, shortly after sharing his 1927 memories. ``You
should have seen Hagen,'' said Blanchard. ``He was something.''

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As usual, Bruce Armstrong was on to
something Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the keenest analyst of the Patriots' situation at any
given moment, the veteran left tackle assessed his team's
remarkable second-half comeback against the Indianapolis Colts from
the perspective of Pete Carroll, New England's beleaguered head
coach, and concluded, ``If you're going to blame him for the
losses, you have to give him credit for the victories.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is quite right.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the 1999 NFL season is far from decided. As dead
as the Jets look at the moment and as alive as the Patriots seem
today, anything can happen in 14 weeks, and not all of it will be
good. If you go by the first two weeks, the Washington Redskins are
ready to become one of the most prolific scoring offenses in NFL
history. If you go by the first two weeks, the New York Giants
could give up triple-figure numbers to New England's offense Sunday
night. Neither is likely to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the first two weeks can be a portent or a mirage,
and unlike past years, Carroll seemed to sense that Monday, 24
hours after his team rallied from a 28-7 deficit to a 31-28
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the cheerleader's empty-headed enthusiasm for all
things good and the fan's blind eye to all things negative. Within
four sentences, it was reality time for his players and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2-0, but we're not satisfied with the way we're
playing,'' Carroll said. ``We need a lot of improvement. We have to
show improvement if we're going to go anywhere. We can't continue
to hurt ourselves and count on coming out with miraculous wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Had Don Shula suddenly invaded Carroll's body? Had Bear Bryant _
whose team never had a chance of beating anybody, to hear him say
it _ somehow risen from the dead and come back in the shape of
Pistol-Packing, I'm-Feelin'-Dangerous Pete?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has coached and approached things differently so far
this year than he did in his first two seasons. He is more the
father and less the understanding uncle. He is more the taskmaster
and less the overnight-camping-trip organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll will never be a jut-jawed Shula. That is not his
personality. But he appears to have learned much the past two years
about command, and at least one lesson is the simplest of all but
the hardest for a coach to accept: that the players are his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   They don't mean to be. Seldom do they want to be. But players
are players, and by their very nature they put a coach at risk
because their agenda is not always his agenda. They play for a
living. The coach works for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll finally seems to have figured that out, having pushed
his players harder this summer and being less willing to accept
whatever lame excuse they have for failure. Asked about the spate
of first-half penalties that helped put his team in a hole Sunday,
Carroll didn't do what he'd done so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't defend the players. He didn't squawk about the
officials or split the hair of this or that ruling. Instead he
pointed out that many were aggressive penalties rather than merely
stupid ones but added, ``It's overaggressiveness. We'll have
officials on the field this week.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Carroll was not assuming the penalty problem
would go away just because boys will be boys and the fellas really
wanna do good and let's get after 'em and you'll see now.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was simply, ``We'll have officials on the field,''
meaning he would import some local high school and college
officials to work practice this week, throwing flags when players
cross the line to remind them of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say he hasn't done similar things in the past.
The difference is, this year he's doing what the best coaches in
sports do. He's making his players accountable, and publicly so.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and the Patriots are no strangers to fast starts. They
have opened at 4-1 each of his first two years, and they are 2-0
with the Giants and lowly Browns coming up in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But those 4-1 teams went 2-8 in the seasons' next quarter,
having grown full of themselves in part from the blind praise
heaped upon them by their boss in the face of their obvious
deficiencies. It would appear that will not be the case this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, it is not how you start that counts; it's where you
finish. Carroll seems to understand that more clearly. He is still
excited to win the way he did the past two weekends _ on late field
goals _ but he is mindful that games like that can just as easily
be lost. While it is traditional to talk about ``character'' (one
of the most overused words in sports) when a team wins with a
last-second field goal, no one wants to talk about a lack of
character when it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Carroll avoided that word while talking about New
England's latest thrilling win. Instead he framed it the way it
needed to be framed _ draped as much in black as in red, white, and
blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the two turnovers, we wouldn't have been able to
win,'' Carroll cautioned. ``We would have run out of time. I'd like
to tell you I knew it was going to happen, but I was surprised in
general we were able to turn the game around.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, though not what the public was used to hearing from
Carroll, should be welcome ones because they were the truth, just
as he told his team the truth at halftime when he made it clear it
wasn't the coaches' plan that was the problem but the players'
execution of it.
</P>
<P>
   Success in coaching hinges on how well the players do what is
asked of them. The coach's job is to be sure they understand what
that is and to make sure they do it. Realizing this, Carroll
slightly adjusted the defense into a more basic attack and told the
players the rest was up to them.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the rest of the job is reminding them what reality
is. Pete Carroll did that Monday by looking at his team and its
stirring victory and its 2-0 start for what it really was _ a
dangerous route to keep taking if they want to keep winning.
</P>
<P>
   They may not have wanted to hear it, but them's the facts, and
it was reassuring to hear them coming from the boss.

HISTORY CALLS FOR CAUTION ON ALLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you reach 30 years of age and make a living by running a
football, there are only so many carries left. The next could be
your last.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Allen is 31 and has been banged around as much as, if not
more than, any other running back in the league in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   He may be the only runner in the NFL with two completely
reconstructed knees. One total repair job can mean the end of the
line. Two almost always does. But not for Allen, who has made
important contributions to the Patriots in their heart-pounding,
last-gasp victories in the first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Back in training camp, when Allen was being talked about as a
possibility with the Patriots, I checked with his previous
employers, the Washington Redskins, and was told the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry could still do it for a limited number of carries and
not over an entire season. The last two years with us, he started
strong and then started to wear down and couldn't finish the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   A check of the records shows that Allen played just 10 games
each of the last two seasons. He surrendered his body too many
times and couldn't make it to the end.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Allen has been on top of his game. Maybe missing all
of training camp has rejuvenated him. In the opener against the
Jets, he had a clutch 22-yard touchdown burst in the second half on
a third-and-short situation, which was typical of what Allen can do
for a team.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is not a speed burner. Never has been. But he is a tough,
physical runner who hits the holes and linebackers with abandon, a
pinball runner, fighting for every inch. He also has excellent
vision, and from his vast experience he knows when, and where, to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, he has carried 30 times for 128 yards and caught
three passes, one for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   How about making Allen the ``closer''? Bring him in on
short-yardage and goal-line situations for three periods, then let
him finish in the fourth, when the opposition is wearing down. It
would seem to be a perfect role for him, one that could get him
through the season healthy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel was not a happy camper Tuesday. ``We
just played a terrible game against Washington,'' said Fassel. ``I
didn't think we could play like that. That's the worst defensive
game we've had since I've been here. On both sides of the ball, it
looked like they were quick and fast, and we were in slow motion.
It was that way the whole game.'' The Giants were smacked by the
Redskins, 50-21, and come to Foxborough, Mass. to play the Patriots
Sunday night. ``We better step up our game higher than it has been
up there on Sunday night. They are playing very well. (Drew)
Bledsoe is playing in control and in rhythm. He's the best in the
league right now. I don't think anyone's playing better or with
more confidence. You can watch him on film and just see the
confidence. As a team, they've been making a lot of plays. The guys
around him have been getting open. Terry Glenn's been getting 100
yards, and when that happens, they usually win.'' The Giants won
their opener in Tampa Bay, but after a good showing on offense in
the exhibition season, they have been bogged down. ``All of last
year we were last in the league on converting third downs,'' said
Fassel. ``At the end of preseason, we were No. 1. Now we are having
a tough time again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A big plus for the Giants this weekend will be the long-awaited
return of Jason Sehorn, a Pro Bowl cornerback in 1997. In 1998, he
talked the Giants into letting him return kickoffs (read this, Ty
Law), and on the very first one, in an exhibition game, he blew his
knee apart and missed all of last season. This year, after working
out hard and bulking up to 225 pounds, Sehorn pulled a hamstring in
camp and hasn't played. ``He wanted to play last week and could
have played last week,'' said Fassel. ``But I told him he has not
played in over a year, and I thought he would be better sitting out
one more week. If he had played all last year and missed a few
weeks of training camp, I would have played him Sunday. But I
thought this would be better.'' In the past, the Giants have moved
Sehorn around to match up with the other team's best receiver. ``It
could happen in this game,'' mused Fassel. ``Jason and Terry Glenn.
Now that would be pretty good.'' If that happens, Sehorn's
hamstring had better be 100 percent.

<HEADLINE>
THE STRATEGY, FORMAT OF RYDER MATCH PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a casual golf fan and tune into the Ryder Cup
matches, you may be confused. Unlike the weekly tournament play you
may watch, whereby individuals have scores such as 4-under or
2-over, the Ryder Cup will be match play. A beginner's guide:
</P>
<P>
   MATCH PLAY _ The idea here is to win holes, regardless of total
score in relation to par. If European Colin Montgomerie makes a 4,
and American David Duval makes a 5, Montgomerie wins the hole. If
the players tie, the hole is ``halved.'' The match continues until
a player is ahead by more holes than there are left to play. For
example: If Montgomerie leads by three holes and there are just two
remaining, he wins by a score of 3 and 2. The same scoring format
holds true whether they are playing singles or team. There will be
three types of competition over the three days:
</P>
<P>
   Singles (12 matches, all on Sunday) _ Played as above.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foursomes (8 matches total, 4 each on Friday and Saturday
mornings) _ More commonly called ``alternate shot,'' this format
pits two players from Europe in a match against two from the US,
with each team playing one ball. Let's say the match is Montgomerie
and Lee Westwood vs. Duval and Tiger Woods. The teams on their own
decide who hits first off the first tee. For the sake of arguemnt,
let's say Westwood hits first. Montgomerie would then hit the
second shot, Westwood the third, and so on until the hole is
finished. Same thing for the US _ Duval and Woods would alternate
until the hole is holed. Again, it would be low score on the hole
that wins. Each team alternates as to who shoots first on the hole,
regardless of who shot last on the previous hole.
</P>
<P>
   Four-ball (8 matches total, 4 each on Friday and Saturday
afternoons) _ More commonly called ``best ball,'' it again involves
two players against two players. In this format, however, all the
players play their own ball, with the low score counting for the
team. Thus, if Montgomerie makes 4 and Westwood a 5, Europe counts
the 4. If Duval makes 4 and Woods a 3, the US counts the 3 and wins
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING SIDES _ On Thursday evening, each captain will choose
four teams of two from among his 12 golfers to compete in Friday
morning's ``foursomes.'' He will secretly designate them to play
1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and submit his list to officials, who then will
announce the pairings (Europe No. 1 vs. US No. 1, etc.). After the
Friday morning matches are played, captains will then select their
four two-man teams for the Friday afternoon ``four-ball'' and may
choose any player, whether they played in the morning or not. The
same selection process will hold true for Saturday's matches. The
pairings for the 12 Sunday singles matches will be submitted by the
captains late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GLOSSARY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Common Ryder Cup-related golf terms you may hear throughout the
week and what they mean:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Match play _ This is the overall format of the event. Players
try and win holes by getting lower scores. The match is won by
whoever has the most holes, not the player with the lower score.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All square _ Means the match is even.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up _ You will hear this a lot. It means you have won these many
more holes than your opponent. Davis Love and Mark O'Meara are ``2
up'' in their match with Paul Lawrie and Andrew Coltart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 and 3 _ A score you may hear during match play. Darren Clarke
defeats Jeff Maggert by ``4 and 3'' means he was four holes up with
three holes to play, thus Maggert cannot overcome the deficit and
the match is over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Win a hole _ Your score is lower than your opponents, thus you
``win'' a hole. Whether you are one, two or three strokes lower is
of no matter. It counts for one hole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Halve _ A tie. Payne Stewart makes four on a hole and so does
his opponent. They ``halve'' the hole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dormie _ It means you cannot do worse than a tie, that you lead
your oppponent by as many holes as there are left to play. Colin
Montgomerie is 3 up with three holes to play. Thus, Montgomerie is
dormie, for if he loses all three holes, the worst he would do is
halve the match.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concede _ To acknowledge that you cannot beat your opponent on a
hole. Davis Love is 20 feet away, putting for a bogey, but Lee
Westwood is 10 feet away and has two putts for par. Love
acknowledges that Westwood will do no worse than 2-putt for a 4,
thus he concedes the hole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Honors _ To hit first off the tee is to have honors. At the
first tee, this is determined by tournament officials, but on holes
thereafter the low score has honors. If the previous hole was a
halve, whomever had honors keeps them.

YOU, TOO INVENTED THE NET? GET IN LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pack of engineers, venture capitalists, and officers of star
on-line companies such as Yahoo Inc. and Amazon.com are gathering
this week to celebrate three decades of the Internet _ or something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   The event is billed as the Internet's 30th birthday party and is
pegged to experiments that took place in the fall of 1969, when the
first bits of digitized text were sent between computer
laboratories in Los Angeles and Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   From that halting beginning, the new medium now reaches almost
200 million people worldwide. The party in Atherton, Calif., will
commemorate the explosion with speeches, investment announcements,
and a menu including coconut-beer shrimp and conch fritters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's booming success has also prompted more
scrutiny of its origins _ and touched off some rather unfestive
bickering.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it turns out not everyone regards 1969 as the
Internet's birth year. Historian Janet Abbate, whose ``Inventing
the Internet'' was just published by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Press, thinks October 1972 might be regarded as a better
boot-up period.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a military predecessor to the Internet called the
ARPANET was the subject of a conference in Washington. Unlike the
1969 experiments, the 1972 gathering sparked much public interest
in electronic communications, Abbate says. ``To my mind, that's
when it gets up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   About the upcoming Silicon Valley festival, she said, ``I feel
kind of like `whoop-de-do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, debates over the history of cyberspace were
confined to narrow engineering circles. No longer: the massive
attention and cash directed to on-line projects have prompted a
rush by everyone from university deans to presidential candidate Al
Gore to talk up their early associations with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that history's about to be written here and
they don't want to be left out,'' said Lyman Chapin, chief
technology officer for a GTE Corp. unit that is the successor to
Bolt, Beranek &AMP; Newman Inc., the Cambridge defense contractor that
built some of the first networking computers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the chronology of events that created the network of
networks now known as the Internet isn't in dispute. But parcelling
out credit for these advances is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no squabbling over the facts, there's only squabbling
over branding,'' said Robert Kahn, who helped write the key
Internet protocol known as TCP/IP to enable computers to talk to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Already competing claims have led to revisions. For instance,
MCI WorldCom Inc. for years had referred to its senior vice
president Vint Cerf as ``the father of the Internet.'' There was
some basis for the description: Cerf founded the Internet Society
in 1992 and shared a National Technology Medal with Kahn in 1997
for their work on TCP/IP in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Cerf's former colleagues complained Worldcom's
description excluded others. A few months ago WorldCom made an edit
to its site on the World Wide Web and now describes Cerf as being
``widely known as a `father of the Internet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cerf says he asked for the change in order to reflect the work
of others, including Kahn, who gets much less attention in his
current post as president of the nonprofit Corporation for National
Research Initiatives in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work was not done in a vacuum,'' Cerf wrote in a recent
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not good enough for some, including Leonard
Kleinrock, a computer science professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles. In academic papers in the early 1960s,
Kleinrock first described the technique known as
``packet-switching,'' chopping up messages into small digital
pieces to speed them over telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   He also oversaw some of the first experiments in 1969, and, as a
result, Kleinrock calls himself the person ``most responsible'' for
the creation of the Internet, along with Larry Roberts, who
developed the ARPANET. Kahn and Cerf rank no better than third-most
and fourth-most influential, respectively, Kleinrock says, and
shouldn't be credited with paternity in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be the father you need to both help conceive and
be present at the birth,'' Kleinrock said. As far as the Internet
goes, he said, ``I was at both!''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a faction of engineers who regard Cerf and
Kleinrock both as theoretical hangers-on. ``All they were really
saying was `maybe those things could work,' '' says Frank Heart, a
retired engineer from Bolt, Beranek.
</P>
<P>
   As Heart sees it, the translation of networking theory into
practice was done by Roberts' and Heart's own Bolt, Beranek group.
Beginning in 1969, they built what were called ``interface message
processors,'' small devices to connect bigger computers to
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the difference between Einstein saying E(EQ)MC
squared and the people at Los Alamos who actually built the atom
bomb,'' Heart said.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of atomic weapons, another debate relates to what
extent the Internet derives from Cold War military research to help
command-and-control systems survive a nuclear first strike. The
issue centers on the contributions made by Paul Baran, a Rand Corp.
employee who published a survivability study for the Pentagon in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Baran's work and that of a British researcher later caught the
attention of Roberts when he was managing ARPANET and led him to
hire Baran as an adviser. But in later years, people trying to
build the Internet's commercial credibility became uncomfortable
with the Internet's association with nuclear-warfighting.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Roberts minimizes the influence of Baran's survivability
research. On a Web site describing Baran's 1964 paper, Roberts
writes ``It is from this paper that the rumor was started that the
Internet was created by the military to withstand nuclear war. This
is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Roberts said, ``Paul has somehow wound up as
being the inventor of packet-switching, and that's sort of
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Baran says packet-switching did relate to survivability research
and calls it naive to expect the military would have funded the
ARPANET later on if it hadn't offered certain military benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was done on the ARPANET was supposedly done in
the name of connecting civilian computers. There was more to it
that was downplayed for political reasons,'' Baran said. ``Remember
that in the late 1960s, anything that had to do with the military
was anathema to the universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Such debates put off some Bolt, Beranek alumni such as John
McQuillan, who helped design switching programs for digital
signals. Now a Concord-based venture capitalist, McQuillan worries
disputes about the various contributions of the Internet's pioneers
might appear ``unseemly.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous decades, he said, ``the whole point of the research
was getting it right and getting a paper in a peer-reviewed
journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays the Internet is all about making money, getting
funding and patents,'' he said. ``That makes it much more important
whose idea was whose.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's a little hyperbole among friends? Bob Metcalfe, the
inventor of the networking technique known as ``Ethernet,'' helped
run the 1972 conference on the ARPANET but says he's not bothered
by the attention to events of 1969, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now he looks forward to the upcoming celebration in Silicon
Valley. ``There are many occasions to celebrate the birthday'' of
the Internet, Metcalfe said. ``It's any excuse for a party!''

   BOSTON _ Every time you see Pedro Martinez pitch these days,
your admiration for the man and his talents grows greater and
greater. More than Roger Clemens he excels. More than Luis Tiant he
radiates. More than any other star pitcher to come to Fenway Park
over the years, he puts something special on the table. Luckily,
we're all around to drink it in.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the field Tuesday night after another historic
performance, a chant of ``MVP, MVP'' began, as if his 3-0 shutout
and 300th strikeout were the only measures of his greatness. They
weren't, as we found out later. Martinez, pitching like a man
possessed, calmly and efficiently had gone to work knowing that his
favorite aunt, Maria, had died. He got the news just 15 minutes
before game time. There was little emotion as he went the distance
for his 22d victory of the season. But there was plenty of it
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do what she'd want me to do,'' he would say.
``Which is to do well. That's what I tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to put it in the back of your mind the best you can.
Yes, we were close, very close. I can't tell you how close.''
</P>
<P>
   When the news trickled through the clubhouse after the game,
everybody knew what Martinez meant by that. There were still some
wanting to talk about the Most Valuable Player, which traditionally
goes to an everyday player, such as shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
But Martinez's performance under the greatest kind of pressure a
player can feel won't go without notice.
</P>
<P>
   He is a great pitcher. But only a man with unbelievable courage
could have done what he did. Martinez did his job, which included
addressing a sympathetic media corps that would have left him alone
at the drop of a microphone. He stood his ground and answered all
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred strikeouts,'' he said. ``It wasn't special at
all. I've done it before. It's nice to get 300 strikeouts in the
American League and a record. But our main concern is reaching the
playoffs and doing something about it. I didn't even know that I
broke a record until I looked at the scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   In becoming the second pitcher to record 300 strikeouts in each
league (after Randy Johnson), Martinez was certainly worth the
price of admission. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who saw a young
Randy Johnson in Montreal, gave this technical assessment of
Martinez:
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he dominates is something. He does it with three
pitches. You might see a guy come along with a great
fastball-curveball-slider combination. But just to see three
dominant pitches is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, who saw his share of great pitchers in
Atlanta, added, ``I really don't know if we understand how special
a pitcher we're seeing in 1999 and we really won't until time goes
by. Especially when you look at the ERAs across the board, the home
run totals, and teams scoring what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty special just to have the opportunity to watch this
man pitch every game. I've seen guys win games but not with the
strikeouts. All kinds of different pitches. I've never seen
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez knows things easily could have been worse. He missed
two weeks with a sore shoulder. Had he continued to throw instead
of going on the disabled list in July, it might have led to a
dreary end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistency,'' said Martinez. ``I've been healthy enough
to go out there and pitch well for the team. That's what I've been
doing. I'm focused to go out and pitch well and help this team get
to the playoffs and take them a little bit further than I did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be debate about the MVP. Garciaparra, with a
league-leading .359 batting average, is making his bid. He is
closing in on 200 hits and will have 100 RBIs. A year ago, he
finished second in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not forget Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the writers who choose the MVP are traditionalists and
don't like to pick players who go out there only every fifth day,''
said Kerrigan. ``But every now and then a pitcher comes along who
deserves their consideration. Pedro is one of those pitchers.''

GENZYME'S GOLDEN GOATS

<P>
   CHARLTON, Mass. _ Eight years ago Genzyme Corp. set about
building a $110 million cathedral-like bio-manufacturing plant in
Boston to make a single drug that sells for $170,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   If Genzyme's executives could have done it all over again,
they'd have skipped the sophisticated bio-reactors, lengthy
stainless steel plumbing, and high-priced architecture, and bought
a farm.
</P>
<P>
   There they might have produced the same drug, called Cerezyme,
at a fraction of the former cost, using some imported New Zealand
goats housed in spotless barns and tended by a 70-person staff,
including veterinarians with a molecular biology lab and a
hospital-style operating room at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Genzyme did just that. Here, on 184 verdant acres, a
Genzyme subsidiary, Genzyme Transgenics Corp., maintains a herd of
1,600 goats whose lactating females are producing in their milk
nearly a dozen other proposed drugs _ developmental therapies that
hold promise for treating diseases including arthritis, malaria,
diabetes, AIDS, and psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only reason why Cerezyme, which is used to treat a
rare spleen disorder, is not being produced here is that when
Genzyme was building its showcase Boston factory it did not fully
understand the scientific potential of goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we realized that we could produce Cerezyme using
goats, we were (already) very far along with building the Allston
plant and using more traditional bio-manufacturing,'' said Suzanne
Groet, vice president of business development for Framingham-based
Genzyme Transgenics, which runs the Charlton farm.
</P>
<P>
   Today the farm is a busy place, nearly five years old and with
capacity for up to 2,000 goats. It focuses on producing proposed
drugs for such major pharmaceutical makers as Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.,
Bristol Myers-Squibb, Centocor Corp., and BASF Corp.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are partnering with Genzyme Transgenics to test
whether some existing and new drugs can be produced less
expensively and with greater manufacturing flexibility, according
to Dr. Sandra Lehrman, president of Genzyme Transgenics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the capital needed to make 100 kilograms per
year of a pharmaceutical the traditional way with bricks, mortar,
bio-reactors, and stainless steel, initial production will cost
between $20 million and $70 million,'' said Lehrman.
</P>
<P>
   ``With transgenic goats, the costs are between $2 million and $5
million to produce the same amount with probably 35 goats, each
producing 5 to 10 grams of the protein per liter of milk. It's a
great business.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the drugs that the goats now produce, antithrombin III,
is currently in pivotal trials in small groups of patients with
heart conditions, in Europe and the United States, to assess its
efficacy in regulating blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to seek US Food and Drug Administration
approval for the drug next year, which would make Genzyme the first
US company to receive such clearance for a human drug produced in
an animal. That would put it ahead of two European companies,
Pharming Group of the Netherlands, which is working with rabbits,
and Pharmaceutial Proteins Ltd., the Scottish company best known
for its cloned sheep Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see cloning as a research effort that could potentially
create efficiencies in production for us,'' said Lehrman. ``Our
focus is producing drugs for chronic diseases, like cancer,
diabetes, and arthritis, that require large amounts of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Genzyme Transgenics said that even before it gains
FDA approval for ATIII's blood-clotting qualities, it hopes to
launch clinical trials for a variant, antiangiogenic antithrombin
III (or aaATIII) with potential for treating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This proposed drug targets a cancerous tumor's blood supply with
the goal of shrinking it and preventing its regrowth. It was
developed at Children's Hospital in Boston in the laboratory led by
cancer researcher Dr. Judah Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   And while similar versions of the drug are being developed using
traditional biotechnology manufacturing practices by EntreMed Inc.,
of Rockville, Md., Genzyme officials privately say they have a
competitive edge because they can produce their version more
quickly and less expensively using goats.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of pharmaceutical factories, Genzyme, more than any
other US drug or biotech company, is devoted to creating a thriving
business in low-cost manufacturing of protein-based pharmaceuticals
using dairy animials.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the goat farm, which is the largest devoted to
pharmaceutical production, Genzyme is also working with the
Pharming Group to produce a drug in the milk of rabbits to treat
Pompe's disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes muscular
degeneration in infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is gaining a higher profile as a viable and
efficient option for production of therapeutic proteins,'' Mary Ann
Gray, a biotechnology analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates, a Wall
Street investment firm, said in a recent report. ``Goats are
attractive for this production process because they breed
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme has 40 goats available for its antithrombin III clinical
trials, but because the goats are so productive, only three will be
needed to make enough of the compound for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   With goats instead of complex bio-reactor equipment, said
Gregory Liposky, vice president of operations at the Genzyme
Transgenics farm, ``We can make large amounts of protein-based
drugs, such as for malaria and arthritis, that are just simply too
expensive to produce any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The company recently purchased an additional 184 acres adjacent
to the current farm for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Liposky's office are photographs of Genzyme
executives, including chief executive Henri Termeer, that mimic the
current American Dairy Association milk mustache ads.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer's bears the tag line: ``We put more in the mustache.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ At the stove, they act like an old married
couple, except they don't finish each other's sentences. Jacques
Pepin asks Julia Child how she wants the tomatoes sliced and
whether she likes Dijon mustard in the dressing. He, the
professional chef and television veteran, defers to her. She, the
most beloved home cook in the nation, encourages him to be
chattier.
</P>
<P>
   In her kitchen, where hundreds of famous people have come
through and dozens of TV shows have been filmed, Child and Pepin
are making salade Nicoise together. It's probably their thousandth.
It's not quite the same salad that will appear on their new 22-part
TV series, ``Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home,'' nor is it exactly
like the one in the companion book, ``Julia and Jacques Cooking at
Home'' (Alfred A. Knopf). This is a new kind of cooking, announces
the French-born Pepin. ``Cuisine d'opportunity,'' he says,
pronouncing the English word ``dop-pear-tune-ee-tay'' so it sounds
convincingly French.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't quite cleaning out the fridge, but there are things
left from other meals. A crew from National Public Radio had been
there that morning, so remnants from their Caesar salad lesson are
on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicoise ingredients seem common enough: lettuce, green
beans, tomatoes, potatoes, eggs, and canned tuna. Some come from
the supermarket (``Stah Mahket,'' says Child, in the breathy voice
so familiar it makes you smile). And none requires complicated
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But a little magic takes place when Child and Pepin go at this
food. All sense of ordinariness disappears. She plops and plunks
and whooshes, all the while regaling the visitor with stories and
opinions. He's fascinating to watch just chopping an onion, or
flipping a skilletful of mushrooms so high in the air that it
reminds you that the French word ``saute'' means ``jump.''
</P>
<P>
   This is four-handed cooking that ends with all 20 fingers on the
platter.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicoise will get the outer leaves of romaine _ the hearts
went into NPR's Caesar. ``I'm probably one of the few people still
alive who had Caesar salad with the original Caesar,'' says Child,
who turned 87 in August. She was raised in Pasadena, Calif., and
when she was 9, her parents took her to Tijuana, Mexico, where
restaurateur Caesar Cardini made his salads tableside. ``Tijuana
was a cheapy, tumbledown border town,'' she says. ``They had one
nice hotel. The rest of it was cheapo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go there,'' Pepin interjects, ``for a divorce'' _ he says
dee-vorce _ ``and a Caesar salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Caesar, says Child, ``people didn't eat salad. It was for
sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   The banter between the two is easy, built from a friendship that
goes back some 40 years. When they met, Pepin was new to this
country and Child was fairly new to cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Born to restaurateurs in Bourg-en-Bresse, near Lyon, Pepin had
been cooking professionally since his 13th birthday. As a very
young man, he was chef to French President Charles de Gaulle. When
Pepin came to New York, he met the late Helen McCully, then editor
of House Beautiful. ``She was Jacques's American mother,'' says
Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very influential,'' agrees Pepin. ``She was feisty and
a wonderful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of Pepin and Child's friendship, whenever he
and his wife, Gloria, came to Boston, he would stop by to see Child
and her late husband, Paul. They'd all have dinner together in the
famous kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Pepin comes, he cooks. He's standing next to the old
Garland stove, chopping garlic for the wild mushrooms he picked the
day before. He's brought only some of the 15 pounds he collected
near his home in Connecticut, but the haul includes some prized
chicken-of-the-woods. These will accompany the Nicoise because,
during mushroom season, Pepin has been known to show up anywhere
there's a stove and start cooking his wild finds.
</P>
<P>
   Child goes to the refrigerator and finds green beans, all topped
and tailed and ready for blanching. ``I'll put them in the same pot
as the potatoes,'' says Pepin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do separate ones,'' suggests Child. ``I'll get some hot water
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The eggs, already hard-cooked, wait in a bowl of cold water.
Pepin has also brought bouquets of fresh greens and herbs _
purslane, sorrel, basil, tarragon _ which he adds to the romaine.
Child doesn't peel the tomatoes, although she might have in earlier
years, so there is only the simple task of cutting them into
quarters. She has Lazio tuna fish in olive oil, which she orders
from a company on the West Coast. ``There are only 3 more grams of
fat in oil than there is in water-packed tuna. People are so afraid
of fat. This fear of fat has ruined the tuna industry and ruined
the beef industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Child's Nicoise is the traditional salad served all over
Provence, dressed with lemon juice and olive oil. She remembers
ordering Nicoise as soon as she landed at the Nice airport (when it
had a good restaurant), en route to the Childs' house in the south
of France. Pepin likes to add fresh tuna to his Nicoise, and he
makes his vinaigrette in a jar.
</P>
<P>
   They're producing variations on a theme, as they have done since
their collaboration began, while Pepin was teaching classes at
Boston University's Seminars in the Culinary Arts and its cooking
certificate programs. Child joined him, and eventually they taped
``Cooking in Concert'' before a live audience. The response, by all
accounts, was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin liked the idea of turning it into a series. He called KQED
in San Francisco, the public television station where he had filmed
``Jacques Pepin's Cooking Techniques'' and ``Today's Gourmet With
Jacques Pepin.''
</P>
<P>
   The station told Pepin it didn't know if it had the money. So he
went to Geoffrey Drummond, whose A La Carte Communications has
filmed _ in Child's kitchen _ ``In Julia's Kitchen With Master
Chefs,'' then ``Baking with Julia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepin and Child heap praise on Drummond, who agreed to let them
do a series that was largely improvised. That meant holding
discussions before taping, of course, and having a backup kitchen
of cooks ready to produce anything. ``The way we did it was a bit
different,'' says Pepin. ``We didn't want to do a book that said,
`He said, she said.' We just cooked together. It's not
confrontational. It's just bantering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We filmed two a day for a couple of weeks,'' says Child. ``It
was no sweat, very informal. We didn't do any recipes ahead. They
brought all the standard stuff. It was more difficult for the
cameraman and producer. They were a bit lost. But it turned out to
be more the way it is really done in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   He cooked. She cooked. They chatted, got silly sometimes, and
improvised on French culinary traditions. ``It was cuisine
spontanee,'' says Pepin.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way they like it. Decide as they work. ``Shall we put
it on a platter?'' Child asks Pepin. ``I think it's nicer than in a
bowl. I hate having it nicely arranged and then tossed and
ruined.'' She pulls out a large round platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many beans,'' says Child, ``but enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomatoes in wedges, Julia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I like wedges. I don't bother to peel them. I have a
lemon here _ I did have a lemon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used it in the Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the other half. Do we have enough elements?''
</P>
<P>
   Pepin surveys the counter. ``Yes, beans, potatoes, eggs. We have
the tuna. Do you want some mustard in the dressing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little dressing here. See how you like this.''
</P>
<P>
   She holds the dressing so he can dip his finger into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good. We have olives, we have dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more lemon if we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   He puts the dressed greens in the middle of the platter. She
halves the eggs and places them at the edges. With his hands, Pepin
picks up the whole round of tuna and breaks it apart into large
chunks. Child has found a can of anchovies (from the Caesar).
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason people don't like anchovies is that they have an
old can in the refrigerator,'' she says. Pepin breaks up the
anchovies with his fingers and scatters them around the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Child uses her hands to add the tomatoes to the platter, then he
adds the sliced potatoes in two mounds at the edges. Green beans go
between the tomatoes.

   2 tablespoons freshly grated imported Parmigiano- Reggiano
cheese
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Separate the leaves and wash them carefully to keep them whole.
Roll them loosely in clean towels and keep refrigerated until
serving time.
</P>
<P>
   To flavor the croutons, crush the garlic clove with the flat of
a chef's knife, sprinkle on 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and mince well.
Pour about 1 tablespoon of olive oil on the garlic and mash again
with the knife, rubbing and pressing to make a soft puree.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the puree into the frying pan, add another tablespoon of
oil, and warm over low-medium heat. Add the croutons and toss for 1
or 2 minutes to infuse them with the garlic oil, then remove from
the heat.
</P>
<P>
   To coddle the egg, bring a small saucepan of water to a simmer.
Pierce the large end of the egg with a pushpin to prevent cracking,
then simmer it for exactly 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Have all ready the dressing ingredients and a salad fork and
spoon for tossing.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the romaine leaves and
toss to coat, lifting the leaves from the bottom and turning them
toward you, so they tumble over like a wave. Sprinkle with a
generous pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper, toss once or
twice, then add the lemon juice and several drops of
Worcestershire, and toss again. Taste for seasoning and add more,
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Crack the egg and drop it right on the romaine leaves, then toss
to break it up and coat the leaves. Sprinkle on the cheese, toss
briefly, then add the croutons (and garlicky bits in the pan, if
you wish) and toss for the last time, just to mix them into the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 6 or more leaves in a single layer on individual plates,
scatter the croutons all around, and serve.
</P>

Similarly, arrange the olives and the tomatoes each in 2 piles, on
either side of the onion mound, creating a symmetrical design. In a
bowl, toss the green beans with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to
coat evenly, then arrange them in the remaining opposite spaces of
the platter. Nestle each of the 8 egg halves in between the
vegetables, or arrange them around the outside of the platter,
spaced equally. Top each egg half with a teaspoon of mayonnaise,
drape an anchovy fillet over the mayo, and drizzle the anchovy oil
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Invert the open can of tuna directly over the onions, and shake
to release the fish (with all of its oil) in a round in the center
of the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, drizzle 1/3 cup or more of the dressing over the entire
salad. Stand a large spray of basil leaves in the center of the
tuna and serve.

<P>
   Serves 4.

<P>
   1/2 cup cooked waxy potatoes, such as fingerlings or small red
or white new potatoes, in 1/2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons small black Nicoise olives
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion

   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Large handful of mesclun or other tender salad greens
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut the raw tuna into 1/3-inch-thick slices (about 4 or 5) and
sprinkle with half the salt. Coat the bottom of a frying pan with 1
or 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and set over high heat. When
sizzling, quickly lay all the tuna pieces flat in the pan and cook
for about 20 seconds, until just opaque on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Flip the slices over, cook another 10 seconds, then remove the
pan from the heat, allowing the tuna to finish cooking while you
assemble the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Place the scallions, potato chunks, olives, onion, basil leaves,
and the tomato and egg wedges in the mixing bowl. Drizzle on about
2 to 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette, season with the rest of the
salt and the black pepper, and toss briefly to coat. Add the
mesclun to the bowl and toss again, gently.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the salad out onto a dinner plate, and arrange the chunky
vegetable and egg pieces _ if they are hidden by the mesclun leaves
_ so they are nicely displayed. Lay the tuna slices on top of the
mound of greens and drizzle the pan juices over the salad. Serve
immediately.

FOR SOME DEMOCRATS, JEFFORDS NOT SO MODERATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLEBURY, Vt. _ Until now, it would have been fair to call
Senator James M. Jeffords a favorite dance partner of the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Republican was the ``nice guy'' to his liberal
counterparts _ a softspoken Ivy Leaguer who talked about helping
families and educating kids. His record was Democrat-friendly, too,
voting for gun control, health care for the disabled, and funding
for the National Endowment for the Arts. When President Clinton was
impeached, Jeffords was the first Republican senator to say he
would vote to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Jeffords has transformed into something
else in the minds of Democrats: a bull's eye. Democratic Party
officials say Jeffords has begun acting like a hardline
conservative, first voting in favor of a Republican managed
health-care plan, then, as they see it, caving in on a GOP tax cut
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very carefully created an image for himself up here in
Vermont as someone with a moderate to liberal voting record, and
the Democratic Party and our Democratic candidates are going to go
to great lengths to point out that's not necessarily the case,''
said Mark Michaud, executive director of the Vermont Democratic
Party. Beating Jeffords, he said, ``will be our highest priority in
terms of next year's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes 14 months before Jeffords is up for reelection
_ and is seen as a clear sign Democrats are determinedly plotting
his demise. But with Jeffords' power as chairman of the Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and a voting record that
is nearly identical to some Democrats', the strategy may have its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats will try to sell Jeffords as a conservative,
he has generally been in sync with the state's independent-minded
voters, aides to House and Senate Democrats said. Further, even
some Democrats concede Jeffords' defeat could reduce the party's
influence in the labor committee, by removing a mostly-reliable
ally.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bernard Sanders, Vermont's only House member, has
not said whether he will run. But he is seriously considering it.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs, he would have the backing of the Democratic Party,
and if he wins, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, Robert Torricelli, has promised that Sanders would have
an equal shot at committee assignments, even though he is a
registered Independent. Other opponents are lining up as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Jeffords has taken some positions and votes in leadership
roles that are terrifically bad politics in Vermont,'' said Jim
Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``He is, of course, naturally much less conservative
than most of them, but that's part of the deal when you're a
committee chairman. And nowhere was that evident than during the
HMO debate.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, that debate resulted in the passage of a
GOP-sponsored bill that covers only the 48 million Americans who
belong to health-care plans exempt from state regulation. Senate
Democrats _ all of whom voted to reject the GOP bill _ lambasted it
as weak, because it excludes 113 million people. President Clinton
promised to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who could pose the most serious threat to Jeffords,
opposes the Republican HMO plan. Another potential challenger,
Democratic Vermont state Senator Jan Backus, pounced on the vote:
``We're disappointed that at the federal level they don't seem able
to do patient protections we've already done,'' Backus said,
referring to Vermont laws that guarantee a woman's right to make
her obstetrician/gynecologist her primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, however, stands by his vote in favor of the bill. The
Republican version is less expensive, according to the
Congressional Budget Office, which predicted a 6.1 percent rise in
insurance premiums if the Democratic plan were passed. Jeffords
said that could have led to the cancellation of some people's
health care plans altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Said his state director, Jolinda H. LaClair: ``I don't know that
the Democratic bill would have taken care of patients in the way
they need.'' What Jeffords did, she said, was ``try to look at
things that were realistic, that did not threaten patient care or
the quality of our drug supply.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether voters will see Jeffords' final vote as
irresponsible or see his ability to help establish any patient
protection in a Republican-controlled Senate as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   His vote to approve the $792 billion GOP tax cut package could
cut both ways, too. Although he finally voted in favor of the bill,
which Sanders attacked as ``the most irresponsible legislation . .
. in years,'' Jeffords also worked for compromises during the
debate, ensuring, for example, that certain low-income workers
would have their marriage penalty tax eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffords' opponents may be hard-pressed to persuade voters
to judge the senator on a particular vote. He has defined himself
as having power in Washington; if Jeffords is part of a
conservative leadership in the Senate, allies said, he is one who
has brought federal dollars to the state in the form of grants for
education, transportation projects, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to a day-care center here this month, Jeffords
proudly announced a $409,810 Department of Education grant to the
Family Resource Partnership Project. Then he settled in to hear
employees' worries. No one seemed concerned about Jeffords' recent
votes; several were eager to talk about what they perceived as his
record overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't view Jim as either a Democrat or a Republican. We
view Jim as a child advocate,'' said Kathi J. Apgar, president of
the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children. ``I
think it would be only misinformed people that would vote to
replace Jim's position of leadership in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   That is clearly the defense Jeffords hopes to use. ``For a small
state that has very little power outside of seniority, we are in
the best position to help Vermont right now,'' he said, referring
to his alliance with the senior Vermont senator, Democrat Patrick
J. Leahy. ``Voters are very aware that I vote independently. They
watch me closely, and they know I'm not tied down by any political
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders could prove to be a formidable opponent. Because Vermont
has one House seat, Sanders is a familiar name statewide. He is
also a beloved character _ a socialist who would offer a distinct
alternative to Jeffords. In a Democratic poll this March, Sanders
led Jeffords, 45 percent to 40 percent. Recently, he has made
headlines by attacking an IBM plan to change its pension plan in a
way that could adversely affect seniors _ embarrassing Jeffords by
being the first to tackle the issue in Vermont, where IBM is the
biggest employer.
</P>
<P>
   Even LaClair admits Sanders would create a ``tough race.'' But
the specter of a challenge has its advantages for Jeffords: he
already has more than $650,000 on hand, and fund-raising would be
greatly helped if donors felt he faced a real threat.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Jeffords has been an unpredictable ally to
Democrats. He voted against a minimum-wage increase in 1998. He
supported bills opposed by labor unions that let employers handle
workplace disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Senate Democrats who could lose the most if Jeffords
departs, some Democratic aides said. He is still among the most
independent legislators in the GOP, and would likely be replaced by
a more conservative senator as Labor committee chairman if he lost
and Republicans maintained control.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he supported Clinton policies in 69 percent of his
votes. He is also one of a dwindling number of Northeast moderates
whom Democrats can rely on to help cobble a majority; another
moderate Republican senator, John Chafee of Rhode Island, is
retiring, which means that number could shrink further still.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords is likely to use that argument in his campaign. And
Bill Mayers, an administrator at the Parent-Child Center in
Middlebury, said that if Sanders runs, ``a lot of people will be
torn.'' At the same time, he said Vermont ``has this image of being
rural and provincial, and in one sense, that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being farmers, you don't look at what's happening this day.
You look at what's happening this season,'' he said. ``You look at
the big picture. And I think that's what will happen with
Jeffords.''

`WEST WING' CLEANS UP THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WEST WING 
Starring: Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe, Moira Kelly, John Spencer,
Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford 
On: NBC, Wednesday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The networks may indeed be infusing prime time with sex and
violence, as Steve Allen and his right brigade have complained. But
``The West Wing,'' NBC's slick new drama about the Oval Office, is
``Little House on the Prairie'' next to the ``Animal House'' of
recent White House news.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a smart, exhilarating, well-written hour that, if
anything, is a little naive about the folks who run our nation's
most important office. The men and women behind Martin Sheen's
liberal president seem to be loyal, principled employees whose
worst flaws may be workaholism and over-enthusiasm. Despite the
country's disillusionment with politics, ``The West Wing'' takes a
sweetly patriotic view of American government, especially when
Sheen shows up to spout his folksy, avuncular wisdom. His scenes
are almost Capraesque. Of course, that doesn't mean the show won't
attract protest, and advertiser dismay, beginning with a slight of
the religious right. ``The West Wing'' is definitely not ``The
Right Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   This ultimate workplace drama is the latest baby from Aaron
Sorkin, the writer who became a TV phenomenon last season with the
half-hour ``Sports Night.'' It's simlarly peopled with high-strung
employees hooked on verbal volleys, but the White House characters
are less painfully earnest and robot-sounding than those on
``Sports Night.'' They include John Spencer's brusque chief of
staff, Brad Whitford's fiery deputy chief of staff, Richard
Schiff's cynical communications director, and Allison Janney's
press secretary, who slyly encourages the press to ``by all means
enjoy yourselves'' as they buzz around big news of the president's
sprained ankle. With some shrewd development, they could evolve
into a dynamic ``ER''-like ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Lowe is a standout as the deputy communications director, a
pretty boy who sleeps with a woman he later learns is a high-priced
hooker. Whoops. Lowe couldn't have asked for a better vehicle, and
there is amusing subtext to be found in his performance when you
recall the former Brat Packer's videotaped dalliance at the 1988
Democratic Convention. Woops. The fiesty Moira Kelly also shines as
a political consultant to a senator who is planning to run against
Sheen's President Josiah Bartlet.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin's emphasis in ``The West Wing,'' at least based on the
premiere, is on the staffers' lives and not on the political
situations that face the administration. True to the tenor of our
time, the show doesn't ask viewers to keep up with complex and
newsy plot turns, other than a few references to Cuban refugees and
abortion. The goal is to make the White House resemble other
white-collar workplaces, with their complicated power structures
and stress issues. Except, of course, that the eyes of the world
are trained on this particular office, a fact that is bound to
haunt Lowe's Sam Seaborn as the season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere is just about as polished as TV gets these days.
Watch the way the episode races along, a wonder of smooth camera
glides and careful choreography, trademarks of the show's two other
executive producers, John Wells of ``ER'' and Thomas Schlamme, the
noted TV director of shows like ``The Practice'' and ``Sports
Night.'' The characters are constantly in motion, usually striding
down hallways, and the camera is always with them, unless it stops
for a moment to catch a small ancillary moment. While this
technique feels claustrophobic on ``Sports Night,'' it enlivens
``The West Wing,'' which features an expansive White House set.
It's a reproduction, and it looks almost better than real.

 BROOKLINE, Mass.: ... of life.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was with such diligence that he attacked golf, and only after
he became a fair player, getting his handicap down to 9 (out of a
maximum of 18), did he join Verulam, the course designed in 1905 by
former British Open champion James Braid.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, Ryder's influence was instantly felt. Verulam was a
parkland course, designed to accommodate limited space, and it
originally consisted of nine holes with a tin shed for a clubhouse
built on land reluctantly leased to the town by the Earl of
Verulam. In 1909, soon after Ryder joined the club, the earl
suddenly had a change of heart, insisting that he would extend the
lease at affordable terms only if the course were expanded to 18
holes, with nine more on the other side of Cottonmill Lane. Ryder's
handiwork was detected in the earl's surprise support, and in 1911,
he was elected captain of Verulam for the first of three terms.
During that time, he oversaw the construction of the rambling
Edwardian clubhouse that replaced the shack.
</P>
<P>
   His epiphany concerning the plight of the touring pro did not
come until years later.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1920s, the Ryder family would spend summer
vacations in the southeastern seaside retreat of Weymouth in Dorset
County. Automobiles were alien at the time; most families on
holiday would travel by train. But the Ryders would debark from a
magnificent Bentley of which they were all vigorously, and
justifiably, proud. For Sam, these getaways included golfing
pilgrimages to the Weymouth course Came Down, staffed by the noted
pros Charles, Ernest, and Reginald Whitcombe.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder was not above frivolity, such as wearing a ridiculous
wooly pink hat during occasional rounds. Helen, never accused of
having a sense of humor, would berate him when he wore it at
Verulam, and he would respond, ``Don't worry, everybody here knows
me.'' When he'd don the hat at Came Down and receive a similar
rebuke from his wife, he would say, ``Don't worry, nobody here
knows me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitcombe brothers came to know him, and befriend him. Their
conversations included tales of woe about their livelihood. They
were at the members' beck and call, they lamented, and had to
arrange their tournament schedules accordingly. British pros were
not paid for their time away from the course. Tournaments always
were scheduled to end on Fridays so the competitors could be back
at their clubs to serve the membership on weekends. And they were
paid a pittance compared to their American counterparts,
particularly the likes of Hagen, whose grandeur was as impressive
as his game.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder regarded all this sympathetically, but true to his nature,
he paid it more than lip service. Rather than simply condemning the
working conditions, he set about trying to improve them. He began
underwriting challenge matches at Verulam and neighboring clubs _
most notably the Heath and Heather Tournament July 10, 1923. Events
such as this attracted the cream of British golf: former Open
champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray and J.H. Taylor and Duncan and
Braid, plus the shy, self-effacing Mitchell, whose lamentable
epitaph was that he was the greatest British golfer never to win
the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Prize money could reach as much as 450 pounds, and more than
competition, the intent was to supplement the pros' meager wages.
It was after one of these matches in late 1925 that Ryder
stunningly announced he had hired Mitchell, then the professional
at North Foreland, as his private pro. Perhaps Ryder was charmed by
Mitchell's personality or the fact that, like himself, Mitchell
once had been a gardener. Whatever the reason, the princely annual
salary of 500 pounds plus 250 pounds expenses freed Mitchell to
pursue tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   That was the idea behind the hiring, but Ryder felt he could do
more on a larger level.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was at Wentworth, accompanied by Joan and surrounded
by the most elite professionals on both sides of the ocean, plus a
crowd estimated at 2,000-3,000. The imperial Hagen had declared
himself US captain, and his lineup included Tommy Armour, defending
Open champion Jim Barnes, Cyril Walker, Al Watrous, Bill Mehlhorn,
Joe Kirkwood, Emmet French, Fred McLeod, and Joe Stein. The
Britons, led by nonplaying captain Taylor, featured Duncan,
Mitchell, Ray, Arthur Havers, Ernest Whitcombe, Aubrey Boomer,
Archie Compston, George Gadd, Herbert Jolly, and Fred Robson.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder followed them as they set out on Colt's tight 6,315-yard
creation, highlighted by his signature 11th hole, a 462-yard, par-4
dogleg right that required a fade over a mountain of heather, then
a draw to the green. Bordered by stately, ancient houses on prime
Surrey real estate, the course, baked by the sun and sprouting
heath and heather in devilish places, posed a test to the British,
a hopeless mystery to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession, the Americans had agreed that the first day
would consist of foursomes, a format they rarely played but the
English relished. They also dominated, winning all five 36-hole
contests. Ryder delightedly watched the beloved Mitchell and Duncan
rout Hagen and Barnes, 9 and 8, in the day's main event.
</P>
<P>
   In the singles the following day, it was more of the same. The
lone American winner was Mehlhorn, who beat Compston on the 36th
hole. Whitcombe and French halved their match; otherwise, it was
all England. Ryder was positively giddy as Mitchell whipped Barnes,
8 and 7, and Duncan destroyed Hagen, 6 and 5, capping the hosts' 13
1/2-1 1/2 landslide.
</P>
<P>
   But establishing superiority hadn't been the point. Fostering
international goodwill had been. And while he was out of earshot,
Ryder would have been heartened to hear Hagen say in the wake of
the whipping, ``The spirit is so pleasant. Let's do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, Hagen, and Armour discussed the matter further and
decided, ``We've really enjoyed this. Let's talk to Mr. Ryder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryder was unaware of all this as he and the players adjourned to
the small, round tables in the clubhouse lounge, the Burma Bar, for
the postmatch banquet of champagne and chicken sandwiches the
sponsor had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder preferred Johnnie Walker, though he seldom imbibed in
public. But he was feeling magnanimous nonetheless as he proposed a
toast and said, ``We really should do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated next to him, Duncan pounced on the opening. ``You know,
Mr. Ryder,'' he said, ``it would be great if we could do this every
year. You should donate a trophy, and we could play for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What a splendid idea, thought Ryder. And as usual, he acted upon
it. After returning to St. Albans, he commissioned the noted
British jewelers Mappin and Webb to design a gold trophy for 450
pounds. It was to be awarded regularly to the winner of the Ryder
Cup, and it was topped by the lifelike figure of a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Mitchell.

</P>
<P>
   The first official Ryder Cup Matches were held at Worcester
Country Club in 1927, following the drafting of the Ryder Cup Deed.
Before the British team sailed for the US, Helen Ryder presented
the trophy to Gadd, representing the PGA, on the veranda of Verulam
Golf Club. Overwhelmed by the reception they received on the other
side of the Atlantic, the British were trounced, 9-2, at Worcester.
Two years later, the deed of trust was amended to hold the matches
biennially and to mandate that all players must be natives of the
country for which they were participating. One reason the 1926
matches at Wentworth are considered unofficial was that several
members of the US team were not American natives; in fact, some,
such as Barnes, hailed from Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By 1977, the format was altered for a three-day event: five
foursomes on the first day, five four-balls on the second, and 10
singles on the third. In 1979, after years of US domination, the
eligibility was changed to include players from throughout Europe.
Since then, European success _ and Ryder Cup interest _ have
increased exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   The 33d Ryder Cup Matches, now a billion-dollar enterprise, will
be held this weekend at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Verulam Golf Club, which bills itself as ``The Home of the Ryder
Cup,'' never has hosted a Ryder Cup. But it is stuffed with Ryder
memorabilia, including the mayoral portrait that dominates the
Ryder Room and an oil painting of Mitchell that was donated last
fall by Samuel Ryder's only two male heirs, great grandsons Sam and
Tom Ryder-Smith. Sam, who works on Disney cruises, will be at this
year's matches as a guest of the British PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth Golf Club hosted one Ryder Cup _ the 1953 matches,
which the Americans won, 6 1/2-5 1/2. It now features three courses
_ the East, the West, and the Edinburgh. The East no longer is
considered the championship course. The West is, though its first
hole was the original launching point for the East.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Ryder attended two more Ryder Cup Matches _ British
victories at Moortown in 1929 and Southport in 1933. The '33
matches were highlighted by the attendance of the Duke of Windsor,
the future King Edward VIII, who mingled with the crowd of 15,000,
as did a proud Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   Having contracted pneumonia on an annual Christmas vacation to
London, Ryder died on Jan. 2, 1936, and was buried in St. Albans
Cemetery. His estate amounted to 28,000 pounds, a rather modest
tally for a man of such obvious wealth. Before his death, he
explained why: ``I have given most of my money to religion and golf
during my lifetime, for I thought it would do rather more good than
after my death.''

THREE ATTRACTIONS FROM SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Sergio Garcia is electric, spontaneous,
theatrical, passionate, vibrant. That combination has made him the
singular sensation of world golf.
</P>
<P>
   And typical of Spanish golf.
</P>
<P>
   As enthralling an international presence as the 19-year-old has
become since he turned pro five whole months ago, he is merely
perpetuating a tradition in his homeland. True, golf doesn't just
take a back seat to soccer along the Mediterranean, it gets stowed
in the trunk. But in spite of the game's lack of cachet, golf
greatness has become a virtual Spanish cottage industry. That's why
the king and queen are here to whoop it up for three of their
subjects _ Garcia, Jose Maria Olazabal, and Miguel Angel Jimenez _
who form a quarter of the European team that will face the United
States at The Country Club this weekend in the 33d Ryder Cup
Matches.
</P>
<P>
   That's also why the Spanish influence has played a major role in
the competition since the original Great Britain-US format was
expanded to include all of the Continent in 1979. Since then, the
onetime ho-hum American biennial showcase has turned into a true
duel, with Europe capturing the Cup five times, including the last
two.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodlines of achievement course through Garcia. Seve
Ballesteros, the original firebrand, and Olazabal have served as
the mentors of history's youngest Ryder Cupper since his
adolescence. But they have had accomplices in Spain's emergence on
the course. Jose Maria Canizares and Manuel Pinero have made lesser
contributions to Europe's Ryder renaissance, and Jimenez is the
latest supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just seeing all those Spanish players playing in the
Ryder Cup, it's an honor to be here,'' said Garcia. ``It's an honor
to be following in their footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail was blazed by Ballesteros, who played on three Ryder
champions and captained the 1997 victors at Valderrama on his
native soil. He's never been a barrel of laughs, but he is a
competitive furnace, and that has rubbed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Seve has been a big inspiration over the years,'' said
European captain Mark James, a reserved Englishman. ``There's no
question about that. He certainly brought a unique type of passion
to the Matches. He has a certain kind of charisma which has a
magnified effect during the week of the Ryder Cup. And now we have
Sergio Garcia, who has risen through to become _ we regard him as a
young Seve.''
</P>
<P>
   That Seve's game has deteriorated, which is why he's not here.
But Olazabal, the 1999 Masters champion, serves as a reminder of
Ballesteros in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the inception of the European Ryder Cup team, it's been
Seve, hasn't it, that has dominated that,'' said another subdued
son of the Empire, Scotland's Colin Montgomerie. ``And with his
partnership with Olazabal, they're the most successful partnership
in Ryder Cup history.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal doesn't consider that a coincidence. Both he and
Ballesteros have been visceral forces, and he believes it's a
product of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we are, most of us, anyway,'' he said. ``It's
very difficult to see a Spanish person which is very quiet and
doesn't react to certain situations. We are not as calm as some of
the British, that's for sure, or Germans or Swedish. And sometimes
it might play against us, but sometimes it plays in our favor. And
it's just a matter of driving that force in your benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation is Garcia, who has enchanted his
audiences even while bedazzling them. His spectacular success _
which included a third-place finish in the Byron Nelson Classic,
his second US pro tournament, and a victory in the European Tour's
Irish Open less than two months after his debut _ crested in the
PGA Championship at Medinah, Ill., last month. There Garcia
finished second by a stroke to America's designated prodigy, Tiger
Woods, in the standings but overtook him in the popularity polls.
Not only has the kid flourished, but he's looked as if he's having
a grand time doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like that,'' he said. ``I think most of the Spanish
persons are just like that. They are very open persons. They are
very funny. They're always trying to make friends. That's what I
always try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partially what makes him a big deal around the world. And
just one of the guys at home.

1975 _ BARNES GOES BEAR-HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is an exaggeration to say that Brian
Barnes is bigger than life. There have been times in his golfing
career, however, when this massive man with the Popeye arms has at
least been able to look life eye-to-eye. Like the time when he
played his final round early and headed straight to the bar, at
about the same time the wind started howling and the rain started
pouring and the scores started soaring. Next thing anyone knew,
Barnes was tied for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   They retrieved him from the bar for the playoff, which he won,
of course. It may have been the time he marked his ball with a beer
can _ or that could have been another tournament. Doesn't much
matter, because there is always another tale to tell when the topic
is Brian Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   He was a drinker, wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus handicap,'' said Barnes, a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also a tough competitor and at the 1975 Ryder Cup at
Laurel Valley Golf Club in Ligonier, Penn., Barnes stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   That competition was pretty much going the way they always did
in those days _ that is, an American rout. It was 4-0 after the
opening foursomes and through two days it was 12 1/2-3 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of putting the spectators to sleep _ if they even had
decided to stay _ US captain Arnold Palmer had to do something. ``I
have been told that it's a fact,'' said Barnes, ``that Arnie had
gone to Bernard Hunt, who was our captain, and asked him
specifically who he thought might give Jack (Nicklaus) a bit of a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to have somebody who might possibly have the chance
of bringing him down a peg or two. And Bernard said, `The only guy
I have who hits the ball as far as Jack does, and is not a bad
match player, is Barnesy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he had played with Nicklaus before and though ``he
was my hero, always has been,'' the big Englishman was certainly
not in awe. His play showed it as Barnes, smoking his pipe all the
way, won, 4 and 2, in the morning singles competition.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Nicklaus's turn to orchestrate things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack went to Arnold,'' said Barnes, ``and basically said, `To
keep the interest going and the spectators going, you've gotta give
me an opportunity to get my own back with Barnesy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was just a month after Nicklaus had won his fourth PGA
Championship, just five months removed from his fifth Masters
title. In other words, he was in his prime _ and his competitive
juices were now flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus started birdie-birdie. ``But as luck would have it,''
said Barnes, ``he didn't continue on that vein and whatever
happened, I beat him. Made a birdie from 10 feet on the 17th to
win, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   The US trounced Great Britain &AMP; Ireland, 21-11, At the closing
ceremonies, Palmer praised his team, but couldn't resist a playful
jab at Nicklaus. ``Even Jack, who lost twice today. But he doesn't
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Nicklaus, his ears burning at such a comment, snapped:
``Yes I do.''

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The joke around the clubhouse is that there's
a ``no bow tie'' rule this week. And that goes for Ascots, too.
After all, isn't neckwear what comes to mind when one imagines the
primrose playground on Clyde Street? Bow ties and Brahmins and blue
blood?
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club has been around for so long now (117 years)
that fable has overtaken fact. The name itself evokes a
19th-century aura of Cabots and Lodges and Saltonstalls, of
plus-fours and mashie niblicks, of gin and tonics and watercress
sandwiches _ and insularity.
</P>
<P>
   Most stories written about the club during the past century draw
upon a list of adjectives ranging from stuffy to snooty. Not so,
its members insist. ``We're all humans here,'' testifies club
president Gerry Church. ``We get up in the  &UR; morning  &LR; and go to bed
at night. We're just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club's 1,300 well-to-do members may not be quite
like everybody else, but they're more like everybody else than they
were a decade ago. Since the club hosted the 1988 US Open, women
have been allowed to become voting members, blacks have been
admitted, and the number of other non-WASPs has been slowly
growing. And TCC has made a point of reaching out beyond its gates
to the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still is an exclusive club, there's no getting around
that,'' says Richard Kelliher, Brookline's town administrator.
``But the leadership of the club has made a genuine attempt to
connect with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the club has allowed the high school's golf teams to
play matches there and has arranged annual outings for local
police, fire fighters, and other town employees. But this week's
Ryder Cup has been the catalyst for an historic partnership between
club and town that will extend into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the $3 million that Brookline will reap from corporate
tents at the public Putterham Meadows course, plus free tickets to
practice and competition rounds, the club is putting up a
six-figure donation to endow a youth foundation and will host an
annual public tournament to keep the money flowing. TCC will also
donate a statue of golfing legend (and townsman) Francis Ouimet to
the town, provide Thanksgiving dinner for elderly Brookline
residents, help develop a mentoring program for young people, and
provide meeting space for town organizations during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've opened up a new era of good feeling,'' says John
Cornish, a longtime member who chairs the club's Ryder Cup
committee. ``I've always thought we had a good relationship with
the town, although some people felt otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the club's unprecedented linkage with the town, some
local critics have felt that TCC should broaden its WASPish
membership rolls to reflect Brookline's diversity. But The Country
Club is not the YMCA, defenders point out. It is a private
institution that pays taxes and has the right to choose its own
members. ``A club is a club is a club,'' says Kelliher.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other country clubs when TCC was founded in 1882.
J. Murray Forbes, a China trade merchant who lived in a
Commonwealth Avenue townhouse, wanted a suburban retreat where
cold-roast Boston families could dine, bowl, play lawn tennis, and
race horses. Golf, considered a nuisance by the horsemen, didn't
come until a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Though TCC was a founding member of the US Golf Association, has
hosted three Opens, and has 27 holes scattered among its 250 acres,
its members have never considered it a golf club. ``I still think
of it as a social club with a great sport facility,'' says Church.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its ``nature-made'' golf layout, which perennially ranks
among the nation's top 50, The Country Club offers tennis courts, a
curling rink, a swimming pool, a skeet range, cross-country skiing
trails, and a skating pond, where Olympic champion Tenley Albright
practiced before the 1956 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Though the primrose-painted clubhouse is expansive and
comfortable, it is hardly ostentatious. That has never been The
Country Club's style. ``This is a very laid-back place,'' says
member Lionel Spiro. ``Look around the parking lot. The automobiles
are not very fancy cars. Most of the people like to lead very
understated lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is prized at TCC. ``Like a lot of clubs, there are
members here who don't crave public attention,'' says Cornish. So
when they're asked about their membership demographics and their
minority membership, club officials shrug. ``Our policy is that
race, color, creed, ethnicity, and sexual preference are not
considered,'' says Cornish. ``So we don't keep statistics like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's a historical fact that no Jews were admitted until
the '70s, no women (as full members) until 1989, and no blacks
until 1994, there are more of all of them now, members say. ``The
club is more diverse than it was,'' says Spiro, who is Jewish,
``and there is a desire to have that continue.''
</P>
<P>
   There are practical barriers, though, to how quickly diversity
will come to The Country Club. There are already 900 active members
and a waiting list that exceeds five years, even for a plentiful
pool of legacies. ``The way it works is, members propose their
friends for membership,'' says Cornish.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, that meant Lodges were proposing Cabots. ``But
our generation and our children's generation have friends that are
more diverse than their grandfathers' were, so the membership is
becoming more diverse,'' says Cornish. ``This wasn't a decision
made on an institutional basis. It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club is evolving, its members say, as American
society is evolving, albeit more slowly. ``Like all private country
clubs, we lag the rest of the world,'' concedes Cornish. ``But I
think the perception of us isn't the complete reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since the rest of the world was invited to
wander among the yellow-hued buildings and dodge the squirrels and
tromp across the greensward at Mr. Forbes's suburban retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a fine place,'' says Church, ``and we're glad to
have the world come in and see what we're about. We've come a long
way since the 1988 Open. We've been getting ourselves ready for the
21st century.''

`THE SIMPSONS' GOING STRONG IN 11TH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They debuted in 1988 in vignettes on ``The Tracey Ullman Show,''
quick, quirky cartoon fillers between comedy sketches. In December
1989, this wildly dysfunctional family sparked a merchandising
frenzy, while reintroducing animation to prime time in a trend that
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, ``The Simpsons'' is the longest-running
situation comedy on television. The television landscape has
changed radically in this time (when ``The Simpsons'' debuted, Fox
was on the air only three nights a week, and the idea of the
network having NFL football was an unthinkable pipe dream), the
sitcom has remained a constant.
</P>
<P>
   Homer is still a dunderhead. Marge still has that blue beehive
that would scrape the top of train underpasses. Maggie is still
sucking on a pacifier. Bart is forever stuck in the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Simpsons'' is still fresh and smartly written, and
foreseeably in three years will challenge the record of ``The
Adventures of Ozzie &AMP; Harriet'' as the longest-running sitcom ever,
14 years. Creator Matt Groening said the comedy's durability can be
traced not only to the characters being well-drawn, but the fact
they are drawn in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough to pull off that kind of longevity in
live-action,'' Groening said. ``In animation, at least the
characters don't grow old. Animation lends itself to novelty and
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the brilliance of ``The Simpsons,'' whose 11th season
premieres Sunday on Fox at 8 p.m. Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   While the characters have been locked into their age and place,
the exemplary staff of writers (which once included late-night host
Conan O'Brien) has artfully taken the show in peculiarly different
directions that just wouldn't work in live-action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge advantage. There are just so many areas that we
can delve into,'' said writer George Meyer, who has been with the
show for nine years. ``Cost is never a factor. If we want them to
go to the Great Wall of China for a quick joke, we can do it and it
won't cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the network doesn't give us notes is enormously
liberating,'' Meyer continued. ``We don't have to appease them. We
get to get some really bizarre stories past the American network.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in Sunday's episode, when Homer becomes a consultant to Mel
Gibson (who continues the legacy of the show's high-profile guest
appearances) on his latest film. In the Oct. 3 installment, Bart is
put on a new behavioral drug with some pretty wild side effects.
(Let's just say that Fleetwood Mac was made for singing while
driving a tank, and leave it at that.)
</P>
<P>
   At the onset of the series, the unequivocal star of the show was
Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), whose catch phrases ``Don't have
a cow, man'' and ``Ay, caramba!'' and ``Underachiever and proud of
it'' became T-shirt staples that ended up banned from many schools.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years passed, Homer (Dan Castellaneta) became more
than a foil to his rowdy son, emerging as the lead character of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homer has turned out to be an extremely complicated
character,'' Groening said. ``I keep thinking I have a handle on
what it is that makes Homer tick. And he continues to surprise me
every episode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of his charm is, he is one of the few people on
Earth who really loves what he loves,'' Groening continued. ``He
may be a stupid jerk most of the time, but you have to admire the
fact that when he is holding that greasy doughnut in his hand,
there is nothing more important to him in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said even within the strange world of animation, which
allows a lot more latitude in content than live-action (see ``South
Park''), certain characters can get away with more than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to feature Homer a little bit more because he is
such a loose cannon,'' Meyer said. ``If a kid did (what Homer did),
people would be a lot more alarmed. Homer gets away with murder,
almost literally.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long can ``The Simpsons'' go on without repeating itself
too much? Five years ago I would have said one or two more years,
tops. Now, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``For now we are still having fun, but we are reaching a little
bit,'' Meyer said. ``Like when the Simpsons are finding the Loch
Ness Monster or something like that, you know we are scouring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a time when we can't think of anything new,''
Meyer continued. ``Then we will probably do two or three more
seasons.''

NICKLAUS WAS A EUROPEAN AMBASSADOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ For all his accomplishments as the game's
greatest player, Jack Nicklaus is sometimes overlooked as perhaps
the golf's ultimate sportsman.
</P>
<P>
   His involvment with the Ryder Cup is an example. In fact, it
could be argued that two acts in which he was directly associated
helped make the Ryder Cup the serious competition that it now is.
</P>
<P>
   The most important one came during the 1977 competition at Royal
Lytham and St. Annes in England. Nicklaus was a Ryder Cup member
for the fifth time (he would play just once more, in 1981) but
something was seriously wrong, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down one night with Lord John Derby, the head of the PGA
of Great Britain. I said, `John, you know that for everyone on the
American team it's a great honor to make the team and it's a great
honor to play in these matches. But, frankly, whenthe matches
start, there isn't much competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Americans would win that year, making it 18 wins and
22 matches. This bothered Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win every year,'' he told Derby. ``And I don't think that's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus's suggestion? Extend the dimensions of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You've got a European Tour that you're part of,and I
think if you included the European players and made it Europe
versus the United States, I think you'd have some really great
matches that would really add to the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Derby took Nicklaus's idea and ran with it. In 1979, the
Americans hosted a European Ryder Cup team that included the
charismatic Seve Ballesteros. That, too, was an American victory,
but it didn't take long for Nicklaus's vision to take hold. The
Europeans broke through in 1985 and the Ryder Cup has never been
the same.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is a different competition than what took place in
1969, which is when Nicklaus made his Cup debut. And what a debut
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of America's best in 1965 and 1967, Nicklaus
had been ineligible for Ryder Cup play because he had yet to be a
member of the PGA of America for five years (which was the rule
back then). His debut was put on hold until the second second set
of matches in the morning when Nicklaus and Dan Sikes earned a 1 up
foursomes victory over Bernard Hunt and Peter Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus lost the next day in a four-ball match with Sikes, then
sat out the afternoon matches. He was beaten, 4 and 3, by Tony
Jacklin in the morning singles of the final day, and that afternoon
drew Jacklin again.
</P>
<P>
   As they played the 18th hole, Nicklaus and Jacklin were all
square, and the match, too, was tied. Nicklaus seemed to have the
edge on the hole, and when he made his 4-footer for par, the
pressure shifted to Jacklin. But only for a moment, because
Nicklaus, knowing the US had secured no worse than a tie (and
consequently had retained the Ryder Cup), bent down and picked up
Jacklin's mark.
</P>
<P>
   He had conceded the putt, much to the anger of his captain, Sam
Snead. Thirty years later, Snead still can't believe Nicklaus did
not force Jacklin to make the putt. ``All the boys were hotter than
hell,'' said Snead.
</P>
<P>
   If they were, they never let on to Nicklaus. Nor did Snead. ``He
never said a word to me,'' said Nicklaus. ``The only time I've ever
heard anything like that was from the media. But Snead never said a
word to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I can't imagine Tony Jacklin ever missing a 2-foot putt
in that situation, nor would I ever give him the opportunity to.''
</P>
<P>
   Two feet? Jacklin howls with laughter. He hears about that putt
all the time and it's amazing how long it sometimes get. But no, he
said, he wouldn't have missed it.

TORRANCE TURNED THE PAGE IN 1985 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was the most unforgettable moment in Sam
Torrance's life, so indelible that it couldn't be vaporized by a
bout of self-inflicted amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drunk for four days solid,'' he recalls, somehow, 14
years after the fact. ``I drank all night Sunday. I drank eight
bottles of champagne for lunch Monday. I went to a friend's house
and drank all night there. I went to Spain. Finally, at 2 a.m.
Wednesday, I decided, `I can't get any more in me. ' ''
</P>
<P>
   The binge was fueled by a cocktail of euphoria, relief,
deliverance, and transformation. And while Torrance extended the
celebration to excess, in truth an entire continent's spirits were
overflowing. Because when Torrance sank a 30-foot birdie putt on
the 18th hole at The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, England, on Sept.
15, 1985, he not only beat Andy North, 1 up, he produced the
climactic point in Europe's 16 1/2-11 1/2 victory over the United
States in the Ryder Cup. Thus ended a 26-year stranglehold of
American superiority in the biennial international team matches _
and thus began an era of true competition that has turned this
former foregone conclusion into the extravaganza that will descend
upon The Country Club in Brookline Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest event in the world now,'' says Nick Faldo, a
member of the trailblazing '85 team. ``Ask someone about the 2001
Ryder Cup and they'll want to talk to you. Ask someone about the
2001 US Open and they'll go, `Huh?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If you asked someone about the Ryder Cups of 1958-83, they'd go,
``How much did the Americans win by?''
</P>
<P>
   The situation grew so embarrassingly hopeless for Great Britain,
the US opponent since Englishman Samuel Ryder inaugurated the
matches in 1927, that the perennial losers' lineup was expanded to
include the Continent in 1979, reflecting both the growing
influence of the European Tour and the ineptitude of the founding
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact: two more American slaughters, in '79 and
'81, reinforcing the notion that the matches would forever be
reduced to a formality, an afterthought on the golf calendar, as
reflected by the 21-3-1 US domination.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1983, the Europeans made a far more significant move than
increasing the eligibility pool. They named Briton Tony Jacklin,
the former British and US Open champion, as nonplaying captain. And
with him came a new concept.
</P>
<P>
   Teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin took note that the Europeans were treated like
second-class citizens and played like second-rate golfers. He
suspected there might be a correlation. ``We'd travel in the back
of the bus,'' he says. ``The Americans would come over on the
Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin got his men reservations on the big plane. He dressed
them all in cashmere jackets, a welcome fashion departure from the
ragtag ensembles of the past. But his most important innovation was
the Team Room. He had been appalled by the fact that in the past,
the European Cuppers had acted like a group of strangers without
allegiance, that after their matches, the players would head off
with their wives to the shopping malls or restaurants, as if their
individual day's work was all that mattered, and never mind the
fate of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was vital that the players spend time together,''
he says. ``They needed a place they could gather, talk, console
each other after a hard day.''
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy all tastes, the menu was catered with a cross section
of cuisines _ ``pasta, meat, fish, you name it,'' says Jacklin _
with a heaping helping of harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all designed to make them feel good about themselves,''
says Jacklin. ``I figured if these things made them feel better,
they'd have nothing else to do but play to their optimum.''
</P>
<P>
   They almost pulled off a coup in the '83 matches at Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., but Lanny Wadkins overtook Jose Maria Canizares on
the final two holes of the deciding singles duel as the Americans
eked out a 14 1/2-13 1/2 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was sort of a steppingstone,'' says Jacklin. ``Only
those of us who were there that last afternoon knew how close it
was. We were convinced we were going to nip through.''
</P>
<P>
   When they got nipped instead, the Europeans were disconsolate in
the immediate aftermath. But Seve Ballesteros, the 26-year-old
Spanish swashbuckler, would have none of it. ``This was a
victory,'' he told his teammates. ``We only lost by a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Technicalities aside, Jacklin noticed on the plane _ the
Concorde _ home that ``it was a confidence builder. We thought, `If
we can come that close over there, we can beat them on our own
turf.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So there was a true sense of possibility when the Continent's
constellation of stars _ Ballesteros, Canizares, Manuel Pinero, and
Jose Rivero from Spain; Bernhard Langer from West Germany; and
Torrance, Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam, Howard Clark, Ken Brown,
and Paul Way of Great Britain _ gathered at The Belfry near
Birmingham the second weekend in September of '85. Still, as they
looked across at the American arsenal _ North, Wadkins, Ray Floyd,
Hal Sutton, Hubert Green, Tom Kite, Mark O'Meara, Calvin Peete,
Craig Stadler, Peter Jacobsen, Curtis Strange, and Fuzzy Zoeller _
they wondered if their self-assurance was misplaced bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American thing was always very strong,'' says Ballesteros.
``It was hard to be very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin set the stage for combat by engaging his counterpart, US
captain Lee Trevino, in some gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner on the eve of the competition, Trevino introduced his
squad as if he were emptying a cash register. ``He's going, `This
guy has won $628,242.18,' and so on,'' says Faldo. ``He winds up
with, `That's a total of $13 million' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin offered a simple rebuttal. ``He said, `I'd like to
introduce my team alphabetically,' '' recalls Faldo. `` `Seve
Ballesteros.' And the crowd went nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   During the opening ceremonies the following day, the chastened
Trevino opted for the humble alphabetical routine. ``Then Tony got
up,'' says Faldo, ``and he says, `Here's so-and-so, winner of 17
tournaments, and Ken Brown, winner of five events . . . ' And we're
going, `What? Ken Brown hasn't won five events.' But Tony got the
crowd going again. It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't look so grand after the first day when the
Americans took a 4 1/2-3 1/2 lead through the foursomes _
traditionally a British stronghold _ and four-ball play.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide began to change the following morning. In the final
four-ball, Stadler needed to sink a putt of less than 2 feet _ ``a
gimme,'' recalls Torrance, spreading his hands barely apart _ on
the 18th hole to give him and Strange a victory over Lyle and
Langer and keep the momentum in red, white, and blue.
</P>
<P>
   He missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the turning point,'' says Torrance. ``It showed us,
`These guys are feeling it like us. Let's get out and do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They did, to the tune of a 5 1/2-2 1/2 second-day tally for a
9-7 lead entering the finale, which consisted of 12 singles
matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans needed only 5 1/2 points to end the misery, but
Jacklin was leaving nothing to chance. ``Tony was brilliant
tactically,'' says Faldo. ``He said, `They're expecting us to save
our strongest players for last. Let's get after them early.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one of his choices was virtually made for him. The
fearless Pinero begged the captain to let him play first, and when
he discovered his opponent would be the European-killer of two
years before, Wadkins, ``he literally leaped 3 feet in the air,''
recalls Jacklin. ``He was over the moon. He said, `I'll put out
Wadkins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, 3 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a surge of five European victories in the first
six matches. Which meant that Torrance-North loomed as the
clincher. And Jacklin made sure his 32-year-old veteran knew it.
The captain had been scrambling all over the course, trying to be
available for the start and finish of each match, but the stakes in
this one required his constant attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and said, `Come on, we only need 1 more
point; you can do it,' '' recalls Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his prospects were looking grim. ``I was three down
after 10,'' says Torrance. ``Then I made three or four birdies
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was still 1 down at the 17th when he stood over a 6-foot
birdie putt that could square the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toughest putt I've ever had to make,'' says Torrance.
``Everything was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   But not his stroke, which proved straight and true and left
things even as he and North arrived at the 18th tee on the
7,176-yard, par-72 Brabazon course.
</P>
<P>
   Torrance boomed his drive, leaving himself a 9-iron to the
green. North skied his drive, leaving himself in the water. The
match _ and the curse _ effectively were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything I could do to control my emotions,'' says
Torrance. ``I had tears in my eyes coming off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   As a schoolboy in Largs, Scotland, Torrance had dreamed of
someday sinking the putt to win the Ryder Cup. Now here it was,
even if it wasn't as dramatic as his fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had three putts from 30 feet to win,'' says
Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   He nailed the first, and unleashed a torrent of exultation among
30,000 fans, the third straight Ryder Cup record attendance in as
many days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Belfry was a good course,'' says Faldo. ``You could hear
the crowds on the other holes. It was nice to hear the cheers and
know they were for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrance in particular. He's won 21 European Tour events, but he
says, ``This was 50 million times greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he a hero?
</P>
<P>
   ``Still am,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His first act in this newfound role was to leap into Jacklin's
arms, and after the final points had been tallied, the winners
repaired to the roof of The Belfry, where they sprayed the crowd
with champagne. Not all of it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys drank in the bar in the Team Room,'' says Jacklin,
who savored the win in private contemplation, sipping a whiskey in
his hotel room. ``They raised a few roofs that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Some raised more than others, as Torrance can attest. And there
were even more reasons for toasts two years later when Jacklin led
the Europeans to a 15-13 decision at Muirfield Village in Dublin,
Ohio, their first win ever on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most satisfying days of my life,'' says
Jacklin. ``There's only one first time, isn't there?''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no sign of a last time anymore. Starting with the
breakthrough at The Belfry, the Europeans have won four of the past
seven Ryders, including the last two. And when they come to
Brookline, needing only a tie to retain the Cup, their assistant
captain will be 46-year-old Sam Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a sobering thought.

GLENEAGLES MATCH IN 1921 SET THE PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENEAGLES, Scotland _ It was the precursor to the precursor.
</P>
<P>
   Five years before British seed merchant Samuel Ryder underwrote
unofficial matches between US and English pros _ and six years
before he donated the cup that bears his name and has become
emblematic of world team golf supremacy _ an informal international
competition was held at Gleneagles, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis, like so many of the specifics concerning the
evolution of the Ryder Cup, is buried in the sand traps of time.
Some sources say the Gleneagles matches were the inspiration of
Sylvanus P. Jermain, the first president of the Inverness Club in
Toledo, Ohio. Others credit the brainstorm to Golf Illustrated
magazine circulation manager James Harnett.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever was the originator, Michael Hobbs reports in his book
``The Ryder Cup: The Illustrated History'' that during a meeting of
the US PGA on Dec. 15, 1920, a motion was passed to fund a trip by
a group of American pros who would receive expenses plus $1,000
each to meet their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Gleneagles, a jewel in the making in the lush
farmland of central Scotland, was obvious. It was the site of the
Glasgow Herald 1,000 Guineas Tournament, the richest in the world
at the time, with a 740-pound purse and 200 pounds to the winner
awarded by the sponsoring newspaper. With top American pros, led by
the flashy Walter Hagen, on hand for the Glasgow tournament and the
British Open two weeks later at St. Andrews, the team event was
considered a natural prelude.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived for the matches, held June 6, 1921, the
Americans found a hotel sprouting from the heather that was not
only palatial but partial. Only three of the four floors had been
completed, and there was no roof, so the players stayed in sleeper
cars at nearby Gleneagles Station, according to Hobbs. The resort
was the brainchild of Donald Mathieson, board chairman of
London-based Caledonian Railways, who wanted to capitalize
commercially on the sporting pursuits _ golfing, hunting, fishing _
that flourished in the Scottish midlands.
</P>
<P>
   While the hotel remained a work in progress, the golf facilities
were another matter. Legendary British player and course architect
James Braid had carved the King's Course from the glacial valley,
building on a surface of sand and gravel, which allowed natural
year-round draining, to create a seeming oxymoron _ an inland links
layout, nine holes going out and nine coming in.
</P>
<P>
   The course, which offered a panoramic view of the surrounding
Ochils Hills, climbed 175 feet from the first to the 12th hole,
then began its descent to the 18th and the rudimentary clubhouse,
the Dormy Shop. Each hole was self-contained in its own
amphitheater, and each boasted a distinct feature. For instance,
the 13th, called ``Braid's Brawest'' (Scottish for ``Best''), was
guarded by two sinister bunkers, ``Auld Nick'' (``Devil'') and
``Young Nick.'' The 14th contained seven bunkers, one for each day
of the week, arranged in diagonal torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``God created the landscape,'' said Braid. ``I was commissioned
to find the golf holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The holes he sculpted were considered British Open-caliber,
though Hobbs writes that the American pros complained about the
disheveled fairways and bunkers, proving that they were no
different than their descendants of today.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, they played five foursomes matches in the morning
and 10 singles in the afternoon under brilliant sunshine amid a
tricky breeze. As would be the case five years later at Wentworth,
England, in Ryder's first clambake, the British romped, 10 1/2-4
1/2. The hosts _ composed of Braid, George Duncan, Abe Mitchell,
Harry Vardon, Ted Ray, J.H. and Josh Taylor, Arthur Havers, James
Ockenden, and James Sherlock _ enjoyed a 3-1 advantage in the
morning matches, winning three and halving two, and went 6 1/2-3
1/2 in the singles against the US contingent: Hagen, Jock
Hutchison, Emmet French, Fred McLeod, Tom Kerrigan, Clarence
Hackney, Wilfrid Reid, George McLean, Charles Hoffner, and Bill
Mehlhorn.
</P>
<P>
   In the headline foursomes, Duncan canned a putt on the 18th that
enabled him and Mitchell to halve their match with Hagen and
Hutchison. The British duos dominated the other matches,
highlighted by Vardon and Ray's 5-and-4 rout of French and
Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan set the tone in the afternoon by edging Hutchison _ one
of three Scottish natives on the American team _ 2 and 1. Hagen
halved his duel with Mitchell, but otherwise, Brittania ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the contestants repaired to the Dormy House for
refreshments and postmortems. Each received a gold commemorative
medal _ later in the week, Mitchell would earn a much grander prize
by capturing the Glasgow Herald tourney _ but there were no calls
for a regular renewal of the event.
</P>
<P>
   International competition was dormant for five years until the
St. Albans seed merchant took over. And that's why the US and
European pros at The Country Club in Brookline this weekend will be
competing for the Ryder Cup, not the Gleneagles Grail.

SUBURBIA: NOT SO BAD, BUT WE HATE IT ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   O suburbia! Are you the home address of the American Dream, or
are you the place where that dream goes to die?
</P>
<P>
   Even after spending most of my life in the suburbs, I'm still
not sure. Neither is P.J. O'Rourke, but being P.J. means never
having to say you're ambivalent. You simply go looking for laughs
in all the politically incorrect places.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke gets himself all cranked up for a good tirade against
suburbia in Rolling Stone, but statistics keep debunking his
arguments and interfering with his grumpy mood, making him even
grumpier. His research reveals that the 'burbs aren't as expensive
as they're cracked up to be, that the alleged hassle of commuting
is largely self-inflicted, that the issue of suburban sprawl is
exaggerated, that suburban kids are better-educated and less
TV-addicted than city kids, and, in his opinion, that designated
punching bag Al Gore's ``livability'' agenda will only screw up
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Rourke hates suburbia on metaphysical grounds, a hatred
expressed in that sui P.J. way. ``How'd we wind up here?'' he
cries, giving voice to a generational lament. ``We were going to
live in Barcelona, Maui, on a mountaintop in Nepal. We were going
to be a novelist, a painter, a Mother Teresa, a Malcolm X, a Jim
Morrison but with more girls, more drugs and a thirtieth birthday.
. . . Oh, how did life turn out so dull?''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Baker, as earnest as O'Rourke is uproarious, also has a
bone to pick with suburbia in the Utne Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Baker builds a case that the trend toward suburban mega-houses _
a ``McMansion mania'' creating ``ostentatious symbols of America's
class divide'' _ has contributed to the erosion of the nation's
supply of affordable housing while also encouraging ``auto-based
sprawl'' and the ``decimation of green space.'' Beyond that, she
argues, the proliferation of these supersized homes is corroding
the very idea of neighborhood and of a shared public space, and
insists: ``The megahouse is a fortress standing guard in a
wasteland.'' Baker and O'Rourke wouldn't likely agree on much, but
they agree on the wasteland part.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One penalty for excessive media hype can be a public backlash of
the sort that sank ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the Kubrick/Cruise/Kidman
opus billed as an erotic thriller that proved to be neither erotic
nor thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to be dissected in Brill's Content, where Katherine
Rosman takes the media to task for allowing themselves to be played
like violins in the movie's skillfully orchestrated publicity
campaign. ``The treatment of `Eyes Wide Shut' marks a low point in
the morphing of journalism into marketing,'' Rosman asserts, then
goes on to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though every TV show and magazine but Time was denied an
advance viewing of the movie or any details about it from the
stars, and thus could not know that they were being manipulated
into hyping a bomb, that didn't stop many programs and publications
from leaping at the chance to showcase Tom and Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the bottom line is the bottom line: With newsstand
sales vital, magazines are desperate to get some sexual sizzle on
their covers, at whatever cost to their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure entertainment and pure sex. Those are the things that
push magazines off the newsstands,'' Rosman quotes Esquire editor
David Granger as saying. ``It's almost a risk to put anything else
on the cover, a commercial risk.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It probably goes without saying that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is not
represented in Entertainment Weekly's list of ``The 100 Greatest
Moments in Movies 1950-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1950 cutoff seems like cheating, and as with all lists there
are choices to quarrel with here (``The Poseidon Adventure''? And
what's with all the Charlton Heston movies?). But in general,
nobody does this sort of thing better than the pop-culture-savvy
folks at EW, who interviewed stars to dig up piquant anecdotes and
details about well-known films.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, for instance, that Meryl Streep was the second choice
for ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' _ behind Kate Jackson of ``Charlie's
Angels.'' Robert DeNiro's famous ``You talkin' to me?'' ad-lib in
``Taxi Driver'' was inspired by a comedian he'd seen in a New York
deli. Marlon Brando had one condition, according to James Caan, for
performing a flashback scene in ``Godfather II'': ``Fire the head
of the studio!'' (They shot the scene without him.). And my
favorite ancedote: At the 1970 Oscars, with counterculture favorite
``Midnight Cowboy'' up against John Wayne's ``True Grit,'' Dennis
Hopper sat directly in front of Wayne during the ceremony wearing a
large Stetson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sneering at Norman Rockwell has long been a favorite parlor game
among art snobs who couldn't forgive Rockwell for creating
illustrations that emphasized our common humanity rather than our
intractable alienation, and that were actually comprehensible by
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   So it is all the more surprising that the Guggenheim Museum, an
outpost of modern art, agreed to host the traveling Rockwell
retrospective. In ARTnews, Edgar Allen Beem talks to critics and
curators and finds a growing respect for Rockwell, even among the
intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-eight percent of the artists he was presumed to be
worse than are unheard of today,'' notes critic Dave Hickey.
``Rockwell is a canonical artist whether museums say so or not.''
New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl adds: ``Rockwell is
terrific. It's become too tedious to pretend he isn't.''

A CONTRARIAN BACKPEDALS ON THOREAU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is as many of you have suspected _ I suffer from a
degenerative mental disease. It is called Incipient Thoreauvianism.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows my Thoreau-bashing credentials are very much in
order. In 1991, I observed the 50th anniversary of the Thoreau
Society with a contrarian assessment of the writer who made the
world safe for Cliff's Notes: ``Concord's most eminent sociopath .
. . a misanthrope, a slob, and a loser . . . a tree-hugging
pyromaniac (Thoreau accidentally set fire to a Concord forest).'' I
suggested Thoreau was a victim of Columnist's Disease: ``He
pontificated endlessly on subjects he knew nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, rock 'n' roll god Don Henley of the Eagles
denounced me for suggesting that his championing of the Walden
Woods cause had more to do with salvaging his career than with
honoring Thoreau. At the time, Henley was shaking down concertgoers
for $97 a seat, purporting to direct some of the proceeds to
``save'' Walden. ``Look at it this way,'' I wrote. ``For $97, you
can feed a village in Rwanda or Don Henley's ego, whichever you
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to switch sides? Thoreau himself says no: ``It is
never too late to give up our prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   The further the world moves away from Thoreau, the more his
message appeals to me. I converted this summer when I spent two
nights on the Presidential Range ridgeline in the Appalachian
Mountain Club huts in New Hampshire. When I arrived atop Mt.
Madison in a driving rain, I asked the crew chief to direct me to
the fireplace so I could dry off. There is no fireplace here, he
replied. No hot water either, and fairly rustic plumbing. No cell
phones. No fax. Just a bunch of happy, smelly people.
</P>
<P>
   Sign me up! I've never joined a church, but I fired off my
membership application to the AMC posthaste. (How can you resist an
organization whose motto is ``Cotton kills''?) I knew I was in the
right club when I started perusing the personal ads in the Club's
Outdoors magazine: ``Daring non-traditional maverick with
traditional edge . . . Fit, dark blonde . . . Author, professor,
successful consultant . . . Advanced scuba diver. Loves independent
films . . . likes metaphor . . . Great legs.''
</P>
<P>
   But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I jotted down a list of directions in which the
world seemed to be headed, and in virtually every instance I seemed
to be going the other way. Statistics have a way of leaving me
behind. I drive more slowly than the norm, infuriating the muscle
cars behind me, and even my own family. Shouldn't I have been
married more times? Shouldn't I have switched jobs more often?
Shouldn't I be receiving more TV channels? How about fewer?
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but be amused by last week's explosion of
``journalism'' touting the new wonder product Visor. In theory,
Visor is the technological equivalent of the Holy Grail, an
``all-in-one'' pocket-size digital gizmo that is a combination
computer/Web surfer/digital music recorder-player/fax
modem/e-mailer and Hot Line to God for all I know. Gotta have it? I
don't think so. Thoreau understood how technologies can come to
rule their creators: ``We do not ride on the railroad,'' he wrote
in ``Walden.'' ``It rides upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Harper's magazine is republishing a 1939
appreciation of Thoreau by E.B. White, who offered this praise to
the steward of Walden Pond: ``As our common complexities increase,
any tale of individual simplicity . . . acquires a new fascination;
as our goods accumulate, but not our well-being, your report of an
existence without material adornment takes on a certain awkward
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Thoreau is hard to love. The million-word Journal is
impenetrable. The travel writings meander here and there; when
Thoreau gets lost, you get lost with him. He may be best remembered
as an aphorist, which is no small thing. And credibility, awkward
or not, is valuable coin.

GARRITY'S DEATH REIGNITES WHITE DENIAL ABOUT SEGREGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with all the facts about white flight, it was not enough to
stem the unforgiving rage hurled last week toward the corpse of
Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. A predictable example from a proven
small mind came from Boston City Council President James Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said of Garrity's order to desegregate the Boston Public
Schools a quarter century ago, ``I don't know if it is possible to
calculate how many lives he destroyed, how many marriages broke up
because husbands and wives didn't have good jobs because of good
education. How many people turned to drugs and alcohol? . . . I
have no reason to be sad that he died.''
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar example came from a man who tried to prove his mindhad grown from his myopic South Boston roots, former mayor Ray
Flynn. Despite his worldly travels as ambassador to the Vatican,
Flynn had this to say about Garrity:
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish that the decision he made about the Boston public
schools didn't disrupt the education of our children and the
stability of our city as it did. In my opinion, public schools in
Boston still haven't recovered from the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity may be dead, but the white denial surrounding his
attempt to engineer educational equality is as blind as ever. In
all the coverage of Garrity's death, nothing was volunteered from
these apologists for a resistance as virulent as that in 1950s
Little Rock as to how African-American children in the Boston of
the 1970s were going to get a quality education.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity ruled that Boston ran a ``dual school system'' that gave
white neighborhood schools far more resources than black schools.
When Flynn said he wished Garrity did not ``disrupt'' the education
of ``our'' children, he meant only white children. The education of
black children was in a permanent state of disruption that
destroyed employment and college opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence to support the notion that school busing by
itself destroyed white families or sparked white flight. Many white
families were running away as fast and as far away as they could
from black folks regardless of busing.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1996 book ``Dismantling Desgregation,'' Harvard
University professor Gary Orfield and co-author Susan Eaton found
that major cities that either had little or no busing or ended
busing by the early 1980s still had massive white flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If white enrollment declines were caused by busing, then
cities with neighborhood schools would have stable enrollments, but
there are very big white enrollment losses there,'' Orfield and
Eaton wrote. They also said busing critics ignore the fact that
all-white suburbs are still being built while residential
segregation has expanded in cities, fueling drops in white urban
enrollment ``no matter what happens in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American students braved the rocks, the sight of
overturned police cars, effigies, slurs, and threats to get on the
buses. But the window where busing might have provided a better
education for African-American students was short lived. By the mid
1980s, Boston was gripped with conditions similar to most large
cities. The suburbs had expanded, the cities and their property tax
bases had shrunk, and the schools _ busing or no busing, Garrity or
no Garrity _ are once again dual systems.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's system is 75 percent African-American and Latino and 16
percent white, but it's most prestigious school, Boston Latin, is
51 percent white and 29 percent African-American and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   While white parents of privilege have destroyed affirmative
action at Latin and in busing in order to hoard scarce resources,
African-American parents fight to jump ahead of each other on the
massive waiting list for the METCO program that allows
African-American children in the Boston Public Schools to attend
suburban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind are low income students, usually of color, in what
Orfield calls the ``resegregation of American schools.'' In a
report released in June, Massachusetts had the seventh-highest rate
of resegregation among the 28 states with substantial
African-American enrollments and the fourth-highest rate of
resegregation among the 12 states with large Latino populations.
</P>
<P>
   Orfield wrote, ``We are floating back toward an educational
pattern that has never in the nation's history produced equal and
successful schools. There is no good evidence it work now.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the problem with the carping over Garrity's
corpse. The Flynns, the Kellys, the Kevin Whites, let alone the
rock throwers, criticized the judge knowing they were not about to
pour resources into black neighborhood schools. That stasis led
naturally to a large scale abandonment of the schools once they
inevitably became mostly black, brown, and of low income.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity did the best he could with the Little Rock he was
handed. Now he watches down from the big bench in the sky, no
longer to be reached by the hate mail and obscene phone calls that
called him a ``Nazi'' and ``nigger lover.'' He waits to see if the
politicians and citizens of today and tomorrow will fight for
resources or set low-income black and brown children adrift in the
new dual system, allowing them to be pulled away from opportunity
by the rip tide of separate and unequal.

   BOSTON _ Now that the Oscars, Grammys, and Emmys have become
televised fashion shows, it only makes sense that high-profile
sporting events would be the next target. During this week's Ryder
Cup festivities, the players' wives and girlfriends are going to be
decked out Hollywood-style in head-to-toe Badgley Mischka.,
starting Wednesday night at a Four Seasons gala ball where Celine
Dion and the Boston Pops are scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods's girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda, is expected to wear a
burgundy beaded velvet bodice and printed silk skirt, while captain
Ben Crenshaw's wife, Julie, is wearing a blue-and-silver
lace-and-beaded sheath dress.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of star treatment is a first for the American team,
which normally doesn't coordinate garb for its social events, and a
real coup for a design duo identified mostly with events like the
Academy Awards. ``Most of our focus is celebrity dressing out of
Hollywood,'' said Mark Badgley, who flew into Boston Tuesday with
his partner, James Mischka, to attend a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion
show and the Ryder Cup ball and opening ceremony. ``But the whole
sports world has become so important. . . This is a great way for
us to introduce ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   European origin
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in fashion, the inspiration for all this drama
began in Europe. Two years ago, during the Ryder Cup in Spain, the
wives and partners of the European team all wore Escada gowns to
the gala ball, which got the Americans thinking. When Escada
offered to provide dresses for the US entourage this time, the
women declined because they wanted to support an American design
house like New York-based Badgley Mischka, which is in partnership
with the Germany-based Escada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled,'' said Julie Crenshaw, who was responsible for
coordinating the Ryder Cup women's wardrobes (including the
partners of the 12 players, herself, the assistant captain's wife,
and the officials' wives and girlfriends _ 21 women in all). ``When
you put on their dresses, you can't help but feel glamorous and
beautiful. . . We feel like princesses, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like princesses, the Ryder women don't have to worry
about paying for the $3,000 to $7,000 gowns. The PGA is footing the
bill for the formal dresses and coordinating handbags, as well as
for matching Badgley Mischka dresses for the opening ceremony and
women's uniforms for the games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tough choice
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To keep the planning simple for the gala event, Badgley and
Mischka flew their entire fall collection of about 150 dresses to
Augusta, Ga., for the Masters tournament in April. There, they
lined up the dress samples _ everything from velvets to lace to
satin to beading _ on racks in a big room and let the women go
nuts. ``It was crazy,'' recalls Crenshaw. ``It was a wonderful
scene. The girls had so much fun. It was overwhelming to have so
many beautiful choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriends and wives of the top 25 US players (the Ryder
Cup team hadn't been chosen yet) were instructed to select three
dresses they loved. Ultimately, the dress they would wear was
determined by how well their men performed on the links. ``It was
based on ranking,'' Crenshaw said. ``Fortunately, we didn't have
any duplicates.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cinderella problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After months of eager anticipation, the Ryder women will
actually wear their gowns for only a few hours. ``The PGA has
promised the players they'll be out by 10 p.m. They want them to
start focusing on the game,'' said Melissa Lehman, wife of Tom
Lehman of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all beautiful and dolled up and then get whisked away
by 10. . . At the last two (Ryder) balls, the one thing I wanted to
do was dance with my husband and there wasn't a lot of that by the
time you get done with the dinner part of it. I would rather do
away with the pomp and circumstance and just party. I'd prefer to
make it like the prom. Who wants to sit in a beautiful gown and eat
dinner? That's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
The morning after &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, at the opening ceremonies, the Ryder women will change
from their glamorous gowns into a more subdued Badgley Mischka
outfit designed specifically for the event: taupe crepe dresses
with three-quarter-length sleeves and satin waist bands and
coordinating full-length brocade jackets. ``We sort of wanted a
Jackie O. look for Boston,'' said Crenshaw. ``They are very
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Ryder women will sport everything from
hunter-green suede pants with yellow argyle mock turtlenecks and
matching cardigans to gray pinstriped skirts, shorts or pants,
blue-and-white striped blouses, and navy blazers. ``It's very New
England _ conservative and traditional,'' said Crenshaw.
``Everything we've done, we tried to keep in tune with New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what does one do with a Badgley Mischka evening gown after
the ball? Lehman has very specific plans. ``I'm hoping to wear it
to a George W. Bush inauguration,'' she said. ``We're part of his
campaign (team) in Phoenix.''

BUSH BALANCES BETWEEN SCRIPT AND IMPROVISATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Texas Governor George W. Bush is burning. He
can't believe what Vice President Al Gore just did, showing up in
Texas to chide the governor for letting children be taught in
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   This, Bush says, is exactly the trouble with Gore. While Bush
braves controversy, calling for federal tax dollars for private
schools, Gore talks about building new schools, doubtless after
consulting with a pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the polls said something about buildings,'' says
Bush, scrunched behind a kitchenette table in the campaign
Winnebago known as Minnie the Winnie. ``I talk about children and
he talks about buildings. Therein lies the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush scans a semicircle of aides, smiling now and clearly
satisfied. There is just one problem: On the very day Bush is
lashing out against Gore for ignoring children, the vice president
has unveiled a plan to provide health insurance for every child in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has no child health plan _ not yet. An aide later says that
advisers are crafting one.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment that says much about the way the Texas governor
is campaigning for president, scripted to the sentence when the
issue is familiar; improvising, sometimes awkwardly, when it is
not.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign stops in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire and
Michigan, plus an unexpected detour to Texas to deal with the Fort
Worth church shooting, Bush emerges as a candidate almost forming
before your eyes, substance racing to catch up to the famous name
and front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   He is a consummate campaigner, tending to the crowds on the
trail like a host at a barbecue, glad-handing every comer, grinning
at flashbulbs of a thousand cameras. He seems bemused by it all,
this cowboy-booted son of a former president, barely known
nationally until this year, and now treated like a political
incarnation of a country-and-western star.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush travels through the key caucus and primary states,
the layers of complexity behind his incandescent smile are slowly
revealed. On the stump, he plays it safe and predictable, rarely
risking a new phrase. But in question-and-answer sessions that
follow, Bush sometimes seems stumped, struggling to answer
questions about federal repayment of immigration costs to states
and the use of US troops in East Timor. But he does it all with a
wink and a pleading smile that seems to say, ``Go easy on me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And mostly, the voters do.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day, the bandwagon makes a hastily arranged stop
at a sunny plaza outside the Holy Redeemer Church in southwest
Detroit, a heavily Hispanic area that usually votes solidly
Democratic. Amid the mariachi music, an announcer's introduction
booms across the crowd assembled to celebrate Mexican Independence
Day: ``Senor George W. Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor strides on stage, speaking Spanish for a few
minutes, before bellowing, ``God Bless Mexico!'' to thunderous
applause. Beaming with delight, he sweeps his hand across the
audience and says, ``This is the American dream.'' The hundreds of
people, many of them waving Mexican flags freshly signed by Bush,
roar back their approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush, Bush!'' the chant begins. ``Viva Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the crowd is Benjamin Leiva, 42, who has never
voted before, but plans to back Bush. When Bush approaches a booth
set up by the Jobs Corps, Ranada Reid, 29, excitedly comes out from
behind the counter and tells the governor she has seen people
criticize him on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ignore them and be a good president,'' Reid tells Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will, or my Mom's going to get down on me,'' Bush says,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Reid says she has always supported Democrats but will
vote for Bush because ``he is a different kind of Republican. He
really cares about people.'' So what did Reid think about Bush's
father, former President Bush? Reid's face turned sour. ``President
Bush was plastic,'' she says. ``Governor Bush is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when asked, speaks warmly about the bond of love and
gratitude between son and father. But the former president's
political legacy is not an unalloyed blessing, which may explain
this: At more than 20 campaign events observed by a reporter this
summer, Bush never brought up his father's name except when the two
met at the family compound in Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leaves the Detroit event with a grin as wide as the festive
Mexican hats. His political strategy rests greatly on the theory
that he can win over Democrats and independents, by ``going where
Republicans usually don't go,'' as he puts it. If Bush wins the
Republican primary and becomes president, aides say, the key could
be groundwork laid in places like the sun-splashed courtyard of
Holy Redeemer Church.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of the Bush campaign sometimes is not so sunny. In
an ongoing Doonesbury cartoon strip, written by Bush's fellow Yale
alumnus Garry Trudeau, the governor is mercilessly portrayed as an
airhead who wears a cowboy hat, with frequent allusions to Bush's
refusal to say whether he used cocaine or other illegal drugs. It
is an issue rarely raised by voters at Bush's public events, but
often comes up in encounters with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day in New Hampshire, after traveling the state in
his Winnebago, Bush is pumped, smiling, his eyes handsomely
crinkled at the corners, ready for any question. Until, that is, a
reporter asks: Has the governor ever broken the law himself?
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier, Bush had lectured an audience about his plan
for a ``new era of responsibility,'' deriding a decade when people
said, ``If it feels good, do it.'' Bush warned of the evils of drug
use and alcohol abuse, and suggested that he had a place for those
who break the law: ``In Texas, we call it jail.'' The crowd loved
it, hooting and hollering as a beaming Bush left the podium.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the confines of ``Minnie the Winnie,'' the candidate
recoils, seeing the question as yet another way to pose the drug
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about what I did.'' Bush says sternly,
looking like he might show his visitor the exit. Then, winking, he
smiles and says: ``Nice try!'' And a moment later, ``It was
clever!'' But then he is stern again, declaring: ``It was not
clever. I have answered the question all I am going to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it passes. If there is a contradiction between his
words and deeds, Bush won't acknowledge it. He is having too much
fun as the front-runner campaigning for president, and he knows the
fun might fade in the coming months. The son of a former president
has seen his father lose campaigns in 1964, 1970, and 1992 for the
House, Senate, and presidency, so one of his favorite lines is that
he is ``not afraid of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens on a campaign trail is you end up looking at the
unvarnished person.'' Bush says in a moment of introspection. ``I
get tired. It is a grueling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Milford, N.H., a village-turned-suburb near the Massachusetts
border, the streets are blocked off and lined with security agents,
as if the president were about to arrive. Bush is swarmed as he
leaves the restaurant and takes a carefully choreographed walk to
the fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes raise the question: How did Bush soar so high so
fast in the polls. The answer is circular. He is high in the polls
because he has always been high in the polls, thanks to his name
recognition and the belief of many Republicans that he is most
likely to be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ask Bush about the polls, and he displays nothing but
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know principles,'' Bush says. ``People are
sickened by the politics of taking polls. I've never taken a poll
as governor to figure out what issue I should take a stand on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Bush insists he is running a grass-roots
campaign, albeit with $50 million in the bank, including a huge
amount from the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's fitting to launch a grass-roots campaign in a fire
station,'' Bush tells the crowd of 200 or so people inside the
sweltering fire station. The audience may not have grasped Bush's
logic, but most loved his message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech rarely varies. He always starts by saying he loves
his wife, Laura _ ``the best decision I ever made'' _ and his twin
17-year-old daughters. He wants to restore ``dignity to the Oval
Office,'' an allusion to President Clinton's infidelity. Then he
urges the audience to reject ``the politics of personal
destruction'' _ the sort of politics that would force him to say
more of the ``young and irresponsible'' ways he says he has left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   His is a broad-band message, crafted to appeal to Republicans,
independents, and even Democrats. And where he seems to contradict
himself, it seems not to bother the candidate or most in his
audience. Bush, for example, says the government can cut taxes
largely by eliminating many programs, but he has implied he would
boost the defense budget by billions of dollars because the country
must have a ``sharpened sword.''
</P>
<P>
   But when encountering the unexpected, he seems to lose his edge.
After Bush's stump speech to the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce
in Windham, N.H., a member of the audience rises to tell Bush about
his 25-year-old mentally retarded son. What will Bush do to help
the mentally retarded get jobs, asks Philip A. Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not appear to have thought about the matter. When
Pearson seems unsatisfied with Bush's vague promise to discuss the
issue, Bush shrugs and curtly ends the question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush knows he must fill in the blanks. For one thing, voters,
even admirers, tell him as much.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ryer, a recently relocated Texan who lives in Amherst,
N.H., greets the governor in Milford and says she is a big fan of
his. But she says that she has gone from definitely supporting Bush
to probably backing him, partly because she is intrigued by the
life story of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and
former Vietnam prisoner of war. ``I do look forward to hearing more
about the issues,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he plans to fill in many of the blanks this fall with
a series of policy announcements, but he sees no reason to hurry,
or to shift his overall message or tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to like the message and if it is working, why
change?'' Bush says, then adds, as if in confidence: ``By the way,
in the '94 campaign (for governor) I pretty much said the same
thing the entire campaign there, too.''

BIG MAN ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago a tall, beefy Irishman from Cambridge, Mass. got
himself elected speaker of the Massachusetts House.
</P>
<P>
   Tom to his wife and old friends, Tip to the rest of mankind, he
became US House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, blending the same yeasty
mixture of Irish stories, canny political judgments, and skillful
compromising at the national level as he had at home where he
discovered his own Newtonian theory of the civic universe: ``All
politics is local.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Depression he was one of the Boston Irish schoolboys who
took the streetcar to the end of the line at Chestnut Hill and
hiked up the slope to Boston College. When he enrolled only four
buildings were there to welcome the threadbare sons of immigrants
and turn them into Jesuit-educated men.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back on campus. In spirit, at least, in photographs, in
video and audio, in the very furniture that was in his Washington
office, as well as in 500 linear feet of storage boxes where his
papers, books, and the accumulated possessions of a half-century in
government and politics is collected, collated, and searched by
scholar and student alike.
</P>
<P>
   In the airy and capacious library that bears his name, a
permanent exhibit opens Friday tracking the life of the man who'll
be remembered as the last popular speaker. All who've succeeded him
have been swallowed up by toxic vapors of partisanship and
diminished by rancor.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wright and Newt Gingrich resigned under fire, diminished by
ethics investigations, isolated by partisan attacks. Tom Foley got
defeated in the '94 landslide that made Gingrich speaker; Newt's
designated successor, Bob Livingston, never even got the gavel,
resigning before taking formal control. And the present
post-impeachment speaker, Denny Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
blows an uncertain trumpet, presiding over a bare five-seat
majority whose members careen off in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   It was vastly different under O'Neill, before Gingrich's
right-wing posse poisoned the well of comity which had sustained
the House for the half-century since the Red Scare of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was friendlier and the government ran better when there
was more friendship and less hate-mongering in Washington. The
Beltway has gone the way of Beirut, Belfast, and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   You walk into the BC exhibit and there's a lifesize photo of
O'Neill at the door; you feel like shaking hands. From speakers and
video stations his throaty baritone dispenses quips and comments,
wit and wisdom. ``There are some things about politics that never
change: Giving your word and keeping it is still the bedrock. Vote
your conscience, your country, your district, the leadership, in
that order.''
</P>
<P>
   On one panel is a photo of Leo Diehl, O'Neill's closest
associate over a half-century of slugging it out in the political
trenches. There's the house on Russell Street in Cambridge, the
tribute to Sister Agatha from high school, the gang at Barry's
Corner, the presidents and potentates from the Washington years.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask any one of Boston College's thousands of living
alumni who did the most for their alma mater, after Ignatius of
Loyola, the answers would probably be the Rev. Donald Monan SJ,
Doug Flutie, Peter Lynch, and Tip O'Neill, in no particular order.
</P>
<P>
   Monan is the savvy priest whose deft touch guided BC through the
shoals to the Heights's present eminence. Flutie is the magical
quarterback whose pass (to beat Miami) is prologue to his present
(in Buffalo), but who made BC's reputation national and thereby
helped propel enrollment to its present heady level of 8,600
undergrads in a signature school. And Lynch is Fidelity's
Magellan-magician turned philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   But it was O'Neill, not the fleet-footed Flutie, who put BC on
the map in D.C., where the federal pie is carved, staging whopping
fund-raising dinners that drew lobbyists, industrialists and sundry
politicians and presidents who deemed it prudent to cultivate the
then-speaker of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig will be impossible to top as testament to O'Neill's
steam-shovel approach to federal largesse for his home turf. But BC
was never far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently helping close to 50 kids on partial
scholarships off the endowment of the O'Neill Scholarship Fund,
which stands close to $4 million,'' said Jim McIntyre, BC's senior
vice president. ``This will be a permanent exhibit. It embodies our
motto, `Men and women for others.' As speaker, he helped the needy,
the poor, did so much for health care and Social Security. The
money he raised for the scholarship fund means he'll be helping
people in perpetuity. He represented the very best in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a reception after the 4 p.m. dedication, with Mrs.
Millie O'Neill receiving a medal and daughter Rosemary speaking for
the family, along with BC's president, the Rev. William Leahy SJ,
US Representative Joe Moakley, and remarks by professor Shep
Melnick.
</P>
<P>
   Millie O'Neill will be presented with the Joseph Coolidge Shaw
S.J. Medal, named for the old Yankee scholar who was one of
Harvard's first Phi Beta Kappas in 1840, who converted to
Catholicism and left $4,000 and 2,000 books to what was to become
Boston College. So Shaw is revered as well as O'Neill, whose spirit
is invoked at the tail end of the exhibit, where, on a folding
table replicating a backroom campaign headquarters, there's an old
tin ashtray, and a half-smoked cigar. Perfect.

   When Sam Donaldson asked the inevitable past-drug-use question
to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley on ABC's ``This
Week'' on Sunday, I was hoping Bradley would respond with something
like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you know Sam, that Phil Jackson had some pretty powerful
`Maui Wowie' circulating in the Knicks' locker room in the early
1970s. Talk about getting a mellow buzz and havin' the munchies,
woo boy! So I learned my lesson about not hitting the bong too
hard, especially before a game with a tough opponent like the
Lakers. You can't play defense if you feel like you're underwater
and you think everything the refs do is hilarious, Samster.''

joined his campaign. Bulworth, Schmulworth, here's my man!

   Ah but not quite. Obviously having been prepped by his image
gurus, Bradley said, ``I've used marijuana several times, but never
cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   When Donaldson asked if there'd been any recent usage, Bradley
chuckled and said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the real fun began. Demonstrating a willingness to jab
and move that Al Gore can only dream about, Bradley volleyed the
question back at the Mr. Spock-looking Donaldson, who if he doesn't
look like drugs at least looks like something you'd see in a
mushroom-induced hallucination. Had Donaldson ever used illegal
drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple of times I've tried it,'' said Donaldson with
a chortle. ``And I inhaled.''
</P>
<P>
   A baked Sam Donaldson. The mind reels.
</P>
<P>
   Next it was co-panelist Cokie Roberts' turn to come clean. She
denied any drug use, saying, ``Oh listen, I was so pregnant during
those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? What years? What a weak and evasive answer! Cokie would
have fried George W. Bush if he'd been that elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was the suspiciously pink-faced George Will, who
had no choice but to jump into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Will, he'd never done drugs. Then he added: ``I'm
from the Falstaff generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, another oddball answer. Was the sophisticated, erudite
Will admitting a predilection for the beer they used to serve up at
the old Comiskey Park? Or was he making a cryptic reference to the
jovial knight Falstaff from Shakespeare's Henry IV?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. As I watched the tape of this bizarre, impromptu
confession-athon, I thought: You're all a bunch of wimps compared
to Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   For when it comes to youthful drug use, the legendary CBS
newsman tops them all. Dan Rather once did heroin.
</P>
<P>
   No joke. The straight-laced dean of network broadcasters once
tried smack, horse, the big H _ the most dangerous and seductive
drug of them all.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he told writer Cliff Jahr in an interview that
appeared in Ladies' Home Journal back in 1980. When the
conversation turned to how Rather would discuss such issues as
premarital sex and marijuana use with his children, Jahr asked
Rather about his own drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be coy with you,'' said Rather, after
initially dodging the query. ``I have not smoked pot in this
country. As a reporter _ and I don't want to say that's the only
context _ I've tried everything. I can say to you with confidence,
I know a fair amount about LSD. I've never been a social user of
any of these things, but my curiosity has carried me into a lot of
interesting areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent! But wait, it gets better. Much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an example,'' Rather continued, ``in 1955 or '56, I had
someone at the Houston police station shoot me with heroin so I
could do a story about it. The experience was a special kind of
hell. I came out understanding full well how one could be addicted
to `smack,' and quickly. When the children were fairly young, and
there was so much emphasis everywhere on drugs, it was not possible
for them to tell me I didn't know what I was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Take that, you beer-drinking, pot-toking Baby Bommer reporters!
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rather was on an all-day shoot for ``60 Minutes II'' on
Monday, and thus was unavailable to comment on his long-ago
admission of doing some pretty heavy research into the evils of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So we're left with the printed interview, in which he sounds for
all the world like J. Peterman confessing a flirtation with ``Lady
H'' to Elaine on an old episode of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   And we have the rest of Campaign 2000 to look forward to. Many
more months of reporters asking politicians about their drug use,
and politicians asking reporters about their drug use, and
reporters kidding each other about drug use _ and the voters being
driven to a druggy stupor by the inanity of it all.

APPLES: THE ALL-AMERICAN FRUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Proclaimed our national fruit by Ralph Waldo
Emerson, the 19th-century poet and essayist, apples are a wonderful
mirror for what is regarded as American.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they are far more diverse than most folks imagine;
there are more than 7,000 varieties, with more being developed all
the time. And, like so much of what we like to think of as
``American,'' apples have a rich history that predates this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting for a moment that famous land called Eden, the
ancient Egyptians planted apple trees and recorded on papyrus the
techniques they used. By 200 B.C. the Romans had cultivated seven
apple varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apples remain as American as can be. New York, the second
most prolific apple-growing state in the country (top honors go to
Washington), produces on average 25.24 million bushels of apples
every year.
</P>
<P>
   But how well do we know this seemingly simple fruit? Do most of
us realize that apples stored at room temperature deteriorate 10
times faster than refrigerated apples? Or that they shouldn't be
stored with broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, leafy
greens, lettuce or spinach because apples give off a gas that can
damage these vegetables?
</P>
<P>
   Each variety is unique in some ways, and apples that are tart
and crisp for eating don't always work well in pies. Here is a
primer for 10 of the most popular varieties of apple:
</P>
<P>
   _ McIntosh: Discovered in 1811 by John McIntosh, a native of
Vischers Ferry, it grows particularly well in New York's cool
climate.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Sweet with a tart tang, very juicy with tender,
white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating and sauce; good for salads and
pies.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: McIntosh's tender flesh cooks down quickly. Add a
thickener if making a pie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Delicious: Discovered around 1870 in Iowa by a Quaker,
Jesse Hiat, the popular, very sweet apple is now grown across the
country. What's it like: Sweet, juicy, with crisp, yellow flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating and salad.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Red Delicious look great for a long time, so they
are the favored choice for holiday centerpieces and wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   _ Empire: With the popular McIntosh and Red Delicious for
parents, the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in
Geneva introduced this variety in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Blend of sweet and tart, juicy, with very crisp,
creamy white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating and salads, good for sauce,
baking, pies and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Small Empires are great in school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cortland: Developed at the New York State Agricultural
Experiment Station in Geneva in 1898, it is a cross between Ben
Davis and McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Sweet with a hint of tartness, juicy and tender,
with snow white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating, salads, sauce, pies and baking;
good for freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Cortlands work well for kebabs, fruit plates and
garnishes because they don't turn brown quickly when cut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ida Red: Engineered in 1942 at the Idaho Experimental Station,
it's a cross between two old-fashioned New York state apples,
Jonathan and Wagener.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Sweetly tart, juicy with firm pale yellow-green
flesh that's sometimes tinted rosy pink.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for sauce, cooking, baking and pies; good
for eating, salads and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Ida Reds make a beautiful pink applesauce. Cook
the apples with the skins on and strain the sauce to get the best
pink color.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Rome: A superb cooking apple, perfect fried apple slices
sitting next to a pork chop are probably Red Romes.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Mildly tart with firm, greenish-white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for sauce, baking and pies; good for salad
and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Combine Red Romes with a sweet apple such as
Golden Delicious for tasty applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golden Delicious: Juicy and honey-sweet, it is related in name
only to the Red Delicious.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Mild sweet flavor, juicy, with crisp, light
yellow flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating, salads and sauce; good for
pies, baking and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: You can cut down the sugar in pies and sauces made
from Golden Delicious apples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crispin: Originally called the Mutsu, reflecting its Japanese
heritage, it was renamed in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Sweet yet very refreshing, very juicy and super
crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating, sauce, baking and freezing;
good for salad and pies.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Try Crispins for roasting whole apples or thick
slices, an accompaniment to a favorite roast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonagold: Another success story from the New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, it's a cross between
mellow Golden Delicious and tart Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Honey-sweet with a hint of tartness, juicy with
crisp, creamy yellow flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating, salads, sauce and baking; good
for pies and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Jonagolds make great fried apples. Simply saute in
a little butter and add a little cinnamon. No sugar needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Macoun: Developed in New York in 1932, it's a cross between
McIntosh and Jersey Black and named for a famous Canadian fruit
breeder.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like: Extra sweet and aromatic, very juicy and tender
with snow-white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Best uses: Excellent for eating; good for sauce and salads.
</P>
<P>
   Special hint: Try serving Macoun slices with cheese for an
autumn dessert.

<P>
   TAIWAN-QUAKE _ PULI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese by the thousands
threaded across half-ruptured bridges Wednesday, past fresh
rockslides and across miles of rippled asphalt to search for
relatives at the epicenter of the Taiwan earthquake. They found
that nature had dealt capriciously with this mountain town of
89,000 people closest to the quake's ground zero. Here and
elsewhere in Taiwan's hardest-hit Nantou County it looked as if the
quake had hopscotched across the landscape like a giant tornado,
devastating one place while leaving adjacent territory seemingly
untouched. Developing. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service). 30.

   BRITAIN-MLK _ LONDON _ Soviet spies attempted to recruit the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to their anti-American cause and
when they failed tried to discredit the civil rights leader as an
``Uncle Tom,'' according to a new book by a British scholar who has
researched KGB files. The book also says that Soviet agents tried
but failed to influence Andrew Young when he was the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations under President Jimmy Carter.

   TOBACCO-SUIT _ WASHINGTON _ Alleging a ``coordinated campaign of
fraud and deceit,'' the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit
against the major tobacco companies Wednesday in a bid to recover
billions of tax dollars it spent on treating smoking-related
illnesses. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WACO-PROBE _ WASHINGTON _ In a sign of startup difficulties for
the investigations into the 1993 Waco siege, special counsel John
Danforth complained that Senate investigators went to Texas
``without even troubling to give me a call.'' Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, sent back a message that he hadn't
known about the visit, either. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., had
sent the aides. Senators were divided on whether to conduct their
probe through a special task force or in the Judiciary Committee.

   LIFE-IN-AMERICA23 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ David Eldridge never thought
of high school football as a healer. The Lebanon High School
football parent, however, had his eyes opened last season when he
said last year's state champions transformed a town divided over a
school levy and other matters. ``It brought the community together.
It gave us something to rally around. People put their differences
aside and the school is better for it,'' Eldridge said. ``If the
football team is down, there's not that aura of cooperation amongst
everybody.'' He said football lets people cast aside prejudices
rooted in educational or financial differences. Respect becomes
performance- and effort-based. Ned Drees could have told Eldridge
all about the power of high school football. (Reines, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

at the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp was the emotional
highlight of a visit strong on symbolism. By Deborah Sontag.

   SAKS-OUTLOOK (New York) _ Saks Fifth Avenue, the venerable
clothier to the ladies who lunch, has just turned 75, but a placid
old age is not in the cards. Even with America in the midst of the
biggest income and retail boom of the century, Saks Fifth Avenue _
along with Neiman-Marcus, one of the nation's last two chains of
luxury department stores _ is struggling to make the kind of
profits Wall Street demands of retailers. The secret to
high-fashion success has always been finding the right balance
between nurturing cutting-edge design and stocking enough
money-making name brands to satisfy traditional customers. For
Saks, under new and very bottom-line-oriented management, that
balancing act has turned particularly precarious.

   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing an extraordinary moment in American religious
history. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reached the pinnacle of
publishing success: two New York Times bestsellers at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Since a person is more likely to die in a plane crash than write
a New York Times bestseller, for an author to have two books on the
list is big publishing news.
</P>
<P>
   And it is big religion news. No Protestant or Catholic religious
leader has ever achieved such success. Not the pope. Not Billy
Graham. A single religious book, maybe. But not two. The honor has
fallen to the Dalai Lama -- a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling Buddhist in a nation historically tied to
Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   The fourteenth Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader
of the Tibetan people. As the reincarnation of the former Dalai
Lamas, he embodies the spirit of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the Chinese hoped to eradicate Tibetan Buddhism by
taking over his county and forcing him into exile. For the last
forty years he has worked on behalf of his people. In 1989 he won
the Nobel Peace Prize and focused worldwide attention on Tibet's
plight.
</P>
<P>
   That Tibetan Buddhism, a complex philosophy demanding
disciplined meditation and study, should be gaining adherents in
the United States surprises most observers. But to true believers,
this only fulfills ancient prophecy: ``When the iron bird flies,
and horses run on wheels, the Tibetan people will be scattered like
ants across the world, and the Dharma (``truth'') will come to the
land of the Red Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Divinely appointed or not, Buddhism is coming into its own in
the United States. While the contemporary success of Buddhism may
seem something of a koan, its appeal is rooted in American
religious history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans first encountered Buddhism in the middle of the last
century. In 1844 the first European-language introduction to
Buddhism appeared. Combined with the founding of the American
Oriental Society that same year, Americans became aware of Buddhism
as a philosophy distinct from other eastern religions.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following, Asian immigrants brought Buddhism to the
United States and American missionaries encountered Buddhism
throughout the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Americans found Buddhism intriguing -- and a sophisticated
intellectual rival to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Thomas Tweed of the University of North Carolina notes
that between 1893 and 1907 Buddhism was ``in vogue.'' Americans
read about Buddhism in newspapers, magazines and novels. They
attended lectures given by Buddhists and formed Buddhist societies.
Prominent Americans, including the daughter of a Tennessee
governor, converted.
</P>
<P>
   One Baptist minister noted, ``There is great religious unrest
among us, and a growing dissatisfaction with Christianity, that
people are longing for another more satisfying faith, and that the
present is a most favorable time for the dissemination of
Buddhistic views: Shall we all become Buddhists?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1893 a newspaper reported, ``It is no uncommon thing to hear
a New Yorker say he is a Buddhist nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Episcopal minister defended his visit to a Buddhist
shrine: ``In these days when a large part of Boston prefers to
consider Buddhist rather than Christian, I consider it to be a duty
of a minister who preaches to Bostonians.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, ministers worried that Buddhism would
displace Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1900, only a couple thousand Americans had converted to
Buddhism. But tens of thousands more were sympathetic to it. A
century later, the ratio is probably similar _ more Americans flirt
with Buddhism than actually embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal? Many late-nineteenth-century Americans sensed a
spiritual crisis. Traditional faiths, particularly Christianity,
failed to account for new scientific questions and social changes.
Buddhism offered alternate ways to understand these problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians believed Buddhism to be more rational than their
own faith and more compatible with science, particularly Darwinism.
Only last summer, conservative Christians in Kansas restricted the
teaching of evolution, thus causing their more thoughtful
co-religionists considerable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much American Christianity, Buddhism allows for both
rigorous scientific inquiry and faithful spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism was also believed more tolerant than other faiths. With
religious diversity increasing _ both then and now _ Buddhist
insistence on the fundamental truths of all religious paths is
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent survey, Californians identified Buddhists as
``more Christian'' than Christians in their ability to accept
others. Accordingly, Buddhism opens optimistic possibilities for
inter-religious understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Buddhism is as Americans depict it, Americans have long
romanticized Buddhism as a way out of problems created by their own
history _ entangled as it is with western Christianity. Popular
interest in Buddhism tends to reemerge when inherited faiths appear
intellectually inadequate or overly restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, spiritual seekers are going outside tradition and
the question, ``Shall we all become Buddhists?'' seems more
relevant than ever.

<P>
   NY-TOWNHOUSE (New York) _ On the lean, modern house Clarissa
Alcock Bronfman and her husband, Edgar Bronfman Jr., have just
built for themselves. The landmarked facade of the Upper East Side
townhouse is laced with wrought iron detailing and a neoclassical
restraint that Edith Wharton would have loved. Step inside, and you
forget the past: Where traditional wood once reigned, the vestibule
is now paneled in sheets of steel, waxed to a warm shade of bronze.
Two steps up, a steel and glass door swings open to a sunfilled
piazza. By Jule Iovine.

<P>
   ARIZ-SOLAR-HOUSE (Tonopah, Ariz.) _ From the highway, it is six
miles to Brenda Black's house near Tonopah, along a dusty road
through boulders and saguaro cactus. For the first four miles, a
power line parallels the road. But then the necklace of wooden
poles and black cables _ the reassuring accompaniment to millions
of miles of American highways _ ends. The house is still 1,000 feet
away. In Arizona, it is becoming easy for ordinary families to live
``off the grid'' _ that is, without a hookup to electric lines _
and not sacrifice comfort. By Fred Bernstein.

</P>
<P>
   GOETHE-GARDEN-HOUSE (Weimar, Germany) _ Weimar has been enjoying
a year of being the official European ``cultural capital,'' a
designation prompted by Goethe's 250th birthday in August. Rather
than simply polish up Weimar's many landmarks, the organizers
challenged their visitors with an experimental conjuring trick.
They constructed an exact copy of the city's most famous building,
Goethe's Garden House, a hundred yards from the original. By Jan

WOMEN TURN BEAUTY PRODUCTS IDEA INTO ON-LINE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Who ever heard of buying cosmetics on line? You
can't touch them, smell them, try them. But then, if you live in
Helena, Mont., or somewhere in Guam, there probably isn't a decent
high-end cosmetics counter in sight to purchase those delicious
luxury goods that show up in Vogue, W and Harper's Bazaar. What's a
girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   Log on, of course.
</P>
<P>
   According to Women's Wear Daily, there are 18 beauty e-tailing
sites. To name just a few, there's iBeauty.com, jasmin.com
(fragrance only), eve.com, plus huge new drugstore sites _
planetrx.com, owned by powerful French conglomerate LVMH (Louis
Vuitton Moet Hennessey) and drugstore.com, which is affiliated with
amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But by this time next year, you can be sure that some of them
will have disappeared into the Great Virtual Void. The ones that do
make it will have a lot of money behind them and experienced
cosmetic industry professionals at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, one of the most promising beauty addresses on the
World Wide Web is gloss.com, the brainchild of two former
executives with Bath and Body Works who met in Columbus, Ohio, and
escaped as fast as they could.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Columbus is such a bad place, but it did lend
itself to some daydreaming, which gloss.com's founder and chief
executive Sarah Kugelman, 35, did in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with this idea four years ago,'' said Kugelman, a
slender New Yorker with a wild mane of honey-blond hair and that
go-go mein of someone who lives by Palm Pilot, e-mail and laptop.
</P>
<P>
   When she made a presentation to the president of Bath and Beauty
Works, a division of The Limited, about the huge retailing
potential of an on-line beauty and bath product site, ``I was told:
`It's not important.'''
</P>
<P>
   But someone else at that boardroom table heard and understood,
and told her not to lose sight of the site _ ``It's the future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, B&AMP;BW was building retail stores. When Kugelman
arrived, there were 100; when she left, there were 750, and it is
possible that the president wasn't exactly thinking beyond real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Kugelman did not lose her vision. Through a move to New York and
a stint in Banana Republic's burgeoning fragrance/home department,
Kugelman, with another former B&AMP;BW exec, Deanna Kangas, 33, who is
gloss.com's co-founder and vice president of marketing, worked out
a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sat in a drawer for two or three years,'' said Kugelman,
and then at a dinner party in January a banker heard her talking
about The Plan. ``What I didn't know was that he had raised $70
million for iVillage,'' Kugelman said. When the banker asked: ``Do
you understand what you're sitting on?'' she hardly knew what to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Within six weeks, that banker had snagged $4.75 million to
launch gloss.com. Recently, the site has gone through its second
round of funding, bringing in $20 million. One of the problems
involved in securing funding, however, was that ``men didn't
understand the impulse concept around cosmetics,'' Kugelman said.
``When we started talking about it, they'd glaze over. I had to
tell them: More women I know use lipstick than read books.''
</P>
<P>
   In building a new site, which is scheduled to be launched on
Sept. 27, it was necessary for gloss.com to secure a product. The
decision was made to go after innovative, smaller companies
(although some of the majors will eventually sign up) whose
distribution or number of ``doors'' is very small. (``Doors'' is a
cosmetic industry term for how many stores the products are sold
in.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told a brand like Philosophy to consider us their main
on-line `door,''' said Kangas, indicating that there has been some
education involved about the fiscal possibilities of on-line
merchandising. The only difference between a Nordstrom cosmetic
department and gloss.com is the touchy-feely aspect and the instant
gratification of being able to take the product home immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For that customer, however, who is geographically isolated and
logging on from a small town or one in which the biggest brand she
can buy is Revlon, cosmetic satisfaction is just a keystroke away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brands include Peter Thomas Roth, a line of excellent skin
products (particularly the tinted moisturizer and sunblock)
heretofore available only from facialists and spas; Cielo, Tom and
Susan Hayward's Napa Valley Fragrances; Three Custom Color, which
will match any fabric swatch for eyeshadow or your favorite
out-of-stock lipstick; Tony and Tina, a youthful color line; Calvin
Klein fragrance; and Philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go for prestige department store and unique
boutique and European brands _ the kind you'd find at Barney's (in
New York) and Fred Segel (in Los Angeles),'' Kugelman said.
</P>
<P>
   The home page of gloss.com has links to all the products,
arranged in five key categories: fragrance, skin care, color, home
fragrance and accessories. There is a master list of what's
available and with a simple click, each company has a brand page
with images controlled by the companies themselves, color swatches
and descriptions of each product. Part of the interactive component
is a virtual makeover where a user will be able to scan in her own
image and then experiment with different shades of lipstick, eye
shadow and blush, which is almost like being there, or so it is
hoped.

old _ is a bright, shining cathedral. The change was due to a

SIERRA CLUB OUT OF TOUCH ON URBAN DEVELOPMENT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sierra Club took an unexpected hit July 5,
when it was called elitist in a full-page advertisement in the New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Sierra Club were predictably indignant. They
claimed to deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. ``Racist'' and ``fascist'' also were
kicked around by the militant young copywriters at the Greenlining
Institute, which bought the ad space for the big-type screed. The
institute, like the Sierra Club, is a San Francisco-based
organization with a vision of how things should be. I'm told the
authors of the ad were restrained by their boss, John Gamboa, who
sees the Sierra Club as a potential ally.
</P>
<P>
   The institute wants to transform California's estimated 30,000
fallow inner-city lots, or ``brownfields,'' into sites for
educational, commercial and recreational activities for inner-city
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club could help to put this effort into orbit, but it
is balking. People at the institute think that is because the
Sierra Club is just a group of self-important white liberals who
don't have a clue about real life in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   Which could indeed be the case with regard to some members. I
think of the Sierrans as aging tree huggers who have upgraded from
Birkenstocks to Kenneth Cole, from VWs to BMWs and from granola to
eggs benedict, as the value of their stock portfolios has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Well intended. Good at planning vacations. Not as effective as
they could be if they went farther out on a limb, politically, than
their comfortable lifestyles permit. The Greenliners, on the other
hand, see them as faux progressives who talk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlining Institute, which has an office on Market Street
within walking distance of the Sierra Club's national headquarters
in San Francisco, is a coalition of 50 community-based civil rights
and minority small-business organizations dedicated to improving
inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It is mainly led by Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians. In
the past, the institute has gone after insurers and banks for
redlining inner-city minorities, and much of its annual income of
about $1.5 million comes from lawsuits it wins or settles.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the institute has turned its sights on the thousands
of abandoned inner-city properties that may or may not be too
contaminated by commercial and industrial wastes to be redeveloped
lawfully and at reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of economic justice, the Greenliners want to ease
the laws applying to potential development on these properties so
that an African-American parochial school, say, can turn a nearby
brownfield into a playground without being forced to excavate to a
depth that breaks the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, a small business might be encouraged to move in,
if the cost of building a parking lot on a brownfield site was not
prohibitive. The institute balances community needs with
environmental goals, favoring the former but not to the exclusion
of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, in the last legislative session in Sacramento, the
institute backed SB 324, a measure by state Sen. Martha Escutia,
D-Commerce. SB 324 would have been a first step in turning those
fields of brown into fields of gold.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature would have written into law the practice of
calibrating cleanups to planned uses, with sites more likely to
expose people to toxins _ residential and recreational sites, most
obviously _ held to higher standards. The measure went nowhere. The
institute is convinced Sierra Club lobbyists shot it down.
</P>
<P>
   When Sierra Club director Carl Pope responded to a letter from
Gamboa inquiring about the club's concerns _ two months after it
was sent _ he indicated SB 324 was defective because it bypassed
existing safeguards and threatened liability and cleanup standards.
In other words, it was too lax.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa claims to have gotten 300 calls or electronic-mail
messages in response to the ad, about half from Sierra Club
members, 40 percent of whom, he said, thought the criticism of
their own organization was on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep resentment against the Sierra Club that goes
back many years,'' Gamboa said. ``The theme is this is a white
elitist group telling us, again, what's good for us. How dare they?
This is a self-determination thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the ad was ``unfortunate,'' but he declined to get in
a shouting match. He emphasized the seriousness of the toxics
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disagreement about whether particular changes in
the law will or will not expose kids to dangers,'' Pope said. ``We
might be wrong. He might be wrong. The reality is: Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. Reasonable efforts to improve the situation shouldn't be
undermined, least of all by privileged outsiders.
</P>

of miles of American highways _ ends. The house is still 1,000 feet

ARLINGTON, Texas: strong, McNeill said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Industry insiders emphasize that all musical genres go through
boom and bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Country surged after the ``Urban Cowboy'' phenomenon in the
1970s. It lapsed for several years, compelling country supergroup
Alabama to perform a duet with pop star Lionel Richie at the 1985
Country Music Association Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The genre began working up steam again around 1986, when Randy
Travis captured the charts from Kenny Rogers, and exploding in 1989
with the likes of Brooks and Dunn and Clint Black.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers attribute some of the trouble to the fact that
once country heated up, record companies rushed to sign anybody who
looked or sounded like the new kids, whether they had the right
stuff or not.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have defected to talk radio and music competitors, and the
radio powerhouses are scrambling to bring them back.
</P>
<P>
   The crossover success of artists such as LeAnn Rimes hasn't
necessarily helped country radio either.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rimes scored country's first multi-platinum single.
She is also only the second female recording artists to sell 3
million or more on a single. But country stations aren't
necessarily cheering her success.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes' big hit, ``How Can I Live Without You,'' received much of
its support from pop fans. And if a listener can hear a song on his
or her favorite pop radio station, there's little reason to turn
the dial to country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem comes when ... people don't have to turn the dial
to hear the kind of music they like,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many country radio folks think the slide has bottomed
out.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the feeling among people like KSCS music
director Linda O'Brian.
</P>
<P>
   She is convinced that there's another corral full of talent
ready to break out of the chute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're due for another cycle,'' she said. ``I see
future Alan Jacksons and future George Straits. I don't feel that
bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Rogers, director of national promotions for Columbia
Records, a division of Sony in Nashville, Tenn., said that the past
six months have yielded new signs of life in country.
</P>
<P>
   His label is notching a record year so far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we've bottomed out,'' he said.''We're seeing a
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shipped two million copies on the Dixie Chicks,'' he said.
``That's more than we have ever shipped in Sony history.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who have a long memory, 2 million _ or half that _
shows just how far country has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when 100,000 was a monster,'' North Texas
promoter Johnnie High said. And as far as he's concerned, country
music could hardly get any better. His weekly Arlington country
music revue is broadcast on seven 50,000-watt stations from Idaho
to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all Sony has to do is move those 2 million Dixie
Chicks CDs. Considering that the disc will probably be gold by
month's end, according to Recording Industry Association sources _
it's at No. 1 on the country and Billboard Top 200 charts right now
_ it looks pretty likely.
</P>
<P>
   And if the company can get enough Chicks fans into the record
stores, the odds are that they'll pick up a disc or two by other
new artists.

COUNTRY MUSIC HAS PLENTY OF REASONS FOR HEARTACHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
and SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Heartbreak, hangovers and hard times are what
country music is all about.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, it's the state of the industry, not the songs, that
has radio programmers, artists and Nashville executives crying in
their beer.
</P>
<P>
   Country record sales are bottoming out. Radio stations are
dropping the format. Word is, even The Nashville Network is
planning to ax its flagship country show in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically back to audience numbers that we had in
1988,'' said KYNG/105.3 FM program director Bob McNeill. ``From
spring '98 to spring '99, 11 percent of the core hour (of
listeners) has left the format.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is suggesting that country music is out _ all genres go
through boom and bust cycles, and the new Dixie Chicks CD sold
341,000 copies its first week _ but it is indisputably down,
locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The slump dates back as far as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Country music sales hit a whopping $2 billion that year, up from
$723 million in 1990. But the genre was down from what may have
been a historic peak in 1993, when Garth Brooks and his country
cousins accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sales slipped to 16.7 percent of the market by '95 and by 1998
were down to 14.1 percent of the market, according to the Recording
Industry Association of America. Statistics for 1999 were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, Brooks talked about the state
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our format is looking for its identity right now,''
Brooks said. ``When they let people make the kind of country that's
interesting, people will turn over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks attributed part of the slump to the loss of country
stations in big markets such as Seattle. He also noted that the
number of venues for live performances has dwindled from when he
was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing one huge element: the dance halls,'' Brooks
said. ``I don't know where the new guys are playing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The current downturn has everybody from performers to radio
programmers wondering when _ or whether _ country will once again
pack the power to kick weaker formats off radio dials and redefine
mainstream tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks himself is making his next release a rock 'n' roll
project.
</P>
<P>
   To stanch the wounds locally, radio executives have tightened
play lists, ``rebranded'' their stations with new identities, and
added left-of-center acts such as singer/songwriter Robert Earl
Keen. But what radio is really waiting for is the second coming of
Garth _ someone who can lasso fans from other genres and still
appeal to core country listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is not pretty,'' McNeill said. ``The last
couple of years, most of us have been sitting around wringing our
hands and saying, `Oh, gosh.'''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five years ago, country stations held two of the
top three quarterly local ratings spots. The three top country
local radio stations consistently appeared in the top 10 quarterly
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, many of the fans who filled stadiums to see country
acts and tuned in country radio in the early and mid-'90s now
prefer genres such as rock, which has grown more listener-friendly
since five years ago, when Seattle grunge was strong, McNeill said.

 &HT;    BOOK: SOVIET KGB TRIED TO RECRUIT, DISCREDIT MARTIN LUTHER KING
 &HT;    580&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hoping to fuel America's racial strife during the early
1960s Soviet spies tried to influence Martin Luther King Jr. as he
led the burgeoning civil rights movement, according to a new book
by a British scholar.
</P>
<P>
   And when attempts to control King failed, the KGB concocted a
plan to discredit him among blacks by depicting him as an ``Uncle
Tom,'' the book says.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Sword and the Shield,'' also contends that
communist operatives tried to influence Andrew Young when he was
ambassador to the United Nations during the Carter Administration.
The KGB didn't have much more success with Young.
</P>
<P>
   The former ambassador, now an Atlanta businessman, said
Wednesday that he found the book's assertions ironic. ``Well, for
years the FBI tried to say that Martin and I were communists, so
it's good to hear from the KGB side that they weren't able to get
to us,'' Young said. ``It's a thrill to know they tried to mess
with me and failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's author, Christopher Andrew, is a history professor at
Cambridge University and a frequent writer on Soviet espionage.
Andrew based this book on information provided by Vasili Mitrokhin,
a KGB archivist who retired in 1984 and smuggled hundreds of
classified documents to Britain. The book went on sale in the
United States on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrokhin files, which the British considered reliable
enough to share with the CIA and FBI, have offered Western
intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of
historical information about KGB operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the books most startling revelations is the case of
Melita Norwood, an 87-year-old great-grandmother who passed
information about Britain's atomic bomb program to the Soviets
during the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, American Communist Party leaders told Soviet
officials they would try to influence King by employing ``secret
party members within King's entourage,'' the book says. However,
KGB officials determined by the mid-1960s that this strategy was
failing. To the KGB's dismay, King was arguing that the civil
rights movement should fight to include blacks in the American
Dream rather than destroying the American system.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the KGB sought to replace him with someone more
radical, such as then-Black Panther Party leader Stokeley
Carmichael, the book says. In August 1967, the Soviet spy agency
tried to discredit King by placing stories in African newspapers
depicting him as an ``Uncle Tom.'' The articles said that President
Lyndon Johnson's administration was giving King secret ``government
subsidies to tame the civil rights movement.'' The KGB believed he
U.S. media would pick up these stories.
</P>
<P>
   When King was assassinated in April 1968, the KGB switched its
approach, the book says. The agency's covert operatives in the
United States then began to portray King as a ``martyr of the black
liberation movement.'' They began circulating rumors that ``his
murder had been planned by white racists with the connivance of the
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, American Communist Party leaders boasted that they
expected to be able to influence Young, a former King lieutenant
whom Carter made United Nations ambassador. The book quotes Gus
Hall, longtime leader of the Communist Party of the United States,
as saying: ``Young himself did not know that several of his close
friends in Atlanta were covert communists, and he listened to
them.'' However, KGB officials considered Hall's assessment
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Lesiovsky, a KGB officer working as special assistant to
then-U.N. Secretary General U Thant, met frequently with Young and
reported that he received ``important information'' from these
meetings. However, Lesiovsky reported to the KGB that Young's
attitude toward the Soviet Union was ``fundamentally negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was unaware at the time that Lesiovsky was with
the KGB. He said he did tip off the Soviets to American initiatives
coming before the Security Council as a matter of good politics.
``We never received a Russian veto of anything we were trying to
put through,'' he said. ``I worked well with the Russians and we
achieved everything we wanted to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections between King and his lieutenants and American
communists have been studied extensively before, and at least one
scholar who has studied King was unimpressed with much of what he
has read in the book.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a history professor at Emory University in
Atlanta, said it all sounded pretty familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing new here other than the assertion that
the KGB was going to portray King as an Uncle Tom in the African
press,'' said Garrow, who wrote the 1981 book ``The FBI and Martin
Luther King Jr.'' ``And that's incredibly loony.''

FORGET DOT.COM AND INVENT ARTIFCIAL KNEE LIGAMENTS! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the cruel and capricious game of football
survives a decade or two into the 21st century, maybe some genius
will take a break from the mounting dot-com dreck and figure out a
way to make and install artificial knee ligaments for the sport's
student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it: super-strong, resilient knee ligaments, made of
some as-yet unknown material, capable of withstanding the front
bumper of a Lexus at 30 miles an hour, attached to your favorite
running back. The stuff would combine the elasticity of a gymnast
with the strength of steel and snap back into place with no damage
to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like some of this future fabric down in Atlanta. An MRI
of Jamal Anderson's right knee revealed a torn anterior cruciate
ligament, meaning the Falcons' running back is out for the
remainder of the season. All because he planted his foot Monday
night in Texas Stadium and his knee kept on going.
</P>
<P>
   It's an artificial turf injury, to be sure, and it underscores
the utterly evil nature of the stuff and its incompatibility with
human beings engaged in the inhuman activity of football.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``How 'bout those 49ers?''
</P>
<P>
   Their task just got a little easier with Tuesday's news about
Anderson, who was unstoppable last season as he carried an
NFL-record 410 times for 1,846 yards. Ask Merton Hanks how
unstoppable Anderson was; he's the reason Hanks is now a Seattle
Seahawk, waived by Bill Walsh because he couldn't tackle the
235-pound Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of preparing to face Anderson twice in 1999, the 49ers
will not see him at all, except on the sidelines. For Atlanta, his
loss is similar to what the 49ers are going through without
Garrison Hearst. Without a feature back, an offense loses focus and
becomes more diffuse, with several inferior people trying to make
up for what one man did so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly for Jamal Anderson,'' 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
said. ``He's a heck of a player, a heck of a guy. I hate to see it
happen to anybody. You hate to see a professional athlete sit for
the year with a season-ending injury. It's a tough, tough break. We
all know as coaches and players that that sort of thing happens on
occasion and we have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will try to make do with Bryon Hanspard, who is not
Jamal Anderson. That puts the burden on quarterback Chris Chandler,
the human equivalent of a road sign on a lonely stretch of desert.
</P>
<P>
   That is, all shot up, dented and chipped but still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler missed Monday night's game against Dallas with a groin
injury. Such injuries become worse with age and more than a few
athletes have faded into retirement because of them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the oddity of the schedule, the 49ers do not play the
Falcons until Dec. 12 at Candlestick but then face them twice in a
three-week period. The second game wraps up the regular season on
Monday night, Jan. 3, 2000, in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of those folks who believes the new century begins in
the year 2000, simply because of the number 2 followed by three
zeroes. The 20th century will end on Dec. 31, 1999, with, we
believe, more people engaged in bedroom activity than at any time
in history because of the rare opportunity to, ahem, carry on from
one century to another. Now that's staying power!
</P>
<P>
   We bring up the subject of the new century because if football
is to survive, it will have to do something about the ruinous toll
knee injuries take.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for some genius in a garage or a lab to combine This,
That and The Other Thing and create something to take the place of
human knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science has already given us artificial hips and knees
and prosthetic devices to aid the impaired. Why not ligaments?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is one of the young stars in the NFL, a delight to
watch but tough to tackle as he uses his low center of gravity and
his 235 pounds to punish those in his way. The league needs him
churning those thunder thighs to make its product more watchable.
</P>
<P>
   That's of no concern to the 49ers, of course. They have their
own problems, such as how to keep Steve Young healthy for 14 more
games and how to run the ball effectively without Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   While their secondary is suspect, the 49ers look like they will
be decent against the run, based on how they defended
Jacksonville's Fred Taylor (74 yards) and New Orleans' Ricky
Williams (80). And now Williams has a sprained right elbow that
might limit his ability to do such football-y things as carry the
ball in his tiny right hand and catch the darn thing as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new century figures to bring many wonderful things, starting
with horizontal hilarity on an epic scale. Football's wish list is
more modest. Artificial ACLs, perhaps?

TURKEY VULTURES CREATE RUCKUS IN CALIFORNIA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCED, Calif. _ Turkey vultures have tightened their talons on
a five-block stretch of one of the busiest boulevards in this
Central Valley town, generating a neighborly conflict that could
almost be described as agitated.
</P>
<P>
   At six pounds or so of body weight, the birds are round in the
roost. They have naked little heads, alien eyes and can measure up
to six feet in wingspan, and they regurgitate their carrion prey at
the first hint of distress.
</P>
<P>
   And here they are, content in the 60-foot limbs of two parallel
lines of eucalyptus along M Street. There are at least 200 of the
big, fat turkey vultures hovering over the four-lane avenue near
the north section of Merced, a town with nearly 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   To some townsfolk, the birds have become a public threat; to
others they are an environmental wonder. But Monday evening, as
residents on both sides of the debate watched from their lawns or
along the narrow sidewalks of M Street, the vultures became a
target of a vulture-relocation project sought by city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks were used to roust from their roosts a multitude of
birds that, as near as anyone could tell, promptly flew back home
after flying in graceful circles overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Partch, a wildlife specialist from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, who was in charge of firing off the pyrotechnic
devices, was not bothered. It was expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to do is make the birds uncomfortable,''
Partch said, adding that the fireworks would be back every night
until the birds were gone.
</P>
<P>
   The flock of the vultures has lived, for as long as anyone can
remember, in the trees long before houses were built, around 1975.
Some say that this year there are more than ever, and they have
some mighty unpleasant habits.
</P>
<P>
   When startled, turkey vultures defend themselves by
regurgitating their last meals _ dinners that were dead long before
the 5-pound scavengers with 6-foot wingspans took their first
tentative nibble. Also, they defecate and drop feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballyhooed effort to drive the birds out of town used what
had been characterized as pyrotechnics. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ones that pop and we have ones that whistle,'' Partch
said early in the program as he moved his white pickup from block
to block, stopping at each intersection to pop or whistle at the
birds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The popping pyrotechnics were louder than a ladyfinger but
considerably quieter than a cherry bomb. The whistlers _ fired from
a Baretta-style flare gun _ sounded like airborne party favors.
</P>
<P>
   More volume came from protesters _ mostly, but not entirely,
adolescent _ who gathered along M Street and, at the first salvo,
yelled wry epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are bird droppings and there are times I have to
clear, off my car, but that's nothing to do with the environment,
so save the birds,'' declared Claudia Linke, who lives near M
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here two years and they keep multiplying,
especially this year,'' countered Lupe Septien, whose house
occupies a corner at M and Donna streets. ``That said, I have to go
skim my pool because all the turkey feathers are in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Long of the California Academy of Sciences in San
Francisco couldn't relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it's cool as heck if I had a bunch of turkey
vultures in my back yard, but I'm kind of a nut for that stuff,''
said Long, who holds a doctorate in ornithology.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that ``it's sort of a low-grade health issue when
you have birds vomiting their food, but it's not a hazardous
situation''
</P>
<P>
   While arguing that dogs or cats ``pass more diseases to their
owners'' than turkey vultures, Long sympathized with Merced
residents on an elemental level. ``Having a bird that's the size of
a small turkey, black with a bald head, peering down at you and
throwing up bones of road kill'' might not be ideal, he said.

CHURCH SHOOTING REFLECTS OUR NATIONAL SHORT TEMPER

<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Following the Fort Worth church shooting, one woman commented,
``If something like that can happen in a church, it can happen
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans revere two public places -- school and church.
For generations, learning and faith guarded our village greens,
main streets and frontier towns.
</P>
<P>
   They embodied the national ideal of a moral democracy. To
paraphrase, ``if it can happen there, it attacks our soul.''
</P>
<P>
   School and church have been violated by a murder spree beyond
comprehension. What has happened in our most sacred places and to
children, our most vulnerable members? We are sad, confused and
exhausted by this violence. We struggle to find meaning amid the
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   On the PBS news program, ``Religion and Ethics Weekly,'' Mark
Wingfield, an editor of the Baptist Standard newspaper, reported
that many conservative Christians see the latest violence ``as
symptomatic of the larger cultural war'' in American society-- a
``spiritual battle between light and dark in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation, being promoted by the religious right,
appeals to those most immediately affected. The slain children and
teachers did not die needlessly. They were victims of a great
cosmic drama -- the unfolding war between God and the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Theologically, this is the stuff of martyrdom. It draws
believers into a biblical epic with eternal consequences. Parents
and friends find comfort that their loved ones died for a
purpose,not at the random behest of a troubled classmate or madman.
</P>
<P>
   However theologically comforting to some, this interpretation
ignores some of the more difficult aspects of the violence.
Although conservative Christians have been targets, others have
been targeted as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Columbine victims was black and apparently singled
out because of his race. One religious target was not a church,it
was a Jewish daycare center. And other hate crimes? Recall Matthew
Sheperd, the gay student in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   There is something deeper here than, as Wingfield noted, ``a
growing climate of hostility against Christians.'' There is an evil
spirit roaming the land, a spirit of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The line, however, between good and evil is not external. It is
not a matter of picking sides in a cosmic war. Rather, a line seems
to run through all of us. We have a national short temper. Bad
driving and road rage. Greed and materialism. Child abuse and
domestic violence. Rudeness, foul language, poor manners.
</P>
<P>
   The whole of society is infected with self-centeredness and less
dramatic violence. We chooseeach time we get behind the wheel of a
carwhether we will be violent people or not.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine and Fort Worth distract us by placing blame on an
external force. They gave us scapegoats -- Hollywood, video games,
guns and rock music. But if we could look in a national mirror, we
would see our own faces contorted with anger. Human beings, all
human beings, are capable of hurting others.
</P>
<P>
   Few are innocent of this ``lesser'' violence. Most -- but
certainly not all -- of us just don't pull triggers when we are
teed off. We seethe, gossip, demean, belittle and yell. We commit
acceptable acts of violence against fellow human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``Ethics for the New Millennium,'' the Dalai
Lama says violence is caused by our lack compassion, which he
describes as ``a feeling of intimacy toward all other sentient
beings, including, of course, those who would harm us.''
</P>
<P>
   Compassion is the foundation of most major world religions.
Biblical traditionsChristianity, Judaism, and Islamidentify
compassion as God's primary characteristic. God is Love and loving
others embodies the divine. Eastern religions link wisdom and
compassion to enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its universality, compassion is perhaps the most
difficult of all virtues. Our own failures to be compassionate --
we rarely love our neighbor as ourselves -- lie at the center of
all that shames us.
</P>
<P>
   We do not love as we should. So, we imagine wars in heaven. But
the main war is insidewhen we hate the guy who cuts in the grocery
store line.
</P>
<P>
   How to stop the violence? Gun control? Metal detectors? Mass
revivals?
</P>
<P>
   White Christians have much to learn from their Jewish,
African-American and homosexual neighbors. Sometimes people hate
because they hate. It does not make much sense. There have always
been and will always be Hitlers, slavery, gay-bashingand Eric
Harrises and Larry Ashbrooks.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of indiscriminate violence, weas individuals and in
communitiesmust practice compassion through personal integrity and
acceptance of others. Ending violence starts when we commit our own
hearts to peacemaking. Honest people know this spiritual battle is
within.
</P>

CHURCH SHOOTING REFLECTS OUR NATIONAL SHORT TEMPER

</P>
<P>
   Following the Fort Worth church shooting, one woman commented,
``If something like that can happen in a church, it can happen
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans revere two public places -- school and church.
For generations, learning and faith guarded our village greens,
main streets and frontier towns.
</P>
<P>
   They embodied the national ideal of a moral democracy. To
paraphrase, ``if it can happen there, it attacks our soul.''
</P>
<P>
   School and church have been violated by a murder spree beyond
comprehension. What has happened in our most sacred places and to
children, our most vulnerable members? We are sad, confused and
exhausted by this violence. We struggle to find meaning amid the
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   On the PBS news program, ``Religion and Ethics Weekly,'' Mark
Wingfield, an editor of the Baptist Standard newspaper, reported
that many conservative Christians see the latest violence ``as
symptomatic of the larger cultural war'' in American society-- a
``spiritual battle between light and dark in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation, being promoted by the religious right,
appeals to those most immediately affected. The slain children and
teachers did not die needlessly. They were victims of a great
cosmic drama -- the unfolding war between God and the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Theologically, this is the stuff of martyrdom. It draws
believers into a biblical epic with eternal consequences. Parents
and friends find comfort that their loved ones died for a
purpose,not at the random behest of a troubled classmate or madman.
</P>
<P>
   However theologically comforting to some, this interpretation
ignores some of the more difficult aspects of the violence.
Although conservative Christians have been targets, others have
been targeted as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Columbine victims was black and apparently singled
out because of his race. One religious target was not a church,it
was a Jewish daycare center. And other hate crimes? Recall Matthew
Sheperd, the gay student in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   There is something deeper here than, as Wingfield noted, ``a
growing climate of hostility against Christians.'' There is an evil
spirit roaming the land, a spirit of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The line, however, between good and evil is not external. It is
not a matter of picking sides in a cosmic war. Rather, a line seems
to run through all of us. We have a national short temper. Bad
driving and road rage. Greed and materialism. Child abuse and
domestic violence. Rudeness, foul language, poor manners.
</P>
<P>
   The whole of society is infected with self-centeredness and less
dramatic violence. We chooseeach time we get behind the wheel of a
carwhether we will be violent people or not.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine and Fort Worth distract us by placing blame on an
external force. They gave us scapegoats -- Hollywood, video games,
guns and rock music. But if we could look in a national mirror, we
would see our own faces contorted with anger. Human beings, all
human beings, are capable of hurting others.
</P>
<P>
   Few are innocent of this ``lesser'' violence. Most -- but
certainly not all -- of us just don't pull triggers when we are
teed off. We seethe, gossip, demean, belittle and yell. We commit
acceptable acts of violence against fellow human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``Ethics for the New Millennium,'' the Dalai
Lama says violence is caused by our lack compassion, which he
describes as ``a feeling of intimacy toward all other sentient
beings, including, of course, those who would harm us.''
</P>
<P>
   Compassion is the foundation of most major world religions.
Biblical traditionsChristianity, Judaism, and Islamidentify
compassion as God's primary characteristic. God is Love and loving
others embodies the divine. Eastern religions link wisdom and
compassion to enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its universality, compassion is perhaps the most
difficult of all virtues. Our own failures to be compassionate --
we rarely love our neighbor as ourselves -- lie at the center of
all that shames us.
</P>
<P>
   We do not love as we should. So, we imagine wars in heaven. But
the main war is insidewhen we hate the guy who cuts in the grocery
store line.
</P>
<P>
   How to stop the violence? Gun control? Metal detectors? Mass
revivals?
</P>
<P>
   White Christians have much to learn from their Jewish,
African-American and homosexual neighbors. Sometimes people hate
because they hate. It does not make much sense. There have always
been and will always be Hitlers, slavery, gay-bashingand Eric
Harrises and Larry Ashbrooks.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of indiscriminate violence, weas individuals and in
communitiesmust practice compassion through personal integrity and
acceptance of others. Ending violence starts when we commit our own
hearts to peacemaking. Honest people know this spiritual battle is
within.

MANY OF THE BEST MYSTERY WRITERS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fans of mysteries and thrillers, fall is a joyous season
because so many of the genre's best writers are published in
September, October and November.
</P>
<P>
   September brings Elizabeth George, Robert B. Parker, Sara
Paretsky, Stephen King and Carl Hiaasen. Sue Grafton, Anne Perry
and Dick Francis get published in October. Then November brings
Martha Grimes, Edna Buchanan and Barry Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   George's latest mystery, ``In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner''
(Bantam, $25.95, 594 pages), again features Scotland Yard Inspector
Detective Thomas Lynley and his disgraced and quick-tempered
assistant, Barbara Havers.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Pursuit'' opens, Nicola Maiden has not returned from a
hiking trip in Derbyshire in time for a date with her boyfriend,
Julian Britton. Both her father, Andy, and Britton begin to search
the moors. Another hiker discovers the body of a young man in a
circle of stones known as the Nine Sisters Hedge. The hiker alerts
the police, who find Nicola's body nearby. A former officer in the
Yard's elite undercover unit, Maiden requests that his former
colleague Lynley help in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynley agrees to go to Derbyshire but insists that the recently
demoted Havers stay in London and do a computer search to check out
cases Maiden handled before he retired. As usual, Havers disobeys
and follows her hunches and traces Nicola's life in London as a
young law student. She also hunts for any ties between Nicola and
the murdered man.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always amazed that the very American George writes so very
British. She is an expert at delving into relationships, and in
``Pursuit'' she continues to humanize the very aristocratic and
newly married Lynley. His anger at Havers for disobeying an order
from another superior to save a child life's dominates his handling
of the murder investigation, adding an edge to a very fine mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Time'' by Sara Paretsky (Delacorte Press, $24.95, 385
pages).
</P>
<P>
   It's been five years since the last Paretsky mystery appeared
featuring Chicago private investigator V.I. Warshawski. Thankfully,
it's been worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chicago Herald Star is bought by multimedia giant
Global Entertainment, reporter Murray Ryerson _ Warshawski's friend
and ex-lover _ seems to be selling out by becoming host of a
television talk show. Nevertheless, Warshawski shows up at a party
to celebrate the new show. After the party, Warshawski is driving
her old pal Mary Louise Neely home when she spots a body in the
street and swerves to avoid it. When the police come, they take the
women's statements, have Warshawski do a Breathalyzer test and then
give them a ride home.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Warshawski is awakened by a call from her
downstairs neighbor saying two cops want to talk to her about a
hit-and-run-case. Detectives Pelgrave and Lemour say that they were
told she refused to take the Breathalyzer test and that no
statement had been filed at the station. When the woman in the road
dies during surgery, Warshawski is determined to find out who she
was and what really happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Warshawski learns the dead woman was an illegal immigrant named
Nicola Aguinaldo, who supported her two children and mother by
working as a mother's helper for the Robert Baladines in an
exclusive suburb. Aguinaldo had been accused of stealing a necklace
from the Baladines, convicted and imprisoned in an upstate women's
prison. Aguinaldo had escaped the night she died.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Baladine owns Chicago's biggest private investigation
firm and tries to get Warshawski to work for him. When she refuses,
things start to go really bad for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Time'' is a fast-paced look at the world of
conglomerates, corporate greed, police corruption and life in
prison. Warshawski has a sharp tongue, as do most of the characters
she meets. I haven't liked all the books in the Warshawski series,
but I'm glad to say ``Hard Time'' is great fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Honor'' by Robert B. Parker (G.P. Putnam's Sons,
$22.95, 336 pages).
</P>
<P>
   After 26 crime novels featuring Boston private investigator
Spenser, Parker has created a feisty new Bean Town P.I. _ Sunny
Randle, ex-cop, divorcee and aspiring artist. She's a 5-foot-6
beauty who weighs 115 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy couple hire Randle to find their 15-year-old daughter,
Millicent, who's been gone 10 days. After checking the hospitals
and shelters, Randle is convinced that Millicent must be working
the streets and contacts crime boss Tony Marcus to find out who
Millicent's pimp is.
</P>
<P>
   Told the teen is working for Pharoah Fox, Randle tracks down
Millicent and runs into Fox, who tries to pull a knife on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages of being a woman in this deal is that no
one takes you seriously, so they are careless. While his hand was
still in his pocket I took my gun out. I thumbed back the hammer as
the gun came out and put the muzzle up under his nose, maybe a
half-inch from his upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tell Millicent that she should go with me.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Like hell,' Fox said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm not a patient woman,' I said. `And I haven't shot my pimp
quota this week. Tell her. Now.'
</P>
<P>
   ```You can't just shoot me on the f...... street,' Pharoah said.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm a small blond cutie. You're a big ugly pimp. You'll be
dead. I'll say you assaulted me. Who's going to take your side?'''
</P>
<P>
   Millicent goes with Randle, who agrees not to take her home
until she's ready. When thugs try to kill them in Randle's loft, a
simple case becomes dangerous. Randle will have to use her wits and
her ex-husband's connections to the mob to keep herself and
Millicent alive.
</P>
<P>
   Parker wrote ``Family'' for actress Helen Hunt, who'll play
Sunny Randle next year in the film adaptation, which will have a
hard time matching Parker's fast-paced action and smart-mouthed
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Spenser will like Sunny Randle _ the two could be twins.

EMPLOYER SNOOPING IS LEGAL, AND THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT
IT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SURVEILLANCE-WHO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Brother is watching. And it's increasingly likely that the
Omniscient One is your boss.
</P>
<P>
   She might be recording the casual conversations between you and
a co-worker, or tracking e-mails on your company computer, or
watching the goings-on in the staff lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like an invasion of your privacy? Think again. Most
employee monitoring in the workplace is perfectly legal, and it
happens more than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of misunderstanding about it,'' says William
Hubbartt, a human resources management consultant in Illinois.
``People think, `I have my rights,' but I found out after doing my
research that, unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Employee, you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of U.S. businesses eavesdrop on their employees in
some fashion _ on the phone, via videotape and through e-mail and
Internet files _ according to a 1999 survey by the American
Management Association International.
</P>
<P>
   And that number continues to creep upward, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, monitoring equipment is increasingly cheaper and more
sophisticated. Employers can trace everything from deleted e-mails
and voice mails to the exact computer keys a worker strikes.
Special software can follow employees' paths across the Internet,
and high-tech employee badges even let bosses track their workers'
movement within an office building. Wireless video cameras are
small enough these days to fit in pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, more workers use technology that lends itself to
monitoring: e-mail, the Internet and voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good deal of this is done because it can be done, because
the technology allows it,'' says Eric Rolfe Greenberg, director of
management studies at the American Management Association
International. ``If, 10 years ago, a CEO had put out a dictate that
everything typed (on a typewriter) had to have a carbon and the
carbon had to be filed, it would have been unenforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's a cinch to trace computer files and digital
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers, for the most part, unless they are voyeurs, don't
set out to spy on their employees,'' says Hubbartt, author of ``The
New Battle Over Workplace Privacy.'' Most snooping ensues, he
suggests, only after an employer gets wind of an employee
transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses have lots of good reasons to monitor workers: to
deter workplace crime, to protect business secrets and to make
sure, for instance, that employees aren't calling Timbuktu on the
company dime.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses concerned about workplace violence often use video
surveillance for security purposes, and those worried about the
Internet sites that employees are surfing at work can buy software
that watches employees' screens.
</P>
<P>
   Not monitoring can sometimes cost companies a bunch. After
Chevron Corp. employees sent a sexually harassing e-mail through
the company system, Chevron was forced to pay four plaintiffs $2.2
million. Had the company been monitoring employees' e-mail, it
might have caught the problem before it went to court.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with monitoring is, ``It can go overboard,''
says Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in
San Diego. ``There are virtually no laws to protect employees from
the excesses of monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens and other critics of workplace monitoring say that abuses
of power run rampant, from employers videotaping workers in
lavatories and locker rooms to businesses that hire investigators
to follow workers home.
</P>
<P>
   Only one federal law addresses workplace privacy. The Electronic
Communications Privacy Act forbids employers to eavesdrop on phone
conversations and e-mail after it becomes clear that the content is
personal, says Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of ``Privacy
Journal.'' Only one state, Michigan, prohibits secret videotaping
of employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, the California Legislature became the first in the
nation to pass a workplace monitoring bill, prohibiting employers
from secretly monitoring employee e-mail and computer records. The
measure awaits the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, technology increases and the law does not
keep up,'' says Harriette Topitzes, the chief union steward for
airline reservationists at Trans World Airlines. That group
unionized in 1992, primarily as a way to protect members against
unreasonable monitoring. Now, the company must give a telephone
reservationist five-day notice before monitoring her calls.
</P>
<P>
   Spying on employees goes back to Henry Ford at the turn of the
century. The automobile magnate employed ``a bunch of goons,'' says
Smith, who tracked the off-hours behavior of Ford's assembly-line
workers. Drunkenness and adultery were grounds for firing.
</P>
<P>
   Modern workplace privacy concerns arose with the advent of
electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the mid- to late-'80s is that technology
became available, really to any size employer,'' says Cindia
Cameron, organizing director for 9 to 5, National Association of
Working Women. ``It crossed the line to monitoring people instead
of productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's technologies allow ``near ubiquitous monitoring'' if an
employer so chooses, Givens says. But there's a downside to that.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 University of Wisconsin study showed that monitored
workers have significantly higher rates of severe fatigue and
depression than nonmonitored workers.
</P>
<P>
   And probably a more adversarial relationship with management,
Givens says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way to create low morale than a
ubiquitous monitoring situation,'' she says. ``If you're being
monitored every hour of the day, there's really not a shred of
dignity you can take from your work situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most employers expect that workers will make the occasional
personal phone call or send a nonbusiness e-mail. But employees
ought to be fully aware of the ground rules, Hubbartt says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for the employer is, No. 1, to have a legitimate
reason for (monitoring), and define a policy in terms of what they
intend to do,'' he says. ``Then communicate that policy to
everyone, which minimizes the privacy expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't expect it,'' Hubbartt adds, ``then you're not as
upset not to have it.''

ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, `NEW' KREUTZ IS HOG _ AND BEEF _ HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKHART, Texas _ The old Kreutz Market was dark and ancient. It
was a smoky shrine to Texas barbecue, and worshippers came from all
corners of the state to fill themselves with the glorious products
of its pits.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Kreutz Market _ just blocks from the old _ is a
bright, shining cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The change was due to a family scrape that has been duly
chronicled. It was a brother-sister thing, and no one can expect a
brother and sister to get along forever.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't. Rick Schmidt, the brother, owned the business;
Nina Sells, the sister, owned the building. They split, and Schmidt
moved his business off the city square, several blocks north. It
opened this month.
</P>
<P>
   Texas barbecue lovers cringed, but Schmidt never wavered. Texas
Monthly had named Kreutz Market one of the top three barbecue
establishments in the state, and Schmidt knew he could continue
that regal position anywhere he took his pits.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to search out Kreutz anymore. The old place was
just a block off the town square, but hidden inside cavernous old
buildings that looked almost deserted from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The new place, right where U.S. 183 spills into town from
Austin, sits back on a colossal parking lot that welcomes any size
vehicle, including 18-wheelers and massive motor homes.
</P>
<P>
   The building is big and bright and rivals the Wal-Mart at the
other side of town for size.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but wonder how the deep-smoked taste of Kreutz
barbecue could be sustained in such pristine surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Until you open the door.
</P>
<P>
   There, just as in the old place, you are met full-face,
full-lung with heavy smoke. The courtyard just inside the
double-door entry is not air-conditioned, and the curling smoke
from all three pits freely wanders the building, pushed along by
slow ceiling fans.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke permeates your clothes, your hair, your psyche. You
are one with the barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   You can sit and eat in the courtyard, or patio _ whatever it is
called. Big, substantial tables and chairs are scattered around the
massive room.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, where the line forms in front of the butcher blocks,
workers slice away at nearly blackened shoulders of beef and rings
of shiny sausage. These are the same people who worked at the old
Kreutz, and they have developed a factory mentality.
</P>
<P>
   As the lids to the pits open and close with the help of pulleys
and chains, and the fire roars with the introduction of new air,
the workers look blankly at the customers and await the orders.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to be clever with these people. They have sliced
barbecue in their sleep. They haven't breathed a smokeless breath
in years. They have heard every funny line concerning barbecue, and
they don't find them funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You buy by the pound at Kreutz. Sausage, beef, pork chops.
</P>
<P>
   Your order is handed over on a piece of reddish-brown butcher
paper, and you are offered a choice of white bread or saltine
crackers. Please don't ask for sauce or beans or potato salad. They
don't have them, and you should have known that before getting in
line.
</P>
<P>
   There is no silverware either. One plastic knife is all you get,
and no one at the market is happy about that. In the old market, a
knife was chained to the table for everyone to use, but the health
department put a stop to that.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, people were stealing the knives for souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the old place, you can still get a few side orders _
tomatoes, avocados and quartered onions. Several drinks are
available; the most popular is Big Red. All of this is available
inside the dining room, which is air-conditioned and usually
crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he was going to keep things the same, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   The only question becomes: Is it still as good as it used to be?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a word: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   In what was more a publicity stunt than a culinary necessity,
Schmidt brought a shovel load of burning coals from his old market
to start the flames at the new. It was a nice touch, but didn't
ensure that the same taste would result.
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Kreutz Market is still the king. People line up just
like always, they tear the meat with their fingers just like
always, and suits and ties sit next to bluejeans and sweaty work
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt and his family have kept the faith, and their new
cathedral to Texas barbecue is still a blessed sanctuary of good
taste.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute
Recipe takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast and
Fresh.  THE WORKING COOK: Exotic Shrimp Vie With Mom's Noodles  
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Pork chops. Egg noodles. Weren't those things that
Mom used to make with the help of a can of cream of mushroom soup?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, if your mother did make them, it's probably because egg
noodles cook quickly, as do pork chops. In fact, pork chops taste
best when they're not cooked too well-done, even though many of us
have grown used to eating them somewhat dried out.
</P>
<P>
   Wide egg noodles _ that yellow pasta that you will have
absolutely no luck cooking  &LR; al dente &LR;  _ are delightful in this
week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, accompanying juicy pork chops glazed in
a rich, easy-to-make pan sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As the noodles cook, you can quickly pan-fry the pork chops,
then deglaze the pan with a shot of brandy. Orange marmalade and
butter complete the sauce. The bittersweet flavors of marmalade and
brandy bring out the sweetness of the pork, while the buttered
noodles taste just like home.
</P>
<P>
   The two other recipes, on the other hand, will take you far from
childhood memories of mainstream American food. Shellfish in Spicy
Saffron Broth with Israeli Couscous is inspired by the flavors of a
Moroccan tagine, a slow-cooked stew ripe with fragrant spices. In
this 30-Minute Main Dish recipe, the shellfish and spices cook
quickly yet make a surprisingly rich broth _ perfect for the
wheaty, spongy Israeli couscous to soak up.
</P>
<P>
   The Now &AMP; Later recipe, Curried Lamb and Eggplant Stew, has many
of the same spices but carries them over to India. Coconut milk and
chutney soften the heat, and eggplant, potato and tomato give
layers of texture to the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb works wonders in a stew, its heady flavor permeating the
densely fragrant sauce. However, you can easily substitute beef
stew meat, which often is paired with eggplant and potatoes in
curries.
</P>
<P>
   Both recipes are pleasantly spicy, but if you prefer more of a
kick, simply increase the cayenne to suit your taste. Another way
to intensify flavor is to use whole spices and toast them in a
heavy skillet until their fragrance is released, then grind them
fresh either in a spice grinder, or in an electric coffee grinder,
which has been used only for spices.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
SAFE PORK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Trichinosis scares in the past have caused many people to overcook
their pork, but today the disease is extremely rare due to improved
sanitation standards. Pork dries up when overcooked, so there's a
delicate balance between safety and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid worries about trichinosis, cook the chops to a minimum
internal temperature of 137 degrees. This will result in well-done
meat. (The temperature of the chops will rise 10 to 15 degrees
while they sit.)

   ORANGE-GLAZED PORK CHOPS WITH BUTTERED NOODLES
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces wide egg noodles
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter, in 1-tablespoon slices
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless pork chops, 1-inch thick, 6 to 8 ounces each (see
note)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons brandy (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons orange marmalade
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning preparation, start a large pot of salted water
to boil.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the water boils, cook the noodles on medium-high heat
according to package directions. After draining them, stir in 2
tablespoons of the butter. Season with salt and pepper and keep
warm.
</P>
<P>
   While the noodles are cooking, season the pork chops on both
sides with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Warm a nonstick skillet (large enough to fit all 4 chops snugly)
until quite hot over medium-high heat. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in
the pan. Add the chops to the pan, and cook until browned, about 2
minutes for medium (see note) or 21/2 minutes for well-done. As
they cook, press down firmly on the chops once or twice with a
spatula for more even browning.
</P>
<P>
   Flip the chops over and cook them on the other side, about 1
minute for medium, 11/2 minutes for well-done. Transfer the chops
to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Take the pan off the heat for a few moments to allow it to cool
slightly. Add a spoonful of brandy; if it evaporates immediately
the pan is still too hot. Return the pan to medium heat and add the
rest of the brandy. Allow the alcohol to cook off until it has
reduced halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the marmalade until it melts. The glaze should have a
tamlike consistency at this point. Stir in the remaining
tablespoon butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chops and their accumulated juices to the pan, and
cook on both sides until they are heated through and coated with
the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the chops on the noodles and drizzle with the remaining
glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes: &LR;  Pork chops vary in size. If you purchase the smaller
center-cut chops, which are sometimes only 4 ounces each, serve 2
chops per person. If you find pork chops larger than 1-inch thick,
cooking time will be a few minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter orange of the marmalade and the sweetness of the pork
are complemented well by brandy. Substituting Cognac is a special
treat, and even bourbon is a nice substitution _ or experiment with
other liquors.

<P>
   SHELLFISH IN SPICY SAFFRON BROTH WITH ISRAELI COUSCOUS
</P>
<P>
   This recipe also works extremely well using mussels. However,
mussels take longer to prepare than shrimp since they need to be
debearded. If you do opt for mussels, scrub off any barnacles with
a wire scrubber. Then use needle-nose pliers to pull off the fuzzy
beards attached inside the shell.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds peeled and deveined medium shrimp
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Israeli couscous (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch saffron
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken broth or stock
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced cilantro (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Start bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the shrimp in the coriander, cumin, cayenne pepper and
paprika; set aside to marinate at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan; add the onion and saute
for a few minutes, until tender, then add the garlic and saute for
another minute.
</P>
<P>
   While the onion sautes, begin cooking the couscous in the
boiling water according to package directions, just until al dente.
Take a few tablespoons of the boiling water and add it to the
saffron in a separate container.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the shrimp into the onion mixture and cook for 2 to 3
minutes over medium-high heat, until the shrimp just turn pink. Add
the stock and saffron and quickly bring to a boil. (If using
mussels, add them now and cook them until their shells open.) Take
care not to overcook the shrimp or they will become tough.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon couscous into shallow bowls and ladle the stew over each
serving. Be sure to include plenty of the saffron broth. Garnish
with cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Israeli couscous is available at upscale supermarkets.
If you can't find it, substitute with orzo pasta or instant
couscous.

   CURRIED LAMB &AMP; EGGPLANT STEW
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   31/2 to 4 pounds boneless lamb stew meat, cut into 3/4-inch
cubes
</P>
<P>
   3 onions, cut in medium dice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced + 1 large russet
potato, cut into eighths
</P>
<P>
   1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup tamarind chutney, or fruit chutney
</P>
<P>
   1 pound thin Japanese eggplants, trimmed, cut in half, then into
1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   5 Roma tomatoes, cut in eighths
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large, heavy stock pot over medium-high heat until quite
hot. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the oil, making sure the bottom of
the pan is completely covered in oil. When the oil is almost
smoking, add some of the lamb cubes, being careful not to crowd the
pan. Saute undisturbed for 2 minutes, then turn once and brown the
other side. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon. Repeat with
the remaining meat. You will probably have to brown the meat in 4
batches. Add additional oil if the pan becomes dry.
</P>
<P>
   When all the lamb is cooked, add the onions, coriander, cumin,
black pepper, turmeric, cardamom and cayenne to the pan and saute
until the onions are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic
and ginger and saute another 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the pan with the broth. Return the lamb to the pot. Add
the 2 diced potatoes, the coconut milk and chutney. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer until the lamb begins to get tender,
about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the eggplant, tomatoes and the remaining potato. Continue
cooking until the lamb is completely tender and the potato is
cooked through, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with cilantro and serve with basmati rice.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Vegetable Soup's On In 30 Minutes or Less  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Even though soup is one of the easiest dishes to
make, many beginners shy away from attempting it because of the
time involved.
<P>
   It's true that soups are traditionally long-simmered affairs,
taking much of the day to cook. However, most of that time the soup
just perks along on its own, needing only a glance and a stir now
and then to make sure all is well.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are other soups that are less intimidating for
beginners because they use commercial broth _ and that means they
take just minutes, instead of hours, to cook. And they are full of
fresh-from-the-stove flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Try today's recipe for Simple Vegetable Soup and you'll see what
I mean. It uses the best of the harvest season _ green beans,
zucchini, spinach and tomatoes, along with year-round aromatic
vegetables like onions, carrots and celery. And it can be done in
less than a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   If you want things to move along even more quickly, buy the
prewashed spinach leaves that come in packages. Then you won't even
have stems to remove.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SIMPLE VEGETABLE SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Make this soup the first time just as the recipe reads. Then try
using parsnips and/or turnips and/or leeks or whatever. As long as
you chop the pieces of vegetable small, the soup will still cook in
20 minutes. From ``Learning to Cook with Marion Cunningham,''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1 handful of green beans
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch spinach (about 2 cups leaves)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken broth or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Vegetables:  &LR; Peel and finely chop the onion. Peel
the carrots; cut off and discard 1/4 inch of the rounded stem end.
Cut the carrots in half lengthwise, then cut into slices 1/4 inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off and discard about 1/2 inch from the root end of the
celery stalks. Cut the stalks in half lengthwise, then slice the
stalks into 1/4-inch slices.
</P>
<P>
   Core and chop the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off and discard about 1/4 inch from each end of the
zucchini, cut them in half lengthwise, and slice crosswise into
1/4-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the pointy tips and ends of the green beans and cut them
crosswise into 1-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the spinach. Tear off and discard the stems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Soup:  &LR; Melt the butter in a medium-sized pot over
medium heat, then add the onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring
often, for about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broth (or water) and tomatoes, and simmer for another 10
minutes. Stir in the zucchini and beans and cook for 2 minutes.
</P>

 COOK'S KITCHENS: Bay Wolf Founder Aims for Heart of the Home   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 BERKELEY, Calif. _  One restaurant kitchen is enough for Michael
Wild. So when the founder/owner of one of Oakland's oldest
destination restaurants, Bay Wolf, remodeled the kitchen of his
comfortable old house in Berkeley's Elmwood district, the last
thing he wanted was a replica of his work kitchen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no wood-burning pizza oven, no acres of stainless steel
and marble, no state-of-the-art espresso maker, no super-fast
dishwasher, no spigots that swing over the stove _ none of the
bells and whistles many food professionals covet for their home
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   What Wild wanted was a kitchen that would be the heart of the
home, a place where he could read or ruminate as well as cook, and
where family and friends could linger at a spacious table over a
cup of coffee or a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, he wanted a compact, streamlined work area in
a room full of light with a view of the outdoor trees, shrubs and
flowers. That last aspect _ designing the space to incorporate a
pretty neighboring yard into the interior _ duplicates what Wild
calls, ``the Japanese idea of borrowing a garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild and his wife, Jill, a private-label wine seller, managed to
fulfill their wish list. With light streaming in from three sides,
their medium-sized kitchen sports a large window over the sink,
affording a charming view of the well-tended next-door garden. And
a conveniently placed door makes the rear deck seem like an
extension of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A commodious wooden table, built by one of Wild's adult sons
from a previous marriage, comfortably accommodates eight people _
the Wilds' favorite number for entertaining _ but most of all is
the anchor point for the family's times together.
</P>
<P>
   Michael does most of the cooking at home. Jill is no slouch in
the kitchen, but the couple never cooks together. ``I'm too
territorial in the kitchen,'' Michael says with a laugh. ``I prefer
not having anybody help me.'' When he cooks, he doesn't even like
the distraction of music. ``I get things done fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The European-born Wild comes by his appreciation of fine food
naturally. While some American families foster togetherness by
activities like camping or playing touch football, Wild's family
bonded at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Two uncles, noted gourmets, took the young boy to restaurants in
his hometown of Paris with the aim of familiarizing him with
certain specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Wild and his parents came to the United States after World War
II and settled in Southern California. He recalls his mother
cooking extra food at dinner so her son would have a substantial
midday meal the next day while she was at work. Sandwiches, in her
opinion, were not something you ate at home.
</P>
<P>
   Wild's culinary education continued with trips to France and by
the time he was a comparative literature student at San Francisco
State, he was cooking increasingly sophisticated meals for friends.
But his love of food did not translate into a career until after a
decade teaching at SFSU when he and friend Larry Goldman opened Bay
Wolf in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Berkeley's political Cheese Board collective, they
envisioned their venture as a cheese store/cafe collective, with
Wild behind the stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were naive, arrogant and stupid,'' Wild says with an
engaging grin. But where other starry-eyed and often politically
motivated new restaurateurs ran aground, Bay Wolf weathered the
choppy waters of its early years and evolved into the critically
acclaimed lunch and dinner venue it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Used to academic discipline, Wild began rigorously studying
everything related to food and wine to augment his talents.
</P>
<P>
   Another culinary trip to Southern France, partly with Berkeley
wine merchant/importer Kermit Lynch, proved ``a revelation. We went
to restaurants and markets like you go to museums and cathedrals.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as his professional vision focused, Wild knew exactly where
he was going when he began the kitchen remodel in the house he
bought in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The room originally was what he laughingly describes as ``an old
hippie kitchen, with lots of redwood and hanging things _ totally
uncleanable.'' Though not an obsessive neatnik, Wild wanted things
uncluttered and easily cleanable. He covered the floor in
Marmoleum, a modern version of linoleum that's a breeze to clean
and never discolors. The counters are topped with fossil-embedded
German stone that's equally low-maintenance. Wall paint, in a
soothing butterscotch tone with red and purple accents, was
selected to be totally washable.
</P>
<P>
   The remodeled kitchen has an adequate but not state-of-the-art
refrigerator and an efficient range _ a high-end Wolf brand, but
with a modest four burners rather than the ``behemoth ranges'' of
up to 10 burners some chefs favor. The dishwasher is a Bosch,
probably the fanciest appliance in the place, Wild says. But he
likes its efficiency and the fact that it's extremely quiet. ``I
cannot stand that awful noise some of these machines make,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is also one of the reasons Wild does chores like chopping,
mixing and kneading by hand rather than machine. A Cuisinart is
stashed away in a cabinet, along with an ancient _ ``I think it's
from the '40s'' _ KitchenAid. ``My wife uses it when she bakes,''
he notes.
</P>
<P>
   That KitchenAid escaped the Wilds' scrupulous weeding-out when
they stocked their redone kitchen. ``We looked at every utensil and
gadget, and if we hadn't used it in the past year _ out!''
</P>
<P>
   There is a notable exception to Wild's disdain of newfangled
gadgetry. He loves his DeLonghi toaster oven _ ``I bought it for
$99 dollars at the old Whole Earth Access'' _ which he uses not
just for toasting or reheating but for actual cooking. Any time he
fixes dinner for four or fewer people, Wild cooks at least one dish
in the energy-efficient toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   There is one exception to Wild's predeliction for cooking alone.
Three-year-old David Wild can cook with Dad to his heart's content.
He has his own pint-sized work station with real utensils, not
toys, scaled to his small hands. Making whipped cream for Dad's
desserts is one of his specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Does Wild the elder hope that Wild the younger will follow in
his footsteps as a chef? ``I have no idea. Incidentally, I have
never called myself a chef,'' says the man who was, in fact, the
working chef of Bay Wolf for the restaurant's first 12 years. ``I'm
just a cook.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
A typical informal dinner at the Berkeley home of Michael and Jill
Wild might feature these dishes:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Starters: &LR;  Nuts, olives, goat cheese crostini, radishes
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Wine: &LR;  an Oregon Pinot Gris or a Spanish Godeval
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Entree: &LR;  Dry-cured grilled tri-tip served with an autumn
vegetable ragout
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Wine: &LR;  Scherrer Alexander Valley Zinfandel or Qupe Syrah
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Dessert: &LR;  Assorted berries and fresh figs with whipped cream
flavored with vanilla and/or rum, accompanied by almond macaroons
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T &QL; 
 &QL; 
Restaurateur Michael Wild is very happy with the kitchen in the
one-story old Berkeley home he shares with his wife, Jill, and
their 3-year-old son, David.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT THEY LIKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _Lots of natural light comes in from windows and doors on three
sides.
</P>
<P>
   _The windows and a door opening onto a spacious deck ties
indoors and outdoors together.
</P>
<P>
   _The appliances are not oversized, but an extra sink in the
pantry and a second refrigerator in the basement help when the
couple entertains a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   _Walls, counters and floors are easy to clean, meeting the
Wilds' goal of creating a child-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT THEY MIGHT CHANGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _Adding a garbage disposal in the pantry sink.
</P>
<P>
   _Creating a bigger work space on the counter between sink and
stove. ``I like to stand in one place,'' Wild says.
</P>
<P>
   _Eventually, David will outgrow his little work table, which
will necessitate a small remodel.

 COOK'S BOOKS: S.F. Pros Collaborate for Junior League   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Remember those charming down-home recipe
collections published in the days of stay-at-home moms to raise
funds for the PTA, a church group or a hospital auxiliary?
<P>
   Well, forget those books. The San Francisco Junior League's new
cookbook, ``San Francisco Flavors,'' may technically fall into the
category we used to call _ somewhat snobbishly _ do-gooder books,
i.e., books whose proceeds serve worthy causes, but it's a far cry
from those loving-hands-at-home books of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Professionally published, illustrated with line drawings and
styled color photographs, this hard-cover volume features
professional-quality recipes that have been tested and are
presented in a consistent style and format.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Bay Area's best-known chefs consulted on the book _
Hubert Keller, Thomas Keller, Michael Mina, Reed Hearon, Gerald
Hirigoyen, Maria Helm, Darcy Tizio and Arnold Wong, plus master
baker Flo Braker.
</P>
<P>
   Their tips accompany many recipes and enliven the book. A
favorite comes from Thomas Keller: ``When I lived in Italy, a
charming Italian woman taught me to make fresh pasta dough. One of
the best tips she gave me was a test for knowing when the dough has
been kneaded enough (over-kneading causes tough pasta): When the
pasta feels like your earlobe, it's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine mavens Kris Harriman, sommelier for the PlumpJack
enterprises; David Pauley of London Wine Bar; and Debbie Zachareas
of EOS contributed suggestions for wines to match dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for hoary if beloved San Francisco standbys like
oyster loaf, Green Goddess dressing or Joe's Special. This book's
recipes _ many inspired by the Bay Area's cutting-edge restaurants
_ mirror the latest food trends. Fusion dishes abound; many recipes
reflect the interest in food that packs maximum flavor without
mega-calories; and throughout there is an emphasis on fresh,
locally produced food.
</P>
<P>
   Cioppino is the only San Francisco recipe we found virtually
unchanged from classic versions. Other familiar dishes are given a
decided 1990s uptick. Pumpkin cheesecake has a gingersnap crust
updated with crystallized ginger and hazelnuts; eggs Benedict are
nestled on a pancetta waffle and garnished with fresh asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the strongest chapters deal with side dishes, many of
which can be transformed into vegetarian entrees, and brunch, which
yields fine ideas for quick dishes that would also make nice
suppers.
</P>
<P>
   The list of dishes we tried and liked _ or intend to try soon _
goes on: pancetta-wrapped scallops and papaya, strawberry soup with
balsamic vinegar, Chinatown-inspired salmon in black bean sauce,
cornmeal pancakes with chevre and red pepper sauce, rose geranium
pound cake and Meyer lemon cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Like its homey antecedents, this book has an ulterior purpose:
All money raised goes to the Junior League's community projects.
Charity should always taste so good.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Fringale Chef Recalls Homeland, With Love   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Perhaps one of the least explored European regions
is the Basque area that straddles France and Spain along the Bay of
Biscay. But Gerald Hirigoyen and his wife, Cameron, have brought
the food of Gerald's homeland to America with ``The Basque Kitchen:
Tempting Food from the Pyrenees.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hirigoyen, who is also the chef-owner of Fringale and Pastis in
San Francisco, gives a loving recount of his memories of growing up
and learning about food in the region. He explains the history,
including the change of control of both the French and Spanish
sides of the area, but he concentrates primarily on the food.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hirigoyen, Basque people enjoy rustic cooking in
the best sense of the term. Food is simply prepared, allowing the
ingredients to star. His recipes use many of the same ingredients _
a variety of peppers as well as tomatoes and potatoes _ to create a
backdrop for fish or lamb.
</P>
<P>
   The food sounds appealing in its simplicity: Potato and White
Bean Soup with Olive Puree, Prawns a la Pancha, Halibut Cheeks with
Garlic and Parsley, and Lamb Stew with Mixed Nut Pesto. A few
dishes get updated with upscale additions like Garbanzo Bean Soup
with Spinach and Foie Gras and Tomato Gazpacho with Lobster.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the dishes are quite easy to prepare. The Potato and
White Bean Soup, for example, takes only a few minutes to assemble
and begin cooking. It's then finished by pureeing it to a smooth
consistency and topped by an olive puree garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many chef's books, ``The Basque Kitchen'' does not
require flipping back and forth for all of the components required
to make a recipe. Frequently the longest part of the recipe is the
head note, which explains where Hirigoyen first had the dish or
where he got his inspiration to create it.
</P>
<P>
   Hirigoyen is fiercely loyal to the ingredients of the region,
sometimes to a point that makes recreating the dishes difficult.
Many of the recipes call for small amounts of  &LR; piment &LR; 
 &LR; d'esplette &LR; , a small red pepper that is dried then roasted and
ground. He grudgingly writes, ``You can substitute sweet paprika or
mild chili  &LR; (sic) &LR;  powder but neither will give the delicate
complexity of this spice.'' He does, at least, give a mail order
source for obtaining the chile powder.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the book is not geared to beginning cooks. Instructions
can be vague, like not specifying how to roll fish or chicken
around a filling, and recipes frequently lack visual clues to go
with cooking times. Near the end of the Piperade recipe, cooks are
supposed to ``stir until the eggs are set and all the ingredients
have blended.'' But the next instruction is to cook for 5 minutes
longer, with no indication as to how the final dish should look.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced cooks and those who just like to read cookbooks
will find ``The Basque Kitchen'' an interesting exploration of a
lovely region rich with culinary history.

 &LR; LAMB STEW WITH MIXED NUT PESTO
</P>
<P>
   The nut pesto whisked into the reduced cooking liquid along with
butter creates a unique and delicious sauce for this simple stew.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 medium leek, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   4 cups veal stock or canned low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup hazelnuts
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup walnuts
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup almonds
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed
saucepan over high heat. Working in two batches, add the lamb and
saute until it begins to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the
meat to a colander using a slotted spoon. Repeat with 2 more
tablespoons of olive oil and the remaining lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Add the leek, onion, carrot and remaining 2 tablespoons olive
oil; saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Return the meat to the pan. Add the
veal stock, salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is
cooked through and very tender, about 50 minutes. Occasionally skim
the top to remove any fat.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mortar and pestle, grind the garlic, hazelnuts, walnuts,
almonds and extra virgin olive oil into a chunky paste.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the cooking liquid from the lamb into a small saucepan.
Transfer the meat to a deep serving platter and cover with aluminum
foil to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cooking liquid over high heat and cook until reduced
by half, occasionally skimming the surface. Add the nut pesto and
return to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Swirl
in the butter. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sauce over the lamb and garnish with parsley.

 CRUSH '99: Wiley Weather Stumps Grape Harvesters   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For North Coast producers of sparkling wine and
Sauvignon Blanc, the annual grape crush is finally under way,
albeit fitfully. Thanks to weather that has seesawed between hot
and downright chilly, winemakers say their predictive skills are
getting a workout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking we're going to finish by the end of the week
and then it cools off,'' says Kristin Belair, winemaker at
Rutherford's Honig Vineyard and Winery, where the grapes have been
coming in since August 26.
</P>
<P>
   Determining whether grapes will be ripe tomorrow, next week or
two weeks from now is more difficult when the weather is variable.
For one thing, temperature extremes make it hard to do accurate
sugar sampling, one of the vineyard tests winemakers use to decide
when to pick. ``This is the second year in a row I thought my
refractometer was wrong,'' says Belair.

   At Gloria Ferrer, vineyard manager Mike Crumley says the winery
picked two days' worth of Pinot Noir for sparkling wine, then
decided to stop and wait for acid levels to drop. The
higher-than-expected acidity is due to the cool growing season, he
says. To get the acid level his winemaker wants, he'll pick the
grapes slightly riper than normal.

 &LR;  Both Crumley and Belair agree that grape quality is high, the
upside of the long, cool summer. The rain that pelted the Bay Area
recently left their vineyards virtually untouched. But yields this
year aren't what winery owners might want.
</P>
<P>
   Crumley says Gloria Ferrer's Pinot Noir crop is normal but the
Chardonnay is short. At Honig the crop is down 30 percent overall,
says Belair, and more in some vineyards. One property that yielded
30 tons last year produced only 12 tons this year. For
price-sensitive wine drinkers, that can't be good news.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: The Apple of a Brandy-Lover's Eye  
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Wherever apple orchards thrive and grape vineyards
struggle, you're likely to find some production of apple brandy.
Americans have distilled an apple brandy called Applejack since
Colonial times, and apple brandy is widely made in Europe. But the
most famous of all is Calvados from Normandy, France.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Calvados has been produced in Normandy and Brittany
since the 16th century, it is not as well known as Cognac and
Armagnac, the two premier French grape brandies. For Calvados
aficionados, the complex flavors of distilled apple juice aged in
French oak is superior to any grape brandy.
</P>
<P>
   The French appellation system designates three categories of
Calvados, with Pays d'Auge, the heart of Normandy, being the best.
Surrounding the Pays d'Auge are 10 other regions that produce apple
brandy, usually labeled simply as Calvados. Outside that region is
a more general appellation producing a product called eau-de-vie de
cidre.
</P>
<P>
   Calvados du Pays d'Auge is produced in a similar manner to
Cognac _ double distilled in pot stills, then aged in Limousin oak
barrels from three to 10 years before being blended and bottled.
Pays d'Auge Calvados is distilled in small stills and aged for
shorter periods in large oak casks.
</P>
<P>
   The Coeur de Lion estate in the Pays d'Auge dates back to the
early 17th century. Today, it's owned by Christian Drouin and is
part of an old stud farm on the road from Pont L'Ev &LR; e &LR; que to
Deauville-Trouville.
</P>
<P>
   The estate has two pot stills and a traditional Norman orchard.
To obtain juice with the correct balance of sweetness, acidity and
tannins, Coeur de Lion uses more than 20 varieties of apples, with
such exotic names as Red Duret for sweetness, Joly for bittersweet,
Moulins-a-Vent for bitter and Rambault for acid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to appellations, Calvados is labeled according to
age. Vieux (old) is the youngest at about 3 years, followed by
V.O., at least 4 years of age. V.S.O.P. and H &LR; o &LR; rs d'Age are 5
years old or more. There are also vintage-aged Calvados, many of
which are now finished in sherry and port casks.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tasted four vintaged Calvados Pays d'Auge from Coeur
de Lion. They are not inexpensive, but they are unique.
</P>
<P>
   Among my favorites are Coeur de Lion Calvados 1977 ($75), with
the smell and taste of ripe spiced apples and a lovely sweet fruity
finish from sherry cask aging. Calvados 1973 ($75) is more complex,
with vanilla and cooked-apple accents and great length. Calvados
1968 ($125) is the most elegant, with layers of flavor and a rich
texture.
</P>
<P>
   Coeur de Lion Calvados are available in many Bay Area
restaurants and fine wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   Larger Calvados distillers include Busnel and Boulard, the
latter with Pays d'Auge Grand Solage XO and Millesime.
</P>
<P>
   For a fresh taste of Normandy at a good price, look for
Christian Drouin Pomme du Jour Cidre de Normandie for $7.99. The
delicious, slightly sweet, Red Delicious apple aromas and flavors
are lifted by a refreshing palate-cleansing spritz.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Wine Basics
</P>
<P>
   The puckering astringency you feel in your mouth when drinking
red wine is from tannin. It is sensation similar to sipping strong
black tea.
</P>
<P>
   Tannins come from grape stems, seeds and skins as well as wood
tannins from aging the wine in oak barrels. New barrels give off
harsher tannins, while aging in used barrels provides a more mellow
effect. Red wines have about five times more tannin than white
wines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
St. Clement is Sold
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eye-pleasing sights in the Napa Valley is the
yellow 1878 Victorian-style Rosenbaum House at St. Clement
Vineyards, high above Highway 29, north of St. Helena. Founded in
1975 by San Francisco eye surgeon William Casey, St. Clement has
been owned since 1987 by the Japanese brewer Sapporo.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Beringer Wine Estates purchased the St. Clement stone
winery, the Rosenbaum House (now the winery's hospitality center)
and vineyards in Carneros for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   St. Clement produces excellent Napa Valley Chardonnay, Cabernet
Sauvignon and Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   So That's What You Call It
</P>
<P>
   In the Fall, 1999 issue of the Ojai Vineyard winery newsletter,
owner-winemaker Adam Tolmach talks about the ``International
Style'' of winemaking, meaning ``big fruited, immediately
accessible, oaky-as-hell, larger-than-life-wines.'' He also calls
these wines ``hedonistic fruit bombs.'' I couldn't have said it
better myself.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Classics Draw Customers to Medlyn's   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 DANVILLE, Calif. _  Don't even try to order a double latte at Vally
Medlyn's Coffee Shop and Soda Fountain. If that's what you want,
says owner Jeannie Pizzagoni with a neighborly smile, head a few
doors down Hartz Avenue to Starbucks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing double at Vally Medlyn's are the double deckers,
sturdy club sandwiches accompanied by a salad or chips (fries, 95
cents extra). The sandwiches feature combinations such as a classic
BLT, with turkey added for good measure; turkey; roast beef;
lettuce, tomato and red onion; or grilled ham and cheese with
deviled egg and lettuce. These meal-sized sandwiches, mostly priced
at $6.45, are numbered from one to 19, though there is no 13.
``We're superstitious,'' the menu explains.
</P>
<P>
   Vally Medlyn's obviously caters to pre-Blackhawk Danville
tastes. It's easy to discern who is an old-timer and who is a
newcomer: Only the latter think the name, Vally Medlyn, is a case
of faulty spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the local scene know that the Vally part has
nothing to do with the San Ramon Valley, but was the nickname of
founder Valentino Medlyn, who set up shop in Oakland's Grand Lake
district in 1935. When 1950s freeway construction swept his and
many other small businesses off the Oakland map, he relocated to
Danville _ name, menu and attitude intact.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzagoni's association with the shop goes way back, too. Medlyn
hired her as a waitress when she was 17. ``He treated me like a
daughter,'' she says, even after she went on to other restaurant
work at 21 and later became a medical receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   There were several owners after Medlyn's death in the mid-'70s,
and when the shop was once again for sale nearly eight years ago,
Pizzagoni and her husband, Bob, who owns a barber shop in Walnut
Creek, decided to take the plunge. ``If I had known all the things
this (owning a restaurant) involves . . .,'' Pizzagoni says, eyes
turned skyward.
</P>
<P>
   But despite frustrations caused by calamities such as a leaking
roof and problems with the soda fountain freezer _ ``In this heat,
we sell milk shakes nonstop; how are we going to make them if we
have to run to the back for every scoop of ice cream?'' _ she loves
her work and her customers, most of whom she knows by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Jan,'' she says, introducing a sprightly septuagenarian
perched on a dark green stool at the red Formica counter in front
of the soda fountain. The wall behind is decorated with a retro
zigzag-plus-palm trees design.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Neill eats lunch here daily since she retired from teaching
English and Spanish at San Ramon High. ``They tell me I was their
first customer back in '50,'' Neill laughs. ``I'm not sure that's
true, but I have certainly been coming here since the '50s.'' It's
hard to beat Medlyn's good food and reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   To regulars like Neill, Medlyn's is a constant in a
fast-changing community, a bastion of ``plain old American food,''
as Pizzagoni calls it _ crispy hash browns, fluffy waffles with
lots of butter and syrup, moist minced ham and scrambled eggs,
creamy milk shakes and fountain sodas, cottage cheese salad piled
high with fruit or tomato and cucumber, 10 kinds of burgers, and
house-made Texas-style chili heaped with grated cheese and onions.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Kist-Wich, which goes all the way back to
1935 _ franks quartered lengthwise, then grilled and placed on
mayo-slathered grilled bread with mustard, relish, lettuce and
potato salad. The late Vally Medlyn had it copyrighted.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.   TASTER'S CHOICE: Move Over, Rice Cakes, Here Comes Popcorn 
 &HT;       
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Rice cakes have been a dieter's dream for
low-calorie snacking for years. Many who aren't weight-conscious
also use the crisp snacks as a base for toppers like peanut butter
and jelly.
<P>
   So it's no surprise that their makers started coming out with
new flavors to keep boosting sales. One of the most popular in the
genre is butter-flavored popcorn cakes made either in part or
entirely of corn in the same process as rice cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted four different butter-flavored popcorn
cakes, and they overwhelmingly agreed on a favorite. The biggest
complaint about the rest of the category was the unappealing
texture, which ranged from tough to chewy.
</P>
<P>
   First place went to  &UR; Hain Organic Mini Cakes &LR;  (3.6 ounces, $1.89
at many supermarkets). Four panelists particularly liked the
noticeable popcorn flavor. Others thought the texture of this cake
was superior to the other brands. However, two panelists were put
off by the chemical taste of the butter flavor. One would buy it,
and four might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped significantly after first place, but next in line
was  &UR; Safeway &LR;  (5 ounces, $2.29 at Safeway). Two panelists thought
the cake had a nice crunch and was well balanced with salty and
butter flavors. But others found the texture slightly stale. One
panelist described it as quite salty, but another thought it was
too bland. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quaker &LR;  (4.5 ounces, $2.39 at Safeway) came in third. Three
panelists compared the texture to Styrofoam, but one thought this
brand had the best texture of all the cakes. One panelist liked the
butter flavor of this cake better than others; another described it
as bland. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Orville Redenbacher's &LR;  (4.2 ounces, $1.99
at Andronico's), which scored only two points lower than Quaker.
Three panelists commented on the appearance, which they described
as looking ``extruded'' and ``extracted'' instead of like bits of
puffed popcorn. Two panelists liked the corn flavor, but two others
thought the cake lacked any perceivable popcorn flavor. Two might
buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, assistant culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Roland
Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind. &QL;

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Cooking Steak  
   
 By Stephen Baker  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Most meat eaters love a good juicy steak but what
is the best way to cook a steak indoors, after barbecuing season
has passed? We set out to find which methods of cooking and
seasoning gave the best results.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We limited the seasoning to salt and black pepper which we added
at different points. Using the same amount, we seasoned six-ounce
New York steaks three ways _ an hour before cooking, at the start
of cooking and at the end of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   We also cooked the steaks three ways _ one completely in a
skillet on the stovetop, one seared on the stovetop then finished
in the oven, and the third one broiled. We cooked all the steaks to
medium-rare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   Food staffers preferred the pan-fried steak that had been
seasoned one hour before cooking. It had a crisp, caramelized
surface _ the classic steak look _ and was tender and juicy. While
prevailing wisdom says salting meat ahead of cooking draws out too
much moisture, we didn't find that to be the case with these
steaks.
</P>
<P>
   The steak that was first seared and then finished in a
425-degree oven was a close second but the texture wasn't quite as
good. The broiled steak was a distant third. It was tough and
rubbery, and didn't look as appealing.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AN ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Seasoning the steak just prior to cooking doesn't let the flavor
penetrate the beef as much as when it is salted an hour ahead, but
still results in good flavor. If you forget to salt the steak
ahead, it's better to salt it just before cooking rather than
waiting until afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The steak that was seasoned at the end of cooking was the least
preferred. The salt tasted sharp and was not well integrated with
the beef flavor. The lone Food staffer who liked it best admitted
that she prefers the bite of just-sprinkled salt on meat.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: The Topping's the Thing in Apple Dessert   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Everyone who's tried Kerry Heffernan's Apple Crisp
says it's the best they've tasted. The secret is in the topping.
There's twice as much as just about any recipe I've encountered.
And why not? Isn't that what people really love?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The topping is made with flour, oats and lots of butter, with a
judicious amount of sweet spices. The filling is plump with Granny
Smith apples, lending a firm texture and tart taste.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of baking, the crisp emerges from the oven
browned, bubbling and absolutely delicious. Serve it warm with a
scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.
</P>
<P>
   The apple crisp is one of the most popular choices at Oakland's
Autumn Moon Cafe, owned by Heffernan and Wendy Levy. They have
created a charming space that is loosely based on a movie theme,
with classic posters and photos all around the various dining
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The food celebrates American classics like grilled skirt steak
with onion rings and matzo ball soup, but whatever you order you
have to end with the crisp.

BRADLEY GAINS AS GORE IS TAINTED BY HIS ASSOCIATION WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) ,
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In two key states, Bill Bradley, ambling along in
his laconic, Jimmy Stewart manner, has pulled almost even in the
polls with Al Gore, who unfortunately is suffering from an acute
case of guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   The race between the two Democrats for their party's
presidential nomination is far from over. But it has taken a turn
that few experts anticipated last summer with Bradley's gains in
public opinion surveys in New Hampshire and New York and his large
accumulation of campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is an intelligent, likable fellow who was a Rhodes
scholar and a professional basketball star before becoming a U.S.
senator from New Jersey, he was not expected to provide a strong
challenge to Gore, who has had his eye on the presidency since his
aborted quest for the nomination in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But several things have happened to tighten the race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley has sought to position himself slightly to the
left of Gore, the defining difference between the two men is not
where they stand but whom they served.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters, weary of Bill Clinton and his numerous scandals,
see the vice president in the president's image. His loyalty to
Clinton thus has become a debit rather than a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is clemency for Puerto Rican rebels or
America's alleged role in Russia's presumed money-laundering
machinations, Republicans attack Gore just as vehemently as they do
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to make the electorate believe that Clinton's
vices and mistakes are Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for the vice president is his championing of
free trade, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Some blue-collar workers and labor leaders, especially those
from the industrial heartland, believe they should have protection
from foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   They do not understand that a boost in protective tariffs by the
United States could ignite a global trade war similar to the one
set off in 1930 with passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff act. That
measure, signed reluctantly by President Herbert Hoover, raised the
general level of duties on goods entering the country to 42
percent, the highest in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the Smoot-Hawley act exacerbated the Great
Depression. Although it was meant to protect industry and farmers,
it had exactly the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is: Our trading partners abroad need to be able to
sell their products in America if they are to buy American
products.
</P>
<P>
   Gore scored dramatically when, during a televised debate on the
merits of NAFTA five years ago, he presented a photograph of Sen.
Reed Smoot and Rep. Willis Hawley to Reform Party presidential
candidate Ross Perot, a vehement opponent of NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   He explained to Perot that although Smoot and Hawley looked like
nice men, their tariff is blamed by some economists and historians
for creating or expanding the Great Depression of the 1930s. Perot
was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stance on trade is the right one, but he may have
difficulty convincing his friends in organized labor of that fact.
And he needs the support of labor, which can provide him with
money, workers and votes.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that some Americans seek a return to discredited
protectionism when the free-trading United States is enjoying an
unprecedented period of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   A third problem for Gore is the fear numerous Democrats harbor
that he cannot defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush if Bush becomes the
GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not that Bradley's positions on trade and other
important issues are similar to Gore's. The perception is that
Bradley stands a better chance than Gore of winning in November
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If the public opinion polls are correct, millions of Americans
do not think of Gore as a strong leader. As often happens with vice
presidents, he is regarded as a mere shadow of the man in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of Dwight D. Eisenhower, his vice
president, Richard Nixon, lost the 1960 presidential race to John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Nixon succeeded in his quest for the White
House. But his victory was narrow because his Democratic opponent,
Vice President Hubert Humphrey, made impressive last-minute gains
after taking a position on Vietnam that was at odds _ although not
a total break _ with the policy of his president, Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mondale, who served as vice president under Jimmy Carter,
carried only his home state of Minnesota and the District of
Columbia when he ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1988 contest began, Reagan's vice president, George
Bush, trailed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis by 17 percentage
points. But Bush, father of the current GOP frontrunner, was able
to defeat Dukakis by hammering at him as an ideological liberal.
Bush accused him of being soft on crime and unpatriotic for vetoing
a measure that would have required Massachusetts school teachers to
lead their students in reciting the pledge of allegiance to the
flag each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been the outstanding vice president in American history
_ a true partner of the man in the White House. But if he is to win
his party's nomination and then the presidency, he is going to have
to find ways to demonstrate his own leadership qualities and his
independence from his friend Bill Clinton.

   Some people might envy James ``Woody'' Green's life as a member
of Dru Hill. After being discovered in 1995, the R&AMP;B group quickly
racked up enough sales to go platinum with hits like ``In My Bed''
and ``These Are the Times.'' They spent their lives in a blur,
hopping from New York City to Washington to Chicago performing for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years wore on, the thrill of waking up in St. Louis
and going to sleep in New Orleans disappeared for Green. In April,
the singer decided to temporarily chuck fame with Dru Hill and
return to the musical roots formed when he sang his first church
solo as a 3-year-old toddler.
</P>
<P>
   He'll record a gospel album.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 22, who was raised a Baptist, says his goal with the
record is ``to make it almost, like, cool for young people to
accept the Lord and not be ashamed to say they're Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Green's decision is not unusual. After all, the
relationship between black music and religion stretches back as far
as slavery, when Africans added musical oomph to Christian songs to
create Negro spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the only time major R&AMP;B and hip-hop artists
alluded to their spirituality was when they thanked God for winning
a Grammy, MTV, or Billboard award. Now, musicians are increasingly
giving Him more than a cursory heads up.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill read from the Bible when accepting her recent Grammy
Award for the album ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and credits
prayer for the eruption of creativity that spawned the record.
Artists like Puff Daddy, Faith Evans, Lil' Kim, and Mary J. Blige
openly discuss their religious beliefs in interviews.
</P>

   Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott recently told a journalist she
stopped smoking marijuana because God told her to. And a month

<P>
   BOSTON _ Now that the Oscars, Grammys, and Emmys have become
televised fashion shows, it only makes sense that high-profile
sporting events would be the next target. During this week's Ryder
Cup festivities, the players' wives and girlfriends are going to be
decked out Hollywood-style in head-to-toe Badgley Mischka.,
starting Wednesday night at a Four Seasons gala ball where Celine
Dion and the Boston Pops are scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods's girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda, is expected to wear a
burgundy beaded velvet bodice and printed silk skirt, while captain
Ben Crenshaw's wife, Julie, is wearing a blue-and-silver
lace-and-beaded sheath dress.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of star treatment is a first for the American team,
which normally doesn't coordinate garb for its social events, and a
real coup for a design duo identified mostly with events like the
Academy Awards. ``Most of our focus is celebrity dressing out of
Hollywood,'' said Mark Badgley, who flew into Boston Tuesday with
his partner, James Mischka, to attend a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion
show and the Ryder Cup ball and opening ceremony. ``But the whole
sports world has become so important. . . This is a great way for
us to introduce ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   European origin
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in fashion, the inspiration for all this drama
began in Europe. Two years ago, during the Ryder Cup in Spain, the
wives and partners of the European team all wore Escada gowns to
the gala ball, which got the Americans thinking. When Escada
offered to provide dresses for the US entourage this time, the
women declined because they wanted to support an American design
house like New York-based Badgley Mischka, which is in partnership
with the Germany-based Escada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled,'' said Julie Crenshaw, who was responsible for
coordinating the Ryder Cup women's wardrobes (including the
partners of the 12 players, herself, the assistant captain's wife,
and the officials' wives and girlfriends _ 21 women in all). ``When
you put on their dresses, you can't help but feel glamorous and
beautiful. . . We feel like princesses, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like princesses, the Ryder women don't have to worry
about paying for the $3,000 to $7,000 gowns. The PGA is footing the
bill for the formal dresses and coordinating handbags, as well as
for matching Badgley Mischka dresses for the opening ceremony and
women's uniforms for the games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tough choice
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To keep the planning simple for the gala event, Badgley and
Mischka flew their entire fall collection of about 150 dresses to
Augusta, Ga., for the Masters tournament in April. There, they
lined up the dress samples _ everything from velvets to lace to
satin to beading _ on racks in a big room and let the women go
nuts. ``It was crazy,'' recalls Crenshaw. ``It was a wonderful
scene. The girls had so much fun. It was overwhelming to have so
many beautiful choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriends and wives of the top 25 US players (the Ryder
Cup team hadn't been chosen yet) were instructed to select three
dresses they loved. Ultimately, the dress they would wear was
determined by how well their men performed on the links. ``It was
based on ranking,'' Crenshaw said. ``Fortunately, we didn't have
any duplicates.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cinderella problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After months of eager anticipation, the Ryder women will
actually wear their gowns for only a few hours. ``The PGA has
promised the players they'll be out by 10 p.m. They want them to
start focusing on the game,'' said Melissa Lehman, wife of Tom
Lehman of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all beautiful and dolled up and then get whisked away
by 10. . . At the last two (Ryder) balls, the one thing I wanted to
do was dance with my husband and there wasn't a lot of that by the
time you get done with the dinner part of it. I would rather do
away with the pomp and circumstance and just party. I'd prefer to
make it like the prom. Who wants to sit in a beautiful gown and eat
dinner? That's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
The morning after &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, at the opening ceremonies, the Ryder women will change
from their glamorous gowns into a more subdued Badgley Mischka
outfit designed specifically for the event: taupe crepe dresses
with three-quarter-length sleeves and satin waist bands and
coordinating full-length brocade jackets. ``We sort of wanted a
Jackie O. look for Boston,'' said Crenshaw. ``They are very
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Ryder women will sport everything from
hunter-green suede pants with yellow argyle mock turtlenecks and
matching cardigans to gray pinstriped skirts, shorts or pants,
blue-and-white striped blouses, and navy blazers. ``It's very New
England _ conservative and traditional,'' said Crenshaw.
``Everything we've done, we tried to keep in tune with New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what does one do with a Badgley Mischka evening gown after
the ball? Lehman has very specific plans. ``I'm hoping to wear it
to a George W. Bush inauguration,'' she said. ``We're part of his
campaign (team) in Phoenix.''

LONDON MILLENNIUM WHEEL ON SLIPPERY GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The raising of the world's biggest Ferris wheel on the
south bank of the Thames had been meant to herald the new
millennium. It has instead offered empirical evidence that those
dreaded millennium bugs do exist.
</P>
<P>
   Had all gone to plan, the 443-foot-high Millennium Wheel today
would be looking down on Big Ben, its venerable but relatively puny
neighbor on the opposite bank. Instead, it is lying supine on eight
temporary islands in the Thames, looking more like a giant roulette
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to raise the wheel on Sept. 10 was an
extravaganza of space-age engineering, an example of high
technology at its best, and worst. One of the myriad TV satellite
dishes there to capture the feat interfered with the laser beam
that had been monitoring the lifting process. After that problem
was resolved, one of the anchors that held one of the 30 cables
used in the lift came loose, forcing engineers to abandon the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, which is footing the cost, nearly $50 million,
of building the wheel, insists that it was only a temporary
setback. Jamie Bowden, a British Airways spokesman, said another
attempt to lift the wheel will take place in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty certain it will be up for millennium eve,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   While disappointed, the wheel's backers were not entirely
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the beginning, this is a very complicated
lift,'' Bowden said. ``This has never been done in the world
before. It was a hiccup, a setback, but not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Renwick, the project director, said that while heavier items
have been lifted, never has anyone tried to lift such a heavy
structure in such a confined space. The 1,500-ton wheel would pass
within 20 inches of the adjacent County Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When complete, the wheel will have 32 egg-shaped capsules that
can carry 25 people each. Adults will pay about $12, and children
$8, for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel will turn slowly, taking a half-hour to make a full
circle. From the top, weather permitting, one should see for 25
miles. The area would include seven counties, three airports, six
racecourses, 36 bridges over the Thames, 13 soccer stadiums, 165
golf courses, and 269 Underground stations.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways announced plans to put up the wheel in 1996, and
along with the opening of the city's Millennium Dome, the opening
of the wheel in January is supposed to be one of the highlights of
London's millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel is remarkable because London _ unlike New York, a city
it is often compared to _ is a horizontal metropolis, spread out
for miles lacking skyscrapers. At 443 feet, the wheel would be the
fourth tallest structure.
</P>
<P>
   Three times as tall as Tower Bridge, it will dwarf most of the
city's landmarks. It is more than twice the size of the Riesenrad
in Vienna, Europe's biggest and most famous Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   David Marks and Julia Barfield, the husband-and-wife architect
team behind the project, call their creation ``an observation
wheel.'' When raised, it will rival the observation decks on the
Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower in offering a panoramic
view of one of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Wheel, which is also called the London Eye, has
permission to stay where it is for only five years. Its builders,
however, expect to attract 3 million riders a year and hope that it
becomes so popular a tourist attraction that there will be a
consensus to leave it where it is. It will be managed by the people
who run Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum, a more established tourist
haunt.
</P>
<P>
   While aimed primarily at tourists, the Millennium Wheel will
offer native Britons a chance to literally look down on their
lawmakers across the river at what, from top, will look like very
small Houses of Parliament. When they do, some may find it hard to
resist mouthing the line that Harry Lime does in the classic film
``The Third Man,'' as he looks down on Vienna from the Riesenrad:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously old boy, would you really worry if one of those dots
stopped moving?''

started classes for the fall semester nearly a month ago.
Meanwhile, the National Autonomous University feels like a ghost
town.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are dark and quiet. The lawns where students and
professors usually gather for a quick chat are empty. The entrances
to the campus are blocked with old doors, scrap wire, and pieces of
desks that have been ripped apart. And the only flickers of life
come from the dimly lit hallways and outdoor tents that have been
set up to guard against intruders.
</P>
<P>
   For five months, the hemisphere's largest institution of higher
education, with a usual enrollment above 25,000, has been held
hostage and lifeless, a bargaining chip between a group of stubborn
students who refuse to let go of the sprawling campus and
administrators who refuse to push their way in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to stay until we believe that a university
education will remain within the reach of all of Mexico's families,
rich and poor,'' said one striker, who gave his name only as Tomas
P.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began as a protest by students against the rector
Francisco Barnes's proposal last spring to raise tuition for the
first time in 50 years, from about 2 cents a year to roughly $150.
</P>
<P>
   That issue was resolved in early June, when Barnes backed down
and said the new tuition would be voluntary. By then the students
had accumulated so much attention and momentum that rather than
turn over the facilities, they drew up a longer list of demands,
including a call for Barnes's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The new demands call for:
</P>
<P>
   --Scrapping tuition, including the voluntary one, and most
school-related fees.
</P>
<P>
   --Guaranteed admission to the National Autonomous University for
high school graduates, an old policy that was rescinded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   --The creation of a university congress of students.
</P>
<P>
   --The resolution of differences among professors and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   --A complete amnesty for the striking students.
</P>
<P>
   --Nullifying credit for courses that were held off-campus during
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike has worn on, frustration over the National
Autonomous University has been felt widely. Opinion polls have
found that most people want an end to the strike and to the
almost-daily marches that further clog the capital's jammed streets
with protests both for and against the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators, unable to resolve the problem, have turned to a
group of eight emeritus professors, who have drafted a proposal
that includes some, but not all, of the strikers' demands. On
Thursday, the University Council approved the plan as the platform
for a new round of negotiations that could begin this week.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers, meanwhile, once unified in their demands, have
splintered into moderate, radical or ``ultra'' factions, and have
quarreled among themselves. At one meeting in the campus's Che
Guevara auditorium, disputes over not to return to the table
deteriorated into a shoving and biting match between moderates and
radicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling the pressure of a strike which has lasted longer
than I think many of us expected,'' said Laura Jaramillo, 23, one
of the strikers, said on Friday as she sat near a makeshift bunker
in the School of Philosophy. ``But we're all committed to the same
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the strike continue to mount. According to one
estimate published this summer, about $5 million a day is lost in
revenue and grants. Nearly 500 research projects, financed mostly
by international organizations, have been postponed or canceled.
And more than 300,000 low-income patients have not been able to
receive treatment at university medical and dental clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Those students who want to return to classes have accused
administrators and even President Ernesto Zedillo of being
negligent by not forcing the strikers out and opening up the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The antistrike groups have even tried storming the campus in
hopes of pushing out the strikers. The most dramatic clash took
place on Aug. 23, when hundreds of demonstrators faced off on
Insurgentes Avenue, a major artery that runs outside the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Several people were injured, including journalists who were
caught in the melee, while police officers stood by and watched.
</P>
<P>
   For Zedillo and many other government officials, the strike is a
delicate political and personal issue. Many of the country's top
bureaucrats and politicans are National Autonomous University
alumni, including the president. But they all seem to fear that a
show of force against the students would create a repetition of the
1968 Tlatelolco Massacre, when scores of striking National
Autonomous University students were gunned down by police and
government troops.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who was part of the 1968 student movement, has vowed
that force would not be used to end the current protest, and made
only a vague allusion to the dispute in his annual State of the
Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico today, no one is censured for what he or she says,
writes or publishes,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The means used by this administration to address
conflicts that have so concerned public opinion will continue to be
legality, never authoritarianism; tolerance never violent
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the National Autonomous University's 270,000 students,
those at feeder high schools and at the university's main campus,
have lost last spring's semester because of the strike. And
officials fear that if a settlement is not negotiated soon, this
semester might also be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding 450 years ago, the National Autonomous
University has long been Mexico's premier higher learning center,
producing most of the country's doctors, lawyers, intellectuals and
engineers. It has had a unique stature in Mexican society as a
training ground for the country's elite and as a gateway to
economic opportunity for many of the country's working-class
families.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still considered the country's most storied and
valuable university, the National Autonomous University, proudly
called UNAM, has lost much of its luster, particularly as other
private schools in Mexico and the United States have recruited top
academics and students. Many private institutions in Mexico City,
where tuition can run as high as $5,000 a year, have reported
enrolling thousands of National Autonomous University students over
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the seemingly uncontrollable nature of the
strike points to the university's main administrative problem _
that it has grown too big to guarantee a high-quality curriculum
and that it should be decentralized.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the dispute more accurately mirrors the broader
themes that face Mexico, a country trying hard to modernize its
economic and political institutions without abandoning its populist
history.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the striking students have said their protests extend
beyond the university to the country's move toward a free-market
society.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking a more open and affordable National
Autonomous University, the students have spoken out against recent
government plans to privatize Mexico's electric industry. Some of
them have also traveled to the southern state of Chiapas to support
the Marxist Zapatista guerrillas who have been staging their own
rebellion since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican historian, Enrique Krauze, called the National
Autonomous University and the Chiapas rebellions ``soft
revolutions,'' where protesters have seized a small territory from
which they conduct their antigovernment campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing is happening with the university strike,''
Krauze wrote for this month's issue of ``Letras Libres,'' a leading
Mexican literary magazine. ``In the name of popular education, the
strikers have kidnapped UNAM.''

GIVING STUDENTS SERIOUS HELP WITH SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUDYWORKS SCIENCE (Mathsoft; $29.95 for Windows 3.1 or later,
$39.95 for Macintosh 7.1 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   First, some words about what Studyworks Science is not. It's not
one of those ``edutainment'' programs starring a cartoon rodent in
a superhero costume who demonstrates 101 experiments that can be
done with stuff from the pantry or illustrates the first law of
thermodynamics by hotfooting his neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   No, Studyworks Science is serious software, designed to help
high school and college students. It combines the power of a
scientific calculator with the advantages of a computer, offering
an unusual word-and-math processor, a resource library and Web and
newsgroup links on physics, chemistry, earth science, statistics
and biology. (The latest version of the program also treats
astronomy as a separate subject.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as math lies at the heart of much of science, so too is it
the soul of this program. That's not so surprising: Mathsoft, the
developer, is the company behind Mathcad, a program used by
engineers and other professionals who crunch numbers for a living.
And Studyworks Science is itself a companion of Studyworks Math,
designed to help with everything from algebra to calculus.
</P>
<P>
   All that math in its pedigree shows. Studyworks Science is often
at its best when dealing with numbers. It is less successful when
it delves into scientific concepts.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the program is the worksheet. It's a blank
screen, ready for words and formulas. Studyworks generally knows
the difference between the two, though occasionally it needs a
little assistance.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find a blank page daunting, there's help in the
form of the Resource Center, a window that contains the Web and
newsgroup links and, above all, the library. The library is divided
by subject, with a special section for reference tables, including
an easy-to-use, annotated periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   So a student who has to write up an experiment on the volume of
gases, say, can call up the Chemistry library, find a link for
Avogadro's principle and find both an explanation (it holds that
equal volumes of any gases at the same temperature and pressure
contain the same number of molecules) and formulas, including one
for determining the mass of a volume of one gas given the mass of a
volume of a second gas.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good. But what makes Studyworks really useful,
particularly to the student who may not have paid full attention in
class, is that both the principle and the formula can be pasted
into the worksheet. In this way, the program makes it easy to build
a report that demonstrates that the budding scientist really knows
the field, or at least makes it seem that way.
</P>
<P>
   The worksheet's math capabilities are especially useful.
Functions can be defined and values changed at will, and results in
many cases are calculated instantaneously. A math palette provides
an easy way to enter symbols for square roots, differential
equations and the like, and a graphing palette offers the same
kinds of capabilities as a graphing calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The placement of formulas and equations on the page, however, is
critical: those higher up get calculated first, and since one
equation can bear on another, sloppy presentation can produce
inaccurate results. Neatness counts, even on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The resource center's toolbar is a bit like a Web browser's,
with buttons for paging forward and backward within a subject, and
a ``backtrack'' feature equivalent to a browser's back button.
There is also a ``history'' button to make it easier, say, to skip
back to a page listing Jupiter's mass from a page with a formula
for calculating escape velocity from a planet.
</P>
<P>
   The library is most extensive in math-heavy subjects like
physics and chemistry. The earth science and biology sections are
less exhaustive and some of the entries, particularly in biology,
are so cursory as to be of little value to a serious student.
</P>
<P>
   They may, however, be of interest to those for whom a little bit
of knowledge goes a long way (the student's parents, for example).
To that end, the library also contains ``made simple'' entries that
try to explain a concept with easy-to-grasp examples.
</P>
<P>
   The resource center also includes a how-to section on the
program's basic features, and one on more advanced tips and
techniques. There's a lot to learn, although the company says that
students can figure out the essentials in 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but probably only for the best students.
Others may take a lot longer, and there will certainly be some
students for whom Studyworks, like science itself, is too
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises a basic question about the program's ultimate
usefulness. The students who are most able to make use of it
probably need it the least _ they know the formulas and laws, or if
they don't, they at least know how to find them easily. Those
students who have difficulty coping with science will probably find
it hard coping with Studyworks Science as well.

 (Attn: Ga.)  (af) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago a computer programmer and electronics wizard
named Ryan Sheldon was presented with the task of developing a
keyboard for a challenging crowd. It was a group that had never
used computers, that had difficulty performing fine hand movements
and that would rather romp in the trees than learn to type.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's mission was to design a wireless keyboard for bonobos
_ small apes that are often called, inaccurately, pygmy chimpanzees
_ so they could use it to communicate. His supervisor was Sue
Savage-Rumbaugh, a scientist who has been trying to prove that the
animals are capable of developing language.
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting the help of Sheldon, Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh and
other researchers at Georgia State University had been
communicating with the bonobos by pointing to a board arrayed with
symbols, or lexigrams, that represented words. The researchers
would touch the lexigrams while demonstrating their meanings. Their
hope was that the bonobos would also point to the lexigrams to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The lexigram board was not ideal, however. Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh
wanted something that would show the apes that they could generate
their own words by touching the symbols. One intermediary answer
was a joystick that the bonobos used to point to lexigrams on a
computer screen. But it was awkward and hard to transport in the
woods outside Atlanta where much of the research is done.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's solution is a wireless keyboard that sends radio
signals to a computer that then ``speaks'' the bonobos' words by
playing recorded voice files in English.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon completed the first keyboard a year ago. Since then,
four have been built, and a couple of electronics companies have
agreed to manufacture the parts. Sheldon, who learned to program on
his own and does not have a college degree, has since opened his
own company, National Control Devices, that will continue to
develop the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Each keyboard weighs about six pounds and consists of three
panels covered with grids of colored lexigrams. There are 384
lexigrams in all, representing words from ``a'' to ``yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Sheldon said, the bonobos will string the words
together to communicate larger thoughts. Such word sequences, Dr.
Savage-Rumbaugh has argued, show that the bonobos are capable of
constructing sentences. (Other scientists, notably Noam Chomsky,
dispute her research, arguing that the apes are merely being
conditioned to react to certain stimuli.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sheldon said, the bonobos show no signs of repetitive
stress injuries or other ailments that afflict humans who use
keyboards. But at least one ape has demonstrated a tendency to take
out his frustration on the device.
</P>
<P>
   When Kanzi, a particularly vain bonobo, discovered that he was
passed up in a recent photo shoot, he tore at the keyboard with his
teeth. ``He ripped each panel just enough to stop them from
working,'' Sheldon said.

   As any trend-tracking economist will tell you, most employees
don't have jobs anymore; they have careers. Few people expect to
use one set of skills for the rest of their lives. Fewer still
expect to stick with one employer.
</P>
<P>
   Online job boards are paying attention. What began as simple
databases of classified advertisements have been transformed into
online career counselors, combining equal parts practical advice
and training and dime-store psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entrant in this field is Brass Ring, based in New
York. It announced Wednesday that it would offer training tools,
online and off-line career fairs, job listings, information and
hiring software for companies to use to sort and manage the resumes
that come their way.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the company stand out from other job-board sites is
its corporate pedigree. Brass Ring combines the resources of
several companies: Kaplan Educational Centers, which runs career
fairs and professional training centers; The Pavement, a Web site
that offers career information for college graduates, and Hire
Systems, a company that develops hiring-management software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was built under the belief that the world will not work
exclusively on line or off line,'' said Jonathan Grayer, Brass
Ring's chairman and chief executive. ``People lead fluid lives''
that require a combination of person-to-person communication and
online efficiency, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Grayer envisions that once the Web site (www.brassring.com) is
complete, it will be able to assist people with all career
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a computer programmer who is considering a career
shift from C (plus, plus) programming to network administration
could go to the site to determine what skills would be required and
then take an online assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The site would provide test results, links to online training
classes, job searches and resume services. Job seekers can even
meet potential employers on line before sealing the deal at
sponsored job fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Gluck, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, said that
other sites were also trying to add training options or combine
services for employers and employees. But Brass Ring has the
benefit of a large cash infusion from its corporate investors,
which most other sites are missing.

<P>
   Some people might envy James ``Woody'' Green's life as a member
of Dru Hill. After being discovered in 1995, the R&AMP;B group quickly
racked up enough sales to go platinum with hits like ``In My Bed''
and ``These Are the Times.'' They spent their lives in a blur,
hopping from New York City to Washington to Chicago performing for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years wore on, the thrill of waking up in St. Louis
and going to sleep in New Orleans disappeared for Green. In April,
the singer decided to temporarily chuck fame with Dru Hill and
return to the musical roots formed when he sang his first church
solo as a 3-year-old toddler.
</P>
<P>
   He'll record a gospel album.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 22, who was raised a Baptist, says his goal with the
record is ``to make it almost, like, cool for young people to
accept the Lord and not be ashamed to say they're Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Green's decision is not unusual. After all, the
relationship between black music and religion stretches back as far
as slavery, when Africans added musical oomph to Christian songs to
create Negro spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the only time major R&AMP;B and hip-hop artists
alluded to their spirituality was when they thanked God for winning
a Grammy, MTV, or Billboard award. Now, musicians are increasingly
giving Him more than a cursory heads up.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill read from the Bible when accepting her recent Grammy
Award for the album ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and credits
prayer for the eruption of creativity that spawned the record.
Artists like Puff Daddy, Faith Evans, Lil' Kim, and Mary J. Blige
openly discuss their religious beliefs in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott recently told a journalist she
stopped smoking marijuana because God told her to. And a month
after Green announced his gospel plans, Puff Daddy protege
MA(dollar)E left the music business because of his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a major artist speaking about his or her belief in
God would be considered almost corny. But a slew of factors has
recently made religion positively cool.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the trend along was a wave of spirituality in the 1990s
that encouraged people to dabble in everything from Buddhism to
kabala. A new generation of pastors has ditched the
brimstone-and-fire talk of traditional churches to connect with
younger people. And it doesn't hurt that Kirk Franklin and Whitney
Houston powered gospel albums up the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people just need it,'' says Cheryl James, the salty
half of the female hip-hop group Salt-n-Pepa, who was a guest
vocalist on Franklin's gospel-pop hit ``Stomp.'' ``This business is
so hard, it's so convoluted, and it's so dirty sometimes. It can
leave you feeling really, really empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no choice, almost,'' continues James, who now
worships at a nondenominational church near her Long Island home.
``It's like you would really want to shrivel up and die without
knowing that there's something more.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward spirituality comes as black music wallows in a
moral low. R &AMP; B songs have become so sexually explicit they'd
embarrass Marvin Gaye, and rappers vie to outdo each other with
graphic portrayals of misogyny and violence. By embracing religion,
musicians have an opportunity to do something they've often
shunned: act as role models.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cynics out there say the talk of spirituality is about
as real as the hair Houston sports in her ``My Love is Your Love''
video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lil' Kim says she's found the Lord, yet she's still going on
the stage with her breasts hanging out and her butt hanging out,''
says Jimmi ``Jam'' Richards, a radio personality for Chicago's No.
1 urban music station WGCI-FM. ``Walk the walk that's all I say.
Live your life that way. Don't just say it in words.''
</P>
<P>
   Music and spirituality have never been distant cousins in the
African-American community. Long before Bone Thugs-N-Harmony urged
their homies to meet them at the crossroads in their hit song,
Edwin ``Oh Happy Day'' Hawkins and the Staple Singers brought their
religious ethics to the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   Little Richard, Al Green, and Rev. Run (of Run-DMC) are ordained
ministers. And everyone from Aretha Franklin to K-Ci and JoJo
Hailey got their start singing in choirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is the music conservatory for blacks,'' says Vicki
Mack Lataillade, the gospel record label owner who discovered
Franklin and other chart-topping gospel groups. ``Anybody pretty
much that can sing learned how to sing in the church.''
</P>
<P>
   But musicians make their living selling a hip veneer to their
listeners. Adding religion to the mix can threaten that surface
cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop has been so much about rebelling,'' says Tracii
McGregor, executive editor of The Source magazine, which delved
into the issue of spirituality and rap in 1997, ``that to say that
you are religious and that you went to church every week, you're
almost kind of playing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow James and Woody Green have avoided that trap. Green says
people have come up to him on the street to tell him his ability to
walk away from Dru Hill's fame inspired them to step away from
their own problems. Others have asked him about God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a responsibility now as an artist,'' says
Green. ``Now I have to watch what I do because people are
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   And that gaze can be pretty harsh. Some artists keep their
spirituality under wraps so their every action won't be analyzed
and criticized by the religious mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have been afraid to say anything because then
you get put under a microscope,'' says James, launching into a
litany of disapproval: `` `Oh, what are you doing at the club?'
`That dress is too tight.' `She ain't really saved.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You subject yourself to a lot of that criticism,'' James
continues, ``and that's really a hard thing to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill was on the receiving end of such criticisms earlier
this year. Her lifestyle had the readers of the Internet's
Electronic Urban Report (www.eurweb.com), a chatty compendium of
black pop-culture news, in heated debate after someone called Hill
a hypocrite for having two children out of wedlock while claiming
to be religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a woman with plenty of money,'' says Jimmi ``Jam''
Richards, who was also one of the Electronic Urban Report readers
who wrote in about Hill. ``She can afford to get married if she
chooses to. That's just something that I don't want my daughter to
think is OK. I don't want my sons to think that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   James, who this summer gave birth to her second child, a boy,
but remains unmarried, calls that kind of attitude ``ignorant.''
She grew up going to church, but when she got involved with Salt N'
Pepa she ``felt like I didn't need church anymore,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   James soon found success was not enough. She began reading the
Bible. Then the birth of her daughter sealed her religious fate.
</P>
<P>
   James jokes that she bounced from Pentecostal to Baptist to
nondenominational churches searching for a religious base. She
couldn't find a pastor who would support her lifestyle choices.
Instead, they wrapped her in a blanket of moral rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some churches put serious guilt trips on you,'' says James.
``Tell you what you're not supposed to do. And if you're doing that
particular thing and you haven't found the strength to stop doing
it, you just walk around feeling guilty and still doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a younger generation of pastors takes over churches
nationwide, the tone is becoming less censorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing younger `hip-hop preachers' who will flip the
language and welcome anyone into their church,'' says McGregor.
``That's the key, the church has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pastors incorporate rap culture into their ministries to
entice the young, they're also reaching out to the black music
world.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, for instance, has acted as spiritual adviser to R &AMP; B
crooner R. Kelly. Hezekiah Walker, pastor of the Love Fellowship
Tabernacle church in Brooklyn, provides religious guidance to Puff
Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the moral road can get rocky when music and
spirituality meet. Take the example of Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago Tribune review caught him testifying about his
religious beliefs during a 1997 concert: ``I've come to find out
that whatever it is you want, it's in the Lord,'' Kelly said. ``I
used to be flying in sin. Now, I'm flying in Jesus.'' But this
year, Kelly spent his summer tour simulating sex on an onstage bed.
</P>
<P>
   Puff Daddy showcases a spiritual side on his new album
``Forever'' in a song called ``My Best Friend.'' But listeners only
get to God after vignettes where a young child curses and someone
shoots people from a Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   Richards believes the artists have decided that consumer dollars
are more important than their souls. ``You have to be realistic and
say that gospel music is just not selling the way secular music
does,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the gurgles of spirituality from major artists,
gospel music is not an easy sell to the public either. Kym
Norsworthy, senior publicist at Interscope Records, is trying to
get mainstream radio and media interested in Gospel Gangstaz, a
trio of born-again former LA gangbangers who rap about God N' the
Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Norsworthy speaks about the group with the fervor of a Baptist
preacher. But few have bitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first instinct is that musically and lyrically it's
probably not going to be as strong as I want my rap music to be,''
says Norsworthy. ``They can't be that good if they're talking about
church and God.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Green is trying to circumvent that treacherous dead end
with his gospel album. The eight songs he has completed so far
touch on God's positive influence on his life. But Green won't be
the moral taskmaster telling listeners ``don't have sex'' and
``don't use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm the right person to give them that,'' says
Green. ``They just got finished less than a year ago seeing me on
stage humping the floor and singing about making love. I'd sound
like a fool talking about `stop having sex.' ''

 &HT;    ONLINE BIDDING: NEW DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY
 &HT;    Online bidding: A new demand on same supply
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ THE MOOD IS TENSE. Bidding on the gray-green Mayan
jade mask is rising in $5,000 increments and auctioneer C. Hugh
Hildesley is quick to move the bidding upward with sharp raps of
his ivory gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 people are on the auction floor of Sotheby's for the
firm's semi-annual sale of pre-Columbian art. The handful bidding
on Lot 165 signal with a nod or the muted wave of blue-and-white
numbered paddles.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders on the floor, however, are soon outclassed as the action
shifts to Sotheby's 12 phone lines, where company representatives
are bidding for clients on three continents. Above the floor, a
tote board flashes the escalating bids in dollars, francs, marks,
pesos and pesetas. In less than three minutes, the board reads
$325,000 and only two bidders remain.
</P>
<P>
   A Sotheby's specialist queries her client on the other end of
the line in Spanish and nods. The bid is $330,000. Hildesley takes
a sip of Evian and looks to the other phone. A long silence, then a
shake of the head. The gavel seals the deal. The 2,100-year-old
mask, previously owned by an anonymous New York collector, has just
been sold to an equally anonymous bidder in Europe. Final price,
including the buyer's premium: $365,500.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been at Sotheby's since 1744, when London bookseller
Samuel Baker founded what would become one of the world's premier
venues for the sale of art, antiquities and other collectibles _
from rare baseball memorabilia to $78 million Renoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Sotheby's will launch a new venture that it hopes
will revolutionize the auction business. Sotheby's is moving into
cyberspace _ a move that has the art world buzzing and
archaeologists uneasy about the impact that the millions of
potential new buyers could have on the global demand for
antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's first online sale _ a follow-up to the Sept. 23-29
live auction of baseball memorabilia _ isn't expected until later
this fall, but the firm has already lined up 3,200 dealers
worldwide to provide material for future sales, a roster that will
make it a global clearinghouse for collectibles of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its high visibility, Sotheby's now draws only about
100,000 buyers and sellers a year to its auctions. Executive Vice
President David Redden says Sothebys.com wants as many of the
estimated 100 million Internet users as it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are uncomfortable or shy about coming into the
showroom and bidding at a live auction,'' says Sotheby's Executive
Vice President David Redden. ``But we don't think they will feel
shy about shopping in their bedroom slippers in the privacy of
their own homes. They will be able to rummage through the world for
things to buy. The potential for reaching huge numbers of people is
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of online auctions and artifact sales is an
unfortunate development,'' says Ellen Herscher, chairman of the
Archaeological Institute of America's cultural property committee.
``The demand for such things has always been a very specialized
market. This broadens it in a way that can only create greater
demand, at a time when there is already a big rise in demand for
classical antiquities.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the burgeoning online market for artifacts _ and the
questions it poses _ can be seen at two popular Internet auction
sites: eBa, which recently bought the prestigious West Coast
auction house, Butterfield and Butterfield, and Amazon.com, which
has taken a $10 million stake in Sotheby's. Amazon plans to share
an auction site with Sotheby's, but currently operates two auction
sites of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two online giants lure 20 million visitors a month
to their Web sites. Although items for sale range from used
computers to old Pez dispensers, the number of artifacts, American
as well as international, has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day, eBay offered a total of 1,338 items under the
heading of ``Native Americana, artifacts'' _ ranging from a
1,000-year-old Anasazi cameo bowl (minimum bid $500) from Arizona
to a 3.25-inch arrowhead (minimum bid $70) which the owner ``found
last year in the Flint River a few miles above Albany, Ga.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former federal prosecutor for the eastern district of
Virginia, eBay's associate general counsel, Robert Chestnut, is
aware that people may be using the online auction site to buy and
sell illegal artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have removed some things from the site already: Native
American remains, burial goods and ritual objects,'' Chestnut says.
``But we have more than 300,000 items posted every day in over
1,000 categories from chintz china to Beanie Babies. We can't
review everything that is offered for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The items eBay sells are of the sort and price typical of flea
markets and artifact shows. Because they are online, however, buyer
and seller complete their transaction without ever meeting, or even
knowing each other's names.
</P>
<P>
   `We don't tolerate fraud, but ...'
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon.com's auctions, the artifacts tend to be pricier and
more international in flavor. In one recent sale, Web surfers could
choose from a 1,650-year-old Roman jug from Lebanon (reserve price
of $125), a pair of Mexican Nayarit figurines ($2,500) and a
Peruvian head vessel with stirrup handle ($335).
</P>
<P>
   Were the items legally exported from the country of origin?
Amazon officials are frank about their inability to assure buyers
that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate fraud, but buying online is no different
than buying anywhere else,'' says Sharon Greenspan, spokeswoman for
the company. ``You still have to buy from a reputable dealer and
you have to educate yourself. We encourage everybody to be smart
shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other Internet sites, however, offer direct,
person-to-person sales of a wide variety of artifacts, ranging from
Civil War belt buckles to Neanderthal skulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating a growing number of Internet-related
cases, a number of which involve the sale of human body parts,''
says John Fryar, criminal investigator for the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs in Santa Fe, N.M. ``There is definitely increased
interest, and at least the potential for a lot more illegal
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has made it easy to put stuff on the black
market, but in some ways it has also made it easier for us to track
it. Until recently no one was watching these auction sites. Now we
have people who call us when they see something suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's hopes its entry into the world of sales will bring a
level of trust and integrity to the wild and woolly frontier of
cyberspace. Although Redden says the firm intends to offer items
for sale in ``every collecting category,'' he says plans for the
sale of ancient art are proceeding with ``some caution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to issues of authenticity and condition, we
obviously have to be concerned about export laws,'' he says. ``We
have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has vowed to guarantee the condition and authenticity
of all of the material it offers for sale online. But any assurance
that artifacts have been legally removed from their countries of
origin would likely continue to depend, as is the case at live
auctions now, on the say-so of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Sotheby's officials believe, the prestige of the firm _
and the thousands of dealers from which it will take consignments _
will foster a thriving market in high-end art at price levels seen
today only at live auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little hard to imagine a major sale of
impressionist paintings on the Net, but we don't know what the
upper limit will be,'' says Redden. ``I had once thought that
$10,000 might be the upper limit, but now I'm not so sure. Even
interactive bidders have certain gladiatorial instincts when it
comes to bidding.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A SAMPLE OF ARTIFACTS BEING AUCTIONED ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Sales of artifacts on the Internet have grown rapidly this year
with the launch of major online auction sites. These are a few of
the hundreds of items offered for sale at eBay and Amazon.com in
the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean figurine, 400-100 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Found in Ecuador. Jamacoaque Cult. Dating: 400-100 BC. BIRDMAN
with red tint, wings and nose chipped. Measures 3 1/2' tall. VERY
NICE!! Lucite base for easy display. Comes with Cert. of
authenticity. Buyer pays $5 S/H in US. Don't miss this one!!''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican ceramics, 500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   This piece has both beautiful coloring and lines. The handle
displays intricate workmanship. Overall this is a must have piece.
I know the feeling of seeing the same merchandise offered over and
over again. I truly believe that this is not the case with this
item. It is a large focal point piece measuring 5 1/2 in high and
nearly 8 in across. All my merchandise comes with a COA and an
Unconditional Authenticity Guarantee. Do not hesitate on this
piece!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian vessel, A.D. 1400
</P>
<P>
   ``This 8 3/8' tall black-on-cream figural jar (TF 97.135) is
from the Chancay culture of Peru, c.1100-1400 A.D. The figure is
said to depict a beggar due to the fact that he holds a small cup
in his hands as though asking for a 'donation.' This wonderfully
depicted figure wears a tufted shawl, displays a pair of impressive
earspools, has a well-decorated headdress or crown, and exhibits
what appears to be tattooing of the face with fish-like imagery
around his eyes and a mask-like covering of his mouth and chin. In
overall very good condition, there has been some minor repair on
the chipped rim and a small amount of overpaint. Fully guaranteed
to be authentic and as described. Shipping/packaging/insurance are
all included in the price; however, appropriate taxes will be extra
if mailed to a Colorado address (international buyer pays actual
shipping cost).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks and good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese figurine, A.D. 618-906
</P>
<P>
   ``Tang Dynasty (618 - 906). 15 1/2'' height. _ This is a serious
collector's piece. It is rare to see a figure like it. We have the
analysis report of Thermoluminescence test from Oxford
Authentication, Ltd. If you want to see it before you buy, please
contact us to make an appointment. The packing, shipping and
insurance costs for it is $100. Please visit our web site for other
products.''

 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    Georgia theft robs world of unique legacy
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGIA'S HOT POTS just keep popping up. A quarter-century after
thieves cleaned out the little museum at Kolomoki Mounds State
Park, near Blakely, the state's most famous stolen pots are still
showing up in out-of-the-way places. Each new sighting offers a
fleeting glimpse of the black market in American antiquities and
new hope that more of the 1,500-year-old pots will someday be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Although the missing Kolomoki artifacts never dazzled like
pre-Columbian gold or Etruscan silver, the intricately shaped clay
bowls and figurines are, even in absentia, among the most revered
relics of ancient Georgia and its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were some of the most fantastic items created in
Georgia's prehistory,'' says Frank Snell, archaeologist for the
nearby Columbus Museum. ``The loss of these objects is tragic. A
photograph can't begin to show what they are like. I'd give my
eyeteeth to see them all returned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the crime was widely reported. Sometime between
March 3 and March 7, 1974, someone broke into the park-operated
museum housing the artifacts from Georgia's oldest ceremonial mound
complex _ a cluster of flat-topped pyramid-like structures built
more than 1,000 years ago. The thieves stole 129 items, including a
dozen rare effigy vessels, a large collection of clay bowls, 20
stone axes and several dozen arrowheads.
</P>
<P>
   The street value of the stolen artifacts was estimated at
$400,000. The impact on the park museum was swift. With virtually
nothing left to display, it closed.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to history was far greater. The stolen artifacts
represented a substantial share _ a third or more _ of the world's
known objects from the Weeden Island culture, which inhabited North
Florida and South Georgia between A.D. 300 and 800. At Kolomoki,
they built at least seven earthen mounds _ the tallest 56 feet high
_ several centuries before the construction of Georgia's better
known prehistoric mound complexes at Etowah and Ocmulgee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Kolomoki have no known living descendants,''
says Larry Blakenship, former manager of the park. ``So the only
way we had to learn about these people is to study the artifacts
they left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, ironically, the distinctive style of Kolomoki's ancient
artisans _ complex patterns of stylistic incising and stippled cuts
in clay, along with a penchant for elaborate animal effigies _ that
has made it harder for them to disappear than most stolen
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Georgia and Florida law enforcement officials seized 12
of the pots at the home of an amateur archaeologist in North Miami.
Unaware that they were stolen, the collector had acquired them at a
Miami Beach rock and gem show in exchange for a collection of
antique bottles. Police traced the seller as far as Tallahassee,
but there the trail went cold.
</P>
<P>
   The pots were returned to Kolomoki for safekeeping, but had to
be stored in a cell at the Early County Jail until Georgia could
build a more secure museum.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more. In 1979, Frank Morast, a collector in
Columbus, identified a Kolomoki pot at an artifact show in
Pennsylvania. He bought it and donated it to the park museum. No
one ever learned how it got to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent recoveries suggest that by now Kolomoki's
missing treasures have changed hands so many times that some of the
current owners don't have a clue about the cultural importance of
the pots _ and may not even suspect that they are part of the loot
from Georgia's most notorious antiquities theft.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Cordell, staff archaeologist for the Florida Museum of
Natural History in Gainesville, Fla., remembers her astonishment
one day in 1996 when a local taxidermist showed her pictures of two
pots _ carefully crafted effigies of a wood duck and a quail in the
Weeden Island style _ that he was thinking about buying from a
collector in St. Petersburg. The collector wanted $300 for the
pair. The taxidermist wanted to know if Cordell thought they were
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell thought the pots _ one buff-colored and the other a dull
red _ looked uncannily familiar. A trip to the reference shelf
enabled her to make a positive ID. Pictures of the very pots which
at that moment graced the living room mantle of Thomas Duddy of St.
Petersburg were listed as vessel 2 and vessel 18 in the 1953 report
``Excavations at Kolomoki by archaeologist William H. Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordell would eventually examine the pots herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mend marks _ the seams where they were glued together _
made it clear they were the exact same pots,'' she says. ``And when
I shined a flashlight inside, I could see the ID numbers put there
by the excavators nearly 50 years before.''
</P>
<P>
   No reward for state's missing treasures
</P>
<P>
   As the unsuspecting owner of stolen property, Duddy was more
than happy to cooperate with authorities. He just wanted to be rid
of the pots, which he had by this time owned for a number of years,
unaware that they were anything but curiously ``primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duddy had been given the pots by his mother. Questioned by
authorities, she recalled buying them for her son at a flea market
in nearby Gulfport, Fla., in 1987. She paid $45 for the pair, which
experts agree could have sold elsewhere for hundreds. And there, as
it had so many times before, the trail of Kolomoki's hot pots went
cold again.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for yet another pot to turn up. The Florida
taxidermist who had been interested in buying Duddy's pots checked
his own collection and, to his surprise, discovered that he had
another Kolomoki pot, the effigy of an owl, that had been in his
collection for years. He voluntarily turned it over to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 of the stolen pots have been found and returned to
Kolomoki, where they now occupy a cherished place in the display
case of a new museum _ with improved security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cultural significance of the Kolomoki artifacts
Georgia has never made the recovery of Kolomoki's missing treasures
a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   None of the missing pots has ever been seized in the state of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   No reward has ever been offered for their return.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever been arrested for the theft. Given the time that
has elapsed since the burglary, arrests are now unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black market in artifacts is really secretive,'' says
Blakenship. ``We still investigate one or two leads a year, but I
think the pieces are probably well scattered, and by now the trail
is pretty cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Department of Natural Resources has never directly
enlisted the public in tracing the stolen artifacts, despite
suggestions by archaeologists that the state try to flush the
missing pots into the open by publishing ``wanted'' posters or
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still thinking about it,'' says Townsend. ``We hope we
might get some of them printed this year yet.''

 &HT;    The 20-year odyssey of a golden greek bowl

<P>
   History:
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented in the modern world until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   1980
</P>
<P>
   Sicilian antique collector Vincenzo Pappalardo asks Giacamo
Manganaro, a professor of Greek history, to authenticate a
ceremonial gold bowl, a phiale. Pappalardo claims it was unearthed
by workers digging up electrical lines near Catania, Sicily, on the
site of an ancient Greek settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mid- to late 1980s
</P>
<P>
   Pappalardo trades the phiale to Vincenzo Cammarata, a Sicilian
coin dealer, for artworks valued at $20,000. Cammarata shows the
phiale to William Veres, a Zurich art dealer and specialist in
antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   November 1991
</P>
<P>
   Veres brings the phiale to the attention of Robert Haber, an
American art dealer. Haber travels to Sicily to examine the phiale.
He informs Wall Street financier Michael Steinhardt that the phiale
is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   December 1991
</P>
<P>
   Veres acquires the phiale from Cammarata for objects worth
$90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 4, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, with Haber acting as intermediary, agrees to pay
Veres $1.2 million for the phiale.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber flies to Zurich and then travels to Lugano, Switzerland on
the Italian border to meet Veres.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 12, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber takes possession of the phiale from Veres and returns to
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber lands at JFK International Airport with the phiale in his
luggage. The customs declaration puts its value as $250,000. It is
identified as coming from a private collection in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 6, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber has the phiale authenticated by the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, which acquired a similar bowl from art dealer Robert Hecht in
1962. The Met declares Steinhardt's phiale to be as authentic as
its own.
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt displays the phiale in the drawing room of his New
York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   1995
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government asks the United States to help recover
the phiale, which it deems, under the country's national patrimony
law, to have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 9, 1995
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents seize the phiale from Steinhardt's Fifth
Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14, 1997
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court in New York orders forfeiture of the phiale
and its return to Italy. Steinhardt appeals.
</P>
<P>
   December 1998
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities arrest six people in Sicily _ including
Manganaro and Cammarata _ for alleged participation in an
antiquities looting ring linked to the Mafia. Authorities
confiscate more than 10,000 artifacts, valued at more than $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   July 12, 1999
</P>
<P>
   After hearing briefs from the American Association of Museums,
on behalf of Steinhardt, and from the Archaeological Institute of
America on behalf of the U.S. government, the U.S. Court of Appeals
reaffirms the forfeiture.

 &HT;    Buying, selling, stealing history
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE GOLDEN PHIALE OF ACHYRIS may soon be winging its way home to
Italy _ the last leg of a decade-long odyssey that has spanned the
cultural divide between an antiquities smuggling ring in rural
Sicily and the Fifth Avenue apartment of a Wall Street financier.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after U.S. Customs agents seized the 2,400-year-old
bowl from the home of hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, a U.S.
appellate court has affirmed that the 24-karat treasure was
illegally imported into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The courts say Italy, not Steinhardt, is the rightful owner.
Antiquities dealers say the decision could cripple the thriving
trade in ancient art. Archaeologists say it's a milestone in the
effort to protect the world's eroding cultural heritage. Italy just
hopes the phiale's return will send a message to collectors as old
as antiquity itself: Let the buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt's star status on Wall Street and the $1.2 million
price he paid for the phiale guaranteed a high profile for the case
from the beginning. But in a legal arena where art and archaeology
are often at loggerheads, the case has become a cause celebre for
another reason. The shallow bowl, which once held ancient Greeks'
offerings to the gods, has served up a rare, revealing glimpse of
the international antiquities market in action.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, shipping crates and suitcases full of ancient art
and artifacts _ large and small, legal and illegal _ spill across
the porous borders of the world: Turkish icons to Germany.
Cambodian temple reliefs to Thailand. Malian terra cotta figurines
to New York. Native American artifacts to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For a host of reasons _ fear of theft, fear of taxes, fear of
publicity _ even legitimate transactions in the world of ancient
art are often very private affairs. Because the traffic in illicit
antiquities is even more secretive, determining its scope is like
the proverbial blind man trying to guess the shape of an elephant
by touching only one part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which has been waging an aggressive war against the
illegal antiquities trade, has seized 122,000 pieces of art and
artifacts in the past five years, but authorities don't know how
many got away. Mexico last year recovered 10,000 artifacts stolen
from its archaeological sites, but acknowledges that the seizures
are a fraction of the total. In America, the National Park Service,
the lead agency for archaeological protection, spends more than $3
million a year on enforcement, but manages to arrest someone in
only about 10 percent of the 800 looting incidents each year on
federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, the international police agency, says the global
market in looted and stolen antiquities ranges from $4 billion to
$5 billion a year. That puts the smuggling of antiquities on a par
with illegal arms, and second only to international traffic in
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its clandestine deals, code of silence, smuggling
networks, laundered titles and phony export licenses, the
antiquities trade has more in common with drug trafficking and
organized crime than with most legitimate enterprises,'' says
Ricardo Elia, a Boston University archaeologist who studies the
trade of illicit artifacts. ``The difference _ and the problem for
law enforcement _ is that drugs are illegal all the time. Artifacts
may be illegal when they are dug up and smuggled out of a country,
but by the time they get laundered through third countries like
Switzerland and wind up here, they may wind up legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much activity is hidden from view, specifics emerge
only as snapshots: a chance airport seizure, an isolated arrest, a
looter caught in the act. In the case of the phiale, however, court
records submitted by U.S. and Italian investigators have traced the
travels of the golden bowl all the way from a suspected Sicilian
smuggling ring to the place of honor it occupied atop Steinhardt's
grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, neither
Steinhardt nor his attorney will comment on the case. Although U.S.
authorities have filed no criminal charges against Steinhardt, he
stands to lose the bowl and the $1.2 million he paid for it. The
unauthorized export of Italian antiquities is illegal, and the
courts found that the Customs declaration filed when the bowl was
brought into the United States was falsified.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has taken action of its own. Italian police have arrested
two men who played key roles in the case. They say Giacomo
Manganaro, a professor of ancient history in Sicily, and Vincenzo
Cammarata, a Sicilian coin dealer, were part of a major looting and
smuggling ring with ties to the Mafia. A raid by Italy's art theft
squad netted six alleged conspirators and 30,000 Phoenician, Greek
and Roman artifacts, valued at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Italian investigators say Manganaro, who was asked to
authenticate the bowl in 1980, was told that it had been dug up
near Caltavuturo, Sicily, by an electric utility crew. An
inscription along the edge of the bowl elaborately decorated with
concentric rings of acorns, beechnuts and honeybees is written in a
dialect of Doric Greek spoken in the colonies of ancient Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   But like most looted antiquities, the origins of the phiale _
and clues about the people who used it _ will probably always be a
mystery. And that, archaeologists say, is a loss that transcends
whatever monetary value the market assigns to it. The cumulative
loss to history, however, must be multiplied by the thousands of
illicit artifacts entering the market each year.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that Cammarata acquired the phiale from the
local antique dealer, paying for it with $20,000 worth of artworks.
Eventually, he showed a photo of it to Swiss art dealer William
Veres. Veres brought the bowl to the attention of Robert Haber, an
American art dealer. And Haber told Steinhardt it was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, with Haber as intermediary, offered $1.2 million for
the bowl, plus Haber's $162,000 commission. A one-page ``terms of
the sale'' specified that Manganaro, the Sicilian professor, would
provide a letter stating that he had seen the phiale 15 years
earlier in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the payment was wired to Veres' bank account
on Dec. 6, 1991. From that point, things moved swiftly. Four days
later, Haber flew from New York to Zurich, and then drove across
the Alps to Lugano, Switzerland, near the Italian border. On Dec.
12, he took possession of the bowl from Veres, who by then had paid
the Sicilians $90,000 for it.
</P>
<P>
   With the phiale in his luggage, Haber retraced his route _
Lugano to Zurich to New York. On arrival at Kennedy International
Airport on Dec. 13, the phiale was declared as ``one gold bowl ...
value $250,000.'' Because the country of origin was listed as
Switzerland, which does not bar the export of antiquities, he
wasn't challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, who got the Metropolitan Museum of Art to
authenticate the bowl, insists that he knew only that the seller
was ``a Sicilian coin dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinhardt was eager to know as little as possible about the
source of the phiale,'' says Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Barr, who
prosecuted the case. ``Steinhardt's lack of interest in the
particulars of the transaction is all the more disturbing in light
of his sophistication in dealing with the art market, having
purchased millions of dollars worth of antiquities, paintings and
other works of art from Haber and other dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Italian government learned about the phiale in the
1990s, apparently from Sicilian sources, it was displayed
prominently in Steinhardt's apartment. Then, in 1995, U.S. Customs
agents seized it and took it to the New York Customs vault, where
it has been ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its compelling chronology, the Steinhardt case
underscores several key aspects of the global antiquities market:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Illicitly obtained antiquities are seldom detected entering
the United States. ``We only examine 10 percent of the passengers
and cargo coming into New York,'' says U.S. Customs Special Agent
in Charge John Varrone. ``Most of the material we seize is
recovered only after it's in this country, often when someone
reports seeing something in a catalog or a display room.'' Even
though two-thirds of the art imported into the United States comes
through New York, customs officials there usually report only two
or three such seizures a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Switzerland is to the antiquities trade what the Cayman
Islands are to drug money. ``It's well-known that Switzerland is a
hub for both the legal and illegal activity in the antiquities
market,'' says Andrea Rascher, deputy director of the Swiss Office
for Culture, the agency that promotes and protects cultural
heritage. ``It's like money laundering. Because we have no import
or export restrictions, cultural goods are frequently brought to
Switzerland and allowed to cool down for a few years in Geneva or
Zurich. Storage in duty-free ports makes it easy to prevent their
discovery. Then it's off to New York, London or Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When it comes to black market antiquities, rewards seldom
accrue to the finder. Although Steinhardt paid $1.2 million for the
phiale, the money trail began when it sold in Italy for a mere
$20,000. ``The simple truth of the illicit trade in antiquities is
that there are large sums of money to be made, more than by
legitimate trading, and that very little of the proceeds ever
reaches the original funders,'' says Neil Brodie of the University
of Cambridge's Illicit Antiquities Research Centre in England,
which monitors the antiquities market.
</P>
<P>
   As highly charged as the Steinhardt case has been, the storm of
controversy over its implications for the global trade in
antiquities is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   New York art dealers and the American Association of Museums,
which entered the case on Steinhardt's side, view Italy's actions
as a threat not only to the art market, but to the holdings of many
major museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no interest in helping Mr. Steinhardt,'' says Edward
Able, association president. ``We abhor the looting and the illegal
export of cultural material, but we didn't want to see a precedent
set that could permit the looting of material now held in American
museums.'' Able says Italy never proved that the phiale was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Although reputable collectors shun stolen art, the Steinhardt
ruling tends to support the premise that, in countries where buried
artifacts are considered the nation's cultural property, anything
dug up illegally can be considered stolen, too. Since 1939, the
unauthorized export of Italian antiquities has been illegal.
Greece, Turkey, Egypt and dozens of other countries have similar
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Because U.S. common law holds that no buyer can acquire valid
title to stolen property, the Steinhardt case has shaken up the art
world. Applied across the board, it could put many private
collections at risk. Italy is considering legal action to recover a
collection of Sicilian silver held by the Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high cost of suing _ and the difficulty in proving
that, say, a Greek bowl such as the phiale really did come from
Italy _ source countries aren't likely to become wholesale raiders
of the lost arts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Archaeological Institute of America, the nation's
leading organization of professional archaeologists, which entered
the Steinhardt case on the side of the U.S. and Italian
governments, says the decision could help deter the epidemic of
looting _ spurred by market demand _ that is destroying many
archaeological sites before they can be studied.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the dispute doesn't leave much room for middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A price-driven international market
</P>
<P>
   Like the phiale, most of the ancient art in the world today was
once someone's booty. Looting was decried in an ancient Egyptian
papyrus in 134 B.C. The Romans sacked Greece. The Spanish pillaged
Mexico. The British plundered Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Only in this century, however, have legions of collectors
created a price-driven international market for such goods. And
only recently have looted countries become concerned about the way
in which their own cultures have been scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times when some of the world's important works of art were
threatened, collectors have saved them so they could be appreciated
by future generations,'' says Fred Schultz, owner of a prominent
New York gallery and president of the National Association of
Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art. ``All we are doing
is rescuing the bits of a country's culture that fall by the
wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that looters are destroying the history of
some countries, but collectors are not responsible for the looting.
It is looters who are responsible. Countries that don't enforce
their own laws are responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But antiquities are also subject to the law of supply and
demand. And because, in a world of 6 billion people, no one is
making new antiquities, increased demand inevitably creates a need
for more material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auction houses are doing more business every year,'' says
DePaul University law professor Patty Gerstenblith, editor of the
International Journal of Cultural Property, which reviews cultural
law and policy issues. ``If you accept that the number of existing
collections is limited, you have to accept that much of what is
being bought and sold on the market is new _ and therefore
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Art dealers and archaeologists may differ about the cause of the
problem, but the consequences are readily visible in the moonscapes
of looters' pits, ransacked tombs and defaced monuments in scores
of countries. The United States, where entire Indian pueblos have
been bulldozed to ``harvest'' artifacts, is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation we face today is not unlike the effort to keep
whales, elephants and the rhino from extinction,'' says Manus
Brinkman, secretary-general of the International Council of Museums
in Paris, which is working to curb the trade in illicit
antiquities. ``History is being erased before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many connoisseurs of antiquities would be appalled to think that
their love for ancient art might be destroying evidence of the
cultures that created it. In a number of cases, however,
uncontrolled looting has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists wish, for instance, that they knew more about the
Olmec, the mother culture of Central America, which built
sophisticated urban centers across western Mexico between 1500 B.C.
and 400 B.C. Olmec culture was first widely recognized in the
1940s. Political problems in Mexico delayed scientific study, but
not the looting. Olmec stone monuments and breathtaking jade masks,
some selling for $100,000 or more, quickly became popular items in
the art centers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time archaeologists got around to studying the Olmec,
many sites had been looted or destroyed,'' says University of
Alabama anthropologist Richard Diehl, an authority on Olmec art.
``These people left no written history, so most of our knowledge of
the culture is now based on objects that are scattered throughout
the world without any record of where they came from or how they
were found.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate befell the Bronze Age settlements of the Aegean
Sea. In the 1960s, the popularity of the abstractionist marble
statues produced by the Cycladic culture triggered a wave of
looting in the Aegean Islands. Today, archaeologists estimate that
as many as 12,000 Cycladic graves _ 85 percent of those known _
were destroyed in the frenzied looting. In the vacuum of knowledge,
fakes abound.

<P>
   UNDATED: knowledge, fakes abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more Cycladic figures in New York today
than anywhere else in the world,'' says Christopher Chippindale, a
curator of the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology. ``But so few were ever recovered in an archaeological
context, it's virtually impossible to know which are genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most high-end items are sold privately, the market for
ancient art can only be estimated. But if public sales at major
auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's are any measure, the
demand is robust. The most recent antiquities auctions, in June,
drew standing-room-only crowds at both firms. In two days, they
sold $10 million worth of ancient art, topped by the sale of a
4.5-inch-high Elamite figure _ a 3,000-year-old stone carving from
Iran that sold at Sotheby's for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the diminutive figurine had been on loan to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1985, its recent history was a
matter of record. But detailed pedigrees are the exception. Many
items in auction catalogs carry only vague references to ownership
_ ``property of an American private collection'' _ or sometimes
nothing at all. The anonymity of seller as well as buyer is
something all auction houses honor as a sacred trust.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the information is missing because the seller doesn't
know. Sometimes, like Steinhardt, neither the auction house nor its
customers want to know too much. Reputable dealers routinely check
law enforcement agencies and electronic databases of stolen art to
help them avoid ``hot'' material. But looted items are not so
easily identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic policy is that we won't sell anything that we know
has been illegally excavated,'' says Rena Moulopoulos, the attorney
who heads Sotheby's compliance division, which is charged with
ensuring the legitimacy of objects it offers for sale. ``If a
seller warrants that an object is legally and ethically acquired,
then we treat it as legitimate and we can sell it. This is not a
science and we are not detectives. We try to avoid anything that
has been recently looted, but we're not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the presumption of legitimacy, in the absence of
proof to the contrary, merely encourages the sale of illicitly
obtained antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My surveys of auction houses and independent collections show
that about 80 percent of the items turn up without explanations of
where they came from or how they got there,'' says Chippindale.
``The usual story is that they came from an old European
collection, but there just aren't that many old collections.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethics, treaties used to fight illicit trade
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, the FBI, Scotland Yard and other institutions all keep
detailed records of stolen objects. The largest database,
maintained by the London-based Art Loss Register, lists more than
100,000 stolen items. Since 1991, the organization, funded largely
by the insurance industry, has helped recover $75 million worth of
stolen art.
</P>
<P>
   Looted objects are another matter. No private owner has been
wronged. No insurance company wants restitution. Most looted
material is never reported missing, so there is no central listing
or guidance, only the ethics of the buyer _ and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stopped dealing in pre-Columbian material,'' says
Jerome Eisenberg, owner of the Royal-Athena Galleries on East 57th
Street in New York. ``Ninety percent of the material that has been
brought out of South and Central America in recent years is
illegal. It's a shame. For anyone with a sense of ethics, it is
hard to deal in pre-Columbian.''
</P>
<P>
   But no country's artifacts are above suspicion. Last year,
Eisenberg returned a $30,000 Greek amphora after the original owner
notified him it had been stolen from a French villa in 1981.
Eisenberg was miffed. He had purchased the vase at a Christie's of
London auction just months before. And it had been sold before at
Sotheby's in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate records of previous owners and an object's movement
across borders could help distinguish legal pieces, but dealers say
a system of passports for antiquities would be futile. The
falsified papers for the phiale are a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly obvious that everything on the market isn't
coming from old collections,'' says Schultz. ``But having a piece
of paper saying something is from an existing collection isn't the
answer. People make up collection histories. There are a lot of
clever ways of doing it. It's easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal efforts to curb illicit traffic depend on a patchwork of
international treaties and mismatched national laws that often pit
antiquity-rich countries of the world against art-hungry consumers
in the United States, Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The key treaty, the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization's convention on cultural property, has
been signed by 89 countries, but it can't be invoked in many
countries that are destinations for looted antiquities. Key nations
at the crossroads of the antiquities trade _ including the United
Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands _ haven't signed
it. The United States ratified the treaty in 1983 only after a
bitter congressional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law implementing the treaty in the United States was so
weakened by opposition from art dealers and museums that individual
agreements between the United States and each country seeking
protection have been necessary to make it work,'' says David
Walden, chairman of UNESCO's Committee for the Return of Cultural
Property.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the United States has concluded pacts for the return
of illegally exported artifacts with just seven countries. Two of
those agreements _ with Canada and Peru _ are under challenge by
the nation's art dealers. In all, there have been fewer than a
dozen U.S. seizures of stolen or looted property.
</P>
<P>
   A second treaty designed to aid in the recovery of looted or
stolen antiquities primarily in Europe, where property laws differ,
has been ratified by only one-third of the 22 nations that signed
it in 1996. The United States is not a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient with the pace of international efforts, some countries
have been taking matters into their own hands _ seeking their own
remedies in the U.S. courts, as Italy did with the golden phiale.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, billionaire William Koch ended a decade-long legal
battle with the government of Turkey over ownership of the Elmali
Hoard _ a $2 million collection of ancient silver coins that he
acquired in the late 1980s. Koch, an avid coin collector as well as
the skipper of the winning yacht in the 1992 America's Cup, had
acquired the 2,400-year-old coins at auction. Investigators showed
that they had been unearthed by Turkish villagers in the mid-1980s
and smuggled to the United States by way of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the civil trial, Koch surrendered the coins in
exchange for a medal from the Turkish government thanking him for
``safeguarding'' the coins for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey will continue its vigorous efforts around the world,
not only to recover the rest of the Elmali Hoard, but other stolen
antiquities,'' says Larry Kaye, a New York attorney who represents
Turkish interests in cases involving disputed antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye says the message should be clear to anyone buying ancient
art. Like the game of hot potato, the last person caught holding
illegally obtained goods _ whether they were stolen or looted _ may
get burned.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    A world of trouble: Where looting is rampant
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTARCTICA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Tools, supplies and artifacts left by the
continent's first explorers in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The threat: ``Souveniring'' past and present; a budding market
for artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The theft of artifacts is prohibited by treaty, with
some items being returned.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest, driest, most remote continent. In Antarctica,
human history is barely a century old. Yet for half that time,
looters and souvenir hunters have been chipping away its meager
cultural heritage _ pilfering what was left by explorers who
departed the frozen continent or died there.
</P>
<P>
   This year, British and New Zealand authorities rescued three
items _ a lantern, a dog harness and a coat hook _ about to be
auctioned at Christie's in London. Taken more than 40 years ago,
they were returned to the weather-beaten wooden hut at Cape Evans
once occupied by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, hundreds, perhaps thousands of items have been
taken from these sites,'' says David Crerer, chairman of New
Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust. ``We estimate that as many as
50 percent of the artifacts left by the early explorers are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the shores of the Ross Sea, dozens of old huts and supply
depots stand in mute testimony to the dawn of Antarctic exploration
in the early 1900s. Thanks to the cold, dry climate, many look as
if the owners had just stepped away. At Cape Evans, the carcasses
of sled dogs lie frozen. At Cape Royds, tins of biscuits and other
ship's stores still line the shelves once used by Ernest
Shakleton's crew.
</P>
<P>
   As sites in Antarctica have been stripped, New Zealand, whose
territory includes dozens of historic sites, has grown more
protective. These days, the huts are locked _ and the growing
number of tour groups are allowed in the huts only under
supervision. Only last year did the Antarctic Treaty Organization,
which includes the U.S., make removal of such items illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, ``souveniring'' was widely tolerated. The items
about to be sold were collected this year before such activity
became illegal. ``The items weren't so important by themselves,''
says Crerar. ``But we did not want to see a market established for
such items.'' If monetary values ever get assigned to Scott era
items, the danger to these sites would be greatly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Crerar's hopes suffered a setback on Friday, when Christie's
auctioned off $800,000 worth of Antarctic memorabilia. A few items,
including the flag Scott flew at the pole, were purchased in
advance by a Britsh museum, but most of the items, owned by
descendents of the explorers, were sold to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: More than 1,000 sites (Stone Age to Ming Dynasty,
A.D. 1600) on Yangzi River.
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Looting spurred by reservoir construction for the
Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: It's too late for many sites; archaeologists are trying
to make the best of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   China's Three Gorges Dam _ the largest hydroelectric project
ever attempted _ will allow ocean-going ships to travel 1,500 miles
inland. It will also displace more than 1.5 million people and
destroy 400 towns and villages, as well as obliterate 3,000 years
of Chinese history in 1,000 archaeological sites along the river
and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   The central government has promised professional excavations to
save the region's most impressive sites, like the caves of Dazu,
which hold a half-million stone sculptures from the 400-year span
of time from the Tang to the Ming dynasties. But archaeologists say
culturally important sites are still being lost _ such as those of
the Stone Age Ba people, who occupied the area before it was part
of China.
</P>
<P>
   China has declined help from archaeologists outside the country.
In desperation, some Chinese archaeologists are borrowing money to
finance their own digs.
</P>
<P>
   China's looters aren't waiting. Grave robbers, black marketers
and smugglers _ some equipped with cellular phones and two-way
radios _ have descended on the region. Not all of the looting is so
organized. At Fengjie, a county town on the Yangzi, dynamiting and
bulldozing by construction crews exposed more than 1,000 tombs,
touching off a frenzy of looting.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists say poverty provides a powerful incentive for
looters, but the demand for Chinese antiquities is also a major
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art and artifact smuggling out of China is a major basis for
western collections,'' says Zou Heng, professor of archaeology at
Peking University. ``In some places, hundreds of looters work day
and night. Dealers set up shop in nearby villages to buy artifacts,
which were then smuggled into Hong Kong, and then into the
international market _ dispersed to Japan, Thailand and throughout
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What has passed through New York, London and Berlin in the
last few years would fill a great museum,'' says Jerome Eisenberg,
owner of the Royal Athena Galley in New York. ``I went to China in
1994 to produce guides to the country's major archaeological sites.
Now I'm seeing the same material showing up on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular artifact to come out of China in recent
years was a 4-foot bronze ``spirit tree'' candelabra from the Han
Dynasty _ sold for $2.5 million last year at the International
Asian Art Fair in New York. Archaeologists say it may be the same
piece reportedly unearthed in the Three Gorges region the year
before and quickly sold on the black market for about $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Written records of classic Mayan civilization (A.D.
250 -1500).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Looters have stripped stone monuments from more than
300 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: As large carvings are depleted, looters are taking
smaller artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the world's leading Mayanists, Ian Graham has seen the
most remote corners of the Central American jungle. But in his
40-year quest to document the Mayan equivalent of hieroglyphics,
the 77-year-old archaeologist has made a discouraging number of his
discoveries in museums and private collections in Fort Worth, San
Diego, Cleveland, New York, Budapest and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working in Guatemala in the '60s, almost
everything was intact. Now, virtually all of the sculpture is
gone,'' says Graham, director of the Maya Corpus Program at Harvard
University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being able to study these inscriptions intact, they
have been cut into pieces and sold to people who only think of them
as trophies or tax deductions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Victories are few, but sweet. In August, Graham learned that a
collector was planning to sell part of a Mayan stone carving.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the masked human figure as a piece stolen from
northern Guatemala in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Customs agents and attorneys for the Guatemalan
government came calling, the collector agreed to surrender the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Even armed guards and double-locked gates at archaeological
sites have failed to deter the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looting and smuggling of artifacts is a major industry,'' says
Richard Hansen, a California archaeologist who has worked
extensively in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Peten, hundreds of sites have been totally overrun. It's
like trying to ward off hordes of ants.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanses says soaring prices for Mayan pottery is fueling the
frenzy. ``A single polychrome Codex pot can bring a Guatemalan
peasant $1,000,'' he says. ``Get it to Guatemala City and it takes
a dramatic jump. Smuggled to the United States or Japan, it can
fetch $100,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Stone reliefs, artifacts from world's oldest
civilizations (2000- 600 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: United Nations sanctions, post-war problems leave
remote desert sites open to looters.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Internal control is improving, but remote borders are
still open to smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is the
cradle of civilization, the home to ancient Sumeria, Assyria and
Babylonia. Since the Persian Gulf War and the imposition of
international sanctions, looters have been robbing the cradle _ and
its graves _ with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illicit digging for antiquities, especially in desert areas of
Iraq, has increased dramatically,'' says McGuire Gibson, a
University of Chicago archaeologist who specializes in the Middle
East. ``Gangs of up to 100 people work some sites, using
earthmoving equipment to open up the ruins. Large groups of stone
tablets and statues are being smuggled out along traditional
smuggling routes to Iran, through Kurdish northern Iraq, and from
there to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations sanctions have squeezed the country's economy to
the point that Iraq can't halt looting internally, and it gets
little help when stolen goods turn up elsewhere. A rare exception
was Jordan's seizure in July of more than 1,000 Iraqi artifacts _
cuneiform tablets, cylinder seals and a Sumerian stone statue more
than 4,000 years old _ being smuggled out on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Pillage is nothing new in the Iraqi countryside. Nor is the
Western world's interest in the cultures that thrived there from
the 4th millennium B.C. In 1994, one Assyrian wall panel sold at
auction for $11.8 million _ the highest price ever paid for any
antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's rich and varied heritage has been coveted by the
Western world since the 19th century heyday of imperial
acquisition,'' says John Malcolm Russell, archaeologist and art
historian at the Massachusetts College of Art. ``Back then,
European governments descended on the palaces of Mesopotamia and
sacked them to fill the halls of the British Museum, the Louvre and
the Berlin Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the mid-1990s, the problem has been the illicit art
market. At least 13 wall panels from the great Assyrian capital of
Nineveh and the palace at Nimrud have appeared for sale in London,
Brussels and other cities. So far no one has been arrested and none
of the panels have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Nations sanctions have finally finished the work begun
by the ancient Medes and Babylonians, who sacked Nineveh in 612
B.C,'' Russell says. ``A lot of people say the Iraqis got what's
coming to them. But this is not merely Iraq's problem. The people
of ancient Iraq influenced the way we speak and write and do
business today. This culture belongs to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Hundreds of temple sites built by the Khmer Empire
(A.D. 500-1400).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Gangs of looters are stripping temples of stone
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Dismal. Cambodian government is unable to guard many
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lost, found and lost again in the jungles of Southeast Asia, the
ruins of Angkor Wat and other walled temples of the Khmer Empire
have endured centuries of neglect, conflict and the horrors of
Cambodia's killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Peace has not been so kind. Cambodia's ancient architecture is
being dismembered to feed a growing market for Khmer art and
artifacts. The crisis was highlighted this year when Thai police
intercepted a truck bound for Bangkok with 117 sandstone carvings _
estimated market value: $2 million _ which had been hacked off the
wall of a 12th century temple in northwest Cambodia. Investigators
say elements of the Cambodian army spent four weeks chiseling and
cutting the sculptures from the wall. So many were removed that a
40-foot section of the inner wall collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian police this year also found 40 tons of ancient statues
and carvings hidden near the jungle headquarters of former Khmer
Rouge leader Ta Mok. ``On a recent visit to Thailand, I had a
dealer show me pictures of sandstone panels _ still on the temple
walls _ that he said he could obtain for me,'' says John Stubbs,
vice president of the World Monuments Fund, which works to protect
Cambodian sites. ``He was, in effect, offering to loot them to
order.''
</P>
<P>
   In another big haul in July, Thai police seized eight tons of
Cambodian artifacts _ 29 cases of Hindu and Buddhist sculptures _
being smuggled in from Singapore. Later, they seized another 110
Cambodian artifacts on sale in a Bangkok shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian authorities have vowed to crack down. Looters have
been warned that they will be shot on sight. But with 400 police
guarding Angkor Wat, the country's most famous temple complex, the
country doesn't have the resources to protect its more than 1,000
temple sites.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    ONLINE BIDDING: NEW DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY
 &HT;    Online bidding: A new demand on same supply
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ THE MOOD IS TENSE. Bidding on the gray-green Mayan
jade mask is rising in $5,000 increments and auctioneer C. Hugh
Hildesley is quick to move the bidding upward with sharp raps of
his ivory gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 people are on the auction floor of Sotheby's for the
firm's semi-annual sale of pre-Columbian art. The handful bidding
on Lot 165 signal with a nod or the muted wave of blue-and-white
numbered paddles.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders on the floor, however, are soon outclassed as the action
shifts to Sotheby's 12 phone lines, where company representatives
are bidding for clients on three continents. Above the floor, a
tote board flashes the escalating bids in dollars, francs, marks,
pesos and pesetas. In less than three minutes, the board reads
$325,000 and only two bidders remain.
</P>
<P>
   A Sotheby's specialist queries her client on the other end of
the line in Spanish and nods. The bid is $330,000. Hildesley takes
a sip of Evian and looks to the other phone. A long silence, then a
shake of the head. The gavel seals the deal. The 2,100-year-old
mask, previously owned by an anonymous New York collector, has just
been sold to an equally anonymous bidder in Europe. Final price,
including the buyer's premium: $365,500.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been at Sotheby's since 1744, when London bookseller
Samuel Baker founded what would become one of the world's premier
venues for the sale of art, antiquities and other collectibles _
from rare baseball memorabilia to $78 million Renoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Sotheby's will launch a new venture that it hopes
will revolutionize the auction business. Sotheby's is moving into
cyberspace _ a move that has the art world buzzing and
archaeologists uneasy about the impact that the millions of
potential new buyers could have on the global demand for
antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's first online sale _ a follow-up to the Sept. 23-29
live auction of baseball memorabilia _ isn't expected until later
this fall, but the firm has already lined up 3,200 dealers
worldwide to provide material for future sales, a roster that will
make it a global clearinghouse for collectibles of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its high visibility, Sotheby's now draws only about
100,000 buyers and sellers a year to its auctions. Executive Vice
President David Redden says Sothebys.com wants as many of the
estimated 100 million Internet users as it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are uncomfortable or shy about coming into the
showroom and bidding at a live auction,'' says Sotheby's Executive
Vice President David Redden. ``But we don't think they will feel
shy about shopping in their bedroom slippers in the privacy of
their own homes. They will be able to rummage through the world for
things to buy. The potential for reaching huge numbers of people is
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of online auctions and artifact sales is an
unfortunate development,'' says Ellen Herscher, chairman of the
Archaeological Institute of America's cultural property committee.
``The demand for such things has always been a very specialized
market. This broadens it in a way that can only create greater
demand, at a time when there is already a big rise in demand for
classical antiquities.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the burgeoning online market for artifacts _ and the
questions it poses _ can be seen at two popular Internet auction
sites: eBa, which recently bought the prestigious West Coast
auction house, Butterfield and Butterfield, and Amazon.com, which
has taken a $10 million stake in Sotheby's. Amazon plans to share
an auction site with Sotheby's, but currently operates two auction
sites of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two online giants lure 20 million visitors a month
to their Web sites. Although items for sale range from used
computers to old Pez dispensers, the number of artifacts, American
as well as international, has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day, eBay offered a total of 1,338 items under the
heading of ``Native Americana, artifacts'' _ ranging from a
1,000-year-old Anasazi cameo bowl (minimum bid $500) from Arizona
to a 3.25-inch arrowhead (minimum bid $70) which the owner ``found
last year in the Flint River a few miles above Albany, Ga.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former federal prosecutor for the eastern district of
Virginia, eBay's associate general counsel, Robert Chestnut, is
aware that people may be using the online auction site to buy and
sell illegal artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have removed some things from the site already: Native
American remains, burial goods and ritual objects,'' Chestnut says.
``But we have more than 300,000 items posted every day in over
1,000 categories from chintz china to Beanie Babies. We can't
review everything that is offered for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The items eBay sells are of the sort and price typical of flea
markets and artifact shows. Because they are online, however, buyer
and seller complete their transaction without ever meeting, or even
knowing each other's names.
</P>
<P>
   `We don't tolerate fraud, but ...'
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon.com's auctions, the artifacts tend to be pricier and
more international in flavor. In one recent sale, Web surfers could
choose from a 1,650-year-old Roman jug from Lebanon (reserve price
of $125), a pair of Mexican Nayarit figurines ($2,500) and a
Peruvian head vessel with stirrup handle ($335).
</P>
<P>
   Were the items legally exported from the country of origin?
Amazon officials are frank about their inability to assure buyers
that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate fraud, but buying online is no different
than buying anywhere else,'' says Sharon Greenspan, spokeswoman for
the company. ``You still have to buy from a reputable dealer and
you have to educate yourself. We encourage everybody to be smart
shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other Internet sites, however, offer direct,
person-to-person sales of a wide variety of artifacts, ranging from
Civil War belt buckles to Neanderthal skulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating a growing number of Internet-related
cases, a number of which involve the sale of human body parts,''
says John Fryar, criminal investigator for the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs in Santa Fe, N.M. ``There is definitely increased
interest, and at least the potential for a lot more illegal
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has made it easy to put stuff on the black
market, but in some ways it has also made it easier for us to track
it. Until recently no one was watching these auction sites. Now we
have people who call us when they see something suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's hopes its entry into the world of sales will bring a
level of trust and integrity to the wild and woolly frontier of
cyberspace. Although Redden says the firm intends to offer items
for sale in ``every collecting category,'' he says plans for the
sale of ancient art are proceeding with ``some caution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to issues of authenticity and condition, we
obviously have to be concerned about export laws,'' he says. ``We
have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has vowed to guarantee the condition and authenticity
of all of the material it offers for sale online. But any assurance
that artifacts have been legally removed from their countries of
origin would likely continue to depend, as is the case at live
auctions now, on the say-so of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Sotheby's officials believe, the prestige of the firm _
and the thousands of dealers from which it will take consignments _
will foster a thriving market in high-end art at price levels seen

   ``It's still a little hard to imagine a major sale of
impressionist paintings on the Net, but we don't know what the
upper limit will be,'' says Redden. ``I had once thought that
$10,000 might be the upper limit, but now I'm not so sure. Even
interactive bidders have certain gladiatorial instincts when it
comes to bidding.''

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    Georgia theft robs world of unique legacy
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGIA'S HOT POTS just keep popping up. A quarter-century after
thieves cleaned out the little museum at Kolomoki Mounds State
Park, near Blakely, the state's most famous stolen pots are still
showing up in out-of-the-way places. Each new sighting offers a
fleeting glimpse of the black market in American antiquities and
new hope that more of the 1,500-year-old pots will someday be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Although the missing Kolomoki artifacts never dazzled like
pre-Columbian gold or Etruscan silver, the intricately shaped clay
bowls and figurines are, even in absentia, among the most revered
relics of ancient Georgia and its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were some of the most fantastic items created in
Georgia's prehistory,'' says Frank Snell, archaeologist for the
nearby Columbus Museum. ``The loss of these objects is tragic. A
photograph can't begin to show what they are like. I'd give my
eyeteeth to see them all returned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the crime was widely reported. Sometime between
March 3 and March 7, 1974, someone broke into the park-operated
museum housing the artifacts from Georgia's oldest ceremonial mound
complex _ a cluster of flat-topped pyramid-like structures built
more than 1,000 years ago. The thieves stole 129 items, including a
dozen rare effigy vessels, a large collection of clay bowls, 20
stone axes and several dozen arrowheads.
</P>
<P>
   The street value of the stolen artifacts was estimated at
$400,000. The impact on the park museum was swift. With virtually
nothing left to display, it closed.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to history was far greater. The stolen artifacts
represented a substantial share _ a third or more _ of the world's
known objects from the Weeden Island culture, which inhabited North
Florida and South Georgia between A.D. 300 and 800. At Kolomoki,
they built at least seven earthen mounds _ the tallest 56 feet high
_ several centuries before the construction of Georgia's better
known prehistoric mound complexes at Etowah and Ocmulgee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Kolomoki have no known living descendants,''
says Larry Blakenship, former manager of the park. ``So the only
way we had to learn about these people is to study the artifacts
they left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, ironically, the distinctive style of Kolomoki's ancient
artisans _ complex patterns of stylistic incising and stippled cuts
in clay, along with a penchant for elaborate animal effigies _ that
has made it harder for them to disappear than most stolen
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Georgia and Florida law enforcement officials seized 12
of the pots at the home of an amateur archaeologist in North Miami.
Unaware that they were stolen, the collector had acquired them at a
Miami Beach rock and gem show in exchange for a collection of
antique bottles. Police traced the seller as far as Tallahassee,
but there the trail went cold.
</P>
<P>
   The pots were returned to Kolomoki for safekeeping, but had to
be stored in a cell at the Early County Jail until Georgia could
build a more secure museum.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more. In 1979, Frank Morast, a collector in
Columbus, identified a Kolomoki pot at an artifact show in
Pennsylvania. He bought it and donated it to the park museum. No
one ever learned how it got to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent recoveries suggest that by now Kolomoki's
missing treasures have changed hands so many times that some of the
current owners don't have a clue about the cultural importance of
the pots _ and may not even suspect that they are part of the loot
from Georgia's most notorious antiquities theft.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Cordell, staff archaeologist for the Florida Museum of
Natural History in Gainesville, Fla., remembers her astonishment
one day in 1996 when a local taxidermist showed her pictures of two
pots _ carefully crafted effigies of a wood duck and a quail in the
Weeden Island style _ that he was thinking about buying from a
collector in St. Petersburg. The collector wanted $300 for the
pair. The taxidermist wanted to know if Cordell thought they were
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell thought the pots _ one buff-colored and the other a dull
red _ looked uncannily familiar. A trip to the reference shelf
enabled her to make a positive ID. Pictures of the very pots which
at that moment graced the living room mantle of Thomas Duddy of St.
Petersburg were listed as vessel 2 and vessel 18 in the 1953 report
``Excavations at Kolomoki by archaeologist William H. Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordell would eventually examine the pots herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mend marks _ the seams where they were glued together _
made it clear they were the exact same pots,'' she says. ``And when
I shined a flashlight inside, I could see the ID numbers put there
by the excavators nearly 50 years before.''
</P>
<P>
   No reward for state's missing treasures
</P>
<P>
   As the unsuspecting owner of stolen property, Duddy was more
than happy to cooperate with authorities. He just wanted to be rid
of the pots, which he had by this time owned for a number of years,
unaware that they were anything but curiously ``primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duddy had been given the pots by his mother. Questioned by
authorities, she recalled buying them for her son at a flea market
in nearby Gulfport, Fla., in 1987. She paid $45 for the pair, which
experts agree could have sold elsewhere for hundreds. And there, as
it had so many times before, the trail of Kolomoki's hot pots went
cold again.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for yet another pot to turn up. The Florida
taxidermist who had been interested in buying Duddy's pots checked
his own collection and, to his surprise, discovered that he had
another Kolomoki pot, the effigy of an owl, that had been in his
collection for years. He voluntarily turned it over to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 of the stolen pots have been found and returned to
Kolomoki, where they now occupy a cherished place in the display
case of a new museum _ with improved security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cultural significance of the Kolomoki artifacts
Georgia has never made the recovery of Kolomoki's missing treasures
a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   None of the missing pots has ever been seized in the state of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   No reward has ever been offered for their return.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever been arrested for the theft. Given the time that
has elapsed since the burglary, arrests are now unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black market in artifacts is really secretive,'' says
Blakenship. ``We still investigate one or two leads a year, but I
think the pieces are probably well scattered, and by now the trail
is pretty cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Department of Natural Resources has never directly
enlisted the public in tracing the stolen artifacts, despite
suggestions by archaeologists that the state try to flush the
missing pots into the open by publishing ``wanted'' posters or
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still thinking about it,'' says Townsend. ``We hope we
might get some of them printed this year yet.''

 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    The 20-year odyssey of a golden greek bowl
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   History:
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented in the modern world until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   1980
</P>
<P>
   Sicilian antique collector Vincenzo Pappalardo asks Giacamo
Manganaro, a professor of Greek history, to authenticate a
ceremonial gold bowl, a phiale. Pappalardo claims it was unearthed
by workers digging up electrical lines near Catania, Sicily, on the
site of an ancient Greek settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mid- to late 1980s
</P>
<P>
   Pappalardo trades the phiale to Vincenzo Cammarata, a Sicilian
coin dealer, for artworks valued at $20,000. Cammarata shows the
phiale to William Veres, a Zurich art dealer and specialist in
antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   November 1991
</P>
<P>
   Veres brings the phiale to the attention of Robert Haber, an
American art dealer. Haber travels to Sicily to examine the phiale.
He informs Wall Street financier Michael Steinhardt that the phiale
is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   December 1991
</P>
<P>
   Veres acquires the phiale from Cammarata for objects worth
$90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 4, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, with Haber acting as intermediary, agrees to pay
Veres $1.2 million for the phiale.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber flies to Zurich and then travels to Lugano, Switzerland on
the Italian border to meet Veres.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 12, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber takes possession of the phiale from Veres and returns to
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber lands at JFK International Airport with the phiale in his
luggage. The customs declaration puts its value as $250,000. It is
identified as coming from a private collection in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 6, 1991
</P>
<P>
   Haber has the phiale authenticated by the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, which acquired a similar bowl from art dealer Robert Hecht in
1962. The Met declares Steinhardt's phiale to be as authentic as
its own.
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt displays the phiale in the drawing room of his New
York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   1995
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government asks the United States to help recover
the phiale, which it deems, under the country's national patrimony
law, to have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 9, 1995
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents seize the phiale from Steinhardt's Fifth
Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14, 1997
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court in New York orders forfeiture of the phiale
and its return to Italy. Steinhardt appeals.
</P>
<P>
   December 1998
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities arrest six people in Sicily _ including
Manganaro and Cammarata _ for alleged participation in an
antiquities looting ring linked to the Mafia. Authorities
confiscate more than 10,000 artifacts, valued at more than $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   July 12, 1999
</P>
<P>
   After hearing briefs from the American Association of Museums,
on behalf of Steinhardt, and from the Archaeological Institute of
America on behalf of the U.S. government, the U.S. Court of Appeals
reaffirms the forfeiture.

 &HT;    Buying, selling, stealing history
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE GOLDEN PHIALE OF ACHYRIS may soon be winging its way home to
Italy _ the last leg of a decade-long odyssey that has spanned the
cultural divide between an antiquities smuggling ring in rural
Sicily and the Fifth Avenue apartment of a Wall Street financier.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after U.S. Customs agents seized the 2,400-year-old
bowl from the home of hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, a U.S.
appellate court has affirmed that the 24-karat treasure was
illegally imported into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The courts say Italy, not Steinhardt, is the rightful owner.
Antiquities dealers say the decision could cripple the thriving
trade in ancient art. Archaeologists say it's a milestone in the
effort to protect the world's eroding cultural heritage. Italy just
hopes the phiale's return will send a message to collectors as old
as antiquity itself: Let the buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt's star status on Wall Street and the $1.2 million
price he paid for the phiale guaranteed a high profile for the case
from the beginning. But in a legal arena where art and archaeology
are often at loggerheads, the case has become a cause celebre for
another reason. The shallow bowl, which once held ancient Greeks'
offerings to the gods, has served up a rare, revealing glimpse of
the international antiquities market in action.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, shipping crates and suitcases full of ancient art
and artifacts _ large and small, legal and illegal _ spill across
the porous borders of the world: Turkish icons to Germany.
Cambodian temple reliefs to Thailand. Malian terra cotta figurines
to New York. Native American artifacts to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For a host of reasons _ fear of theft, fear of taxes, fear of
publicity _ even legitimate transactions in the world of ancient
art are often very private affairs. Because the traffic in illicit
antiquities is even more secretive, determining its scope is like
the proverbial blind man trying to guess the shape of an elephant
by touching only one part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which has been waging an aggressive war against the
illegal antiquities trade, has seized 122,000 pieces of art and
artifacts in the past five years, but authorities don't know how
many got away. Mexico last year recovered 10,000 artifacts stolen
from its archaeological sites, but acknowledges that the seizures
are a fraction of the total. In America, the National Park Service,
the lead agency for archaeological protection, spends more than $3
million a year on enforcement, but manages to arrest someone in
only about 10 percent of the 800 looting incidents each year on
federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, the international police agency, says the global
market in looted and stolen antiquities ranges from $4 billion to
$5 billion a year. That puts the smuggling of antiquities on a par
with illegal arms, and second only to international traffic in
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its clandestine deals, code of silence, smuggling
networks, laundered titles and phony export licenses, the
antiquities trade has more in common with drug trafficking and
organized crime than with most legitimate enterprises,'' says
Ricardo Elia, a Boston University archaeologist who studies the
trade of illicit artifacts. ``The difference _ and the problem for
law enforcement _ is that drugs are illegal all the time. Artifacts
may be illegal when they are dug up and smuggled out of a country,
but by the time they get laundered through third countries like
Switzerland and wind up here, they may wind up legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much activity is hidden from view, specifics emerge
only as snapshots: a chance airport seizure, an isolated arrest, a
looter caught in the act. In the case of the phiale, however, court
records submitted by U.S. and Italian investigators have traced the
travels of the golden bowl all the way from a suspected Sicilian
smuggling ring to the place of honor it occupied atop Steinhardt's
grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, neither
Steinhardt nor his attorney will comment on the case. Although U.S.
authorities have filed no criminal charges against Steinhardt, he
stands to lose the bowl and the $1.2 million he paid for it. The
unauthorized export of Italian antiquities is illegal, and the
courts found that the Customs declaration filed when the bowl was
brought into the United States was falsified.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has taken action of its own. Italian police have arrested
two men who played key roles in the case. They say Giacomo
Manganaro, a professor of ancient history in Sicily, and Vincenzo
Cammarata, a Sicilian coin dealer, were part of a major looting and
smuggling ring with ties to the Mafia. A raid by Italy's art theft
squad netted six alleged conspirators and 30,000 Phoenician, Greek
and Roman artifacts, valued at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Italian investigators say Manganaro, who was asked to
authenticate the bowl in 1980, was told that it had been dug up
near Caltavuturo, Sicily, by an electric utility crew. An
inscription along the edge of the bowl elaborately decorated with
concentric rings of acorns, beechnuts and honeybees is written in a
dialect of Doric Greek spoken in the colonies of ancient Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   But like most looted antiquities, the origins of the phiale _
and clues about the people who used it _ will probably always be a
mystery. And that, archaeologists say, is a loss that transcends
whatever monetary value the market assigns to it. The cumulative
loss to history, however, must be multiplied by the thousands of
illicit artifacts entering the market each year.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that Cammarata acquired the phiale from the
local antique dealer, paying for it with $20,000 worth of artworks.
Eventually, he showed a photo of it to Swiss art dealer William
Veres. Veres brought the bowl to the attention of Robert Haber, an
American art dealer. And Haber told Steinhardt it was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, with Haber as intermediary, offered $1.2 million for
the bowl, plus Haber's $162,000 commission. A one-page ``terms of
the sale'' specified that Manganaro, the Sicilian professor, would
provide a letter stating that he had seen the phiale 15 years
earlier in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the payment was wired to Veres' bank account
on Dec. 6, 1991. From that point, things moved swiftly. Four days
later, Haber flew from New York to Zurich, and then drove across
the Alps to Lugano, Switzerland, near the Italian border. On Dec.
12, he took possession of the bowl from Veres, who by then had paid
the Sicilians $90,000 for it.
</P>
<P>
   With the phiale in his luggage, Haber retraced his route _
Lugano to Zurich to New York. On arrival at Kennedy International
Airport on Dec. 13, the phiale was declared as ``one gold bowl ...
value $250,000.'' Because the country of origin was listed as
Switzerland, which does not bar the export of antiquities, he
wasn't challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, who got the Metropolitan Museum of Art to
authenticate the bowl, insists that he knew only that the seller
was ``a Sicilian coin dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinhardt was eager to know as little as possible about the
source of the phiale,'' says Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Barr, who
prosecuted the case. ``Steinhardt's lack of interest in the
particulars of the transaction is all the more disturbing in light
of his sophistication in dealing with the art market, having
purchased millions of dollars worth of antiquities, paintings and
other works of art from Haber and other dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Italian government learned about the phiale in the
1990s, apparently from Sicilian sources, it was displayed
prominently in Steinhardt's apartment. Then, in 1995, U.S. Customs
agents seized it and took it to the New York Customs vault, where
it has been ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its compelling chronology, the Steinhardt case
underscores several key aspects of the global antiquities market:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Illicitly obtained antiquities are seldom detected entering
the United States. ``We only examine 10 percent of the passengers
and cargo coming into New York,'' says U.S. Customs Special Agent
in Charge John Varrone. ``Most of the material we seize is
recovered only after it's in this country, often when someone
reports seeing something in a catalog or a display room.'' Even
though two-thirds of the art imported into the United States comes
through New York, customs officials there usually report only two
or three such seizures a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Switzerland is to the antiquities trade what the Cayman
Islands are to drug money. ``It's well-known that Switzerland is a
hub for both the legal and illegal activity in the antiquities
market,'' says Andrea Rascher, deputy director of the Swiss Office
for Culture, the agency that promotes and protects cultural
heritage. ``It's like money laundering. Because we have no import
or export restrictions, cultural goods are frequently brought to
Switzerland and allowed to cool down for a few years in Geneva or
Zurich. Storage in duty-free ports makes it easy to prevent their
discovery. Then it's off to New York, London or Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When it comes to black market antiquities, rewards seldom
accrue to the finder. Although Steinhardt paid $1.2 million for the
phiale, the money trail began when it sold in Italy for a mere
$20,000. ``The simple truth of the illicit trade in antiquities is
that there are large sums of money to be made, more than by
legitimate trading, and that very little of the proceeds ever
reaches the original funders,'' says Neil Brodie of the University
of Cambridge's Illicit Antiquities Research Centre in England,
which monitors the antiquities market.
</P>
<P>
   As highly charged as the Steinhardt case has been, the storm of
controversy over its implications for the global trade in
antiquities is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   New York art dealers and the American Association of Museums,
which entered the case on Steinhardt's side, view Italy's actions
as a threat not only to the art market, but to the holdings of many
major museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no interest in helping Mr. Steinhardt,'' says Edward
Able, association president. ``We abhor the looting and the illegal
export of cultural material, but we didn't want to see a precedent
set that could permit the looting of material now held in American
museums.'' Able says Italy never proved that the phiale was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Although reputable collectors shun stolen art, the Steinhardt
ruling tends to support the premise that, in countries where buried
artifacts are considered the nation's cultural property, anything
dug up illegally can be considered stolen, too. Since 1939, the
unauthorized export of Italian antiquities has been illegal.
Greece, Turkey, Egypt and dozens of other countries have similar
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Because U.S. common law holds that no buyer can acquire valid
title to stolen property, the Steinhardt case has shaken up the art
world. Applied across the board, it could put many private
collections at risk. Italy is considering legal action to recover a
collection of Sicilian silver held by the Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high cost of suing _ and the difficulty in proving
that, say, a Greek bowl such as the phiale really did come from
Italy _ source countries aren't likely to become wholesale raiders
of the lost arts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Archaeological Institute of America, the nation's
leading organization of professional archaeologists, which entered
the Steinhardt case on the side of the U.S. and Italian
governments, says the decision could help deter the epidemic of
looting _ spurred by market demand _ that is destroying many
archaeological sites before they can be studied.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the dispute doesn't leave much room for middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A price-driven international market
</P>
<P>
   Like the phiale, most of the ancient art in the world today was
once someone's booty. Looting was decried in an ancient Egyptian
papyrus in 134 B.C. The Romans sacked Greece. The Spanish pillaged
Mexico. The British plundered Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Only in this century, however, have legions of collectors
created a price-driven international market for such goods. And
only recently have looted countries become concerned about the way
in which their own cultures have been scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times when some of the world's important works of art were
threatened, collectors have saved them so they could be appreciated
by future generations,'' says Fred Schultz, owner of a prominent
New York gallery and president of the National Association of
Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art. ``All we are doing
is rescuing the bits of a country's culture that fall by the
wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that looters are destroying the history of
some countries, but collectors are not responsible for the looting.
It is looters who are responsible. Countries that don't enforce
their own laws are responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But antiquities are also subject to the law of supply and
demand. And because, in a world of 6 billion people, no one is
making new antiquities, increased demand inevitably creates a need
for more material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auction houses are doing more business every year,'' says
DePaul University law professor Patty Gerstenblith, editor of the
International Journal of Cultural Property, which reviews cultural
law and policy issues. ``If you accept that the number of existing
collections is limited, you have to accept that much of what is
being bought and sold on the market is new _ and therefore
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Art dealers and archaeologists may differ about the cause of the
problem, but the consequences are readily visible in the moonscapes
of looters' pits, ransacked tombs and defaced monuments in scores
of countries. The United States, where entire Indian pueblos have
been bulldozed to ``harvest'' artifacts, is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation we face today is not unlike the effort to keep
whales, elephants and the rhino from extinction,'' says Manus
Brinkman, secretary-general of the International Council of Museums
in Paris, which is working to curb the trade in illicit
antiquities. ``History is being erased before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many connoisseurs of antiquities would be appalled to think that
their love for ancient art might be destroying evidence of the
cultures that created it. In a number of cases, however,
uncontrolled looting has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists wish, for instance, that they knew more about the
Olmec, the mother culture of Central America, which built
sophisticated urban centers across western Mexico between 1500 B.C.
and 400 B.C. Olmec culture was first widely recognized in the
1940s. Political problems in Mexico delayed scientific study, but
not the looting. Olmec stone monuments and breathtaking jade masks,
some selling for $100,000 or more, quickly became popular items in
the art centers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time archaeologists got around to studying the Olmec,
many sites had been looted or destroyed,'' says University of
Alabama anthropologist Richard Diehl, an authority on Olmec art.
``These people left no written history, so most of our knowledge of
the culture is now based on objects that are scattered throughout
the world without any record of where they came from or how they
were found.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate befell the Bronze Age settlements of the Aegean
Sea. In the 1960s, the popularity of the abstractionist marble
statues produced by the Cycladic culture triggered a wave of
looting in the Aegean Islands. Today, archaeologists estimate that
as many as 12,000 Cycladic graves _ 85 percent of those known _
were destroyed in the frenzied looting. In the vacuum of knowledge,
fakes abound.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    BUYING, SELLING, STEALING HISTORY
 &HT;    A world of trouble: Where looting is rampant
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTARCTICA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Tools, supplies and artifacts left by the
continent's first explorers in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The threat: ``Souveniring'' past and present; a budding market
for artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The theft of artifacts is prohibited by treaty, with
some items being returned.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest, driest, most remote continent. In Antarctica,
human history is barely a century old. Yet for half that time,
looters and souvenir hunters have been chipping away its meager
cultural heritage _ pilfering what was left by explorers who
departed the frozen continent or died there.
</P>
<P>
   This year, British and New Zealand authorities rescued three
items _ a lantern, a dog harness and a coat hook _ about to be
auctioned at Christie's in London. Taken more than 40 years ago,
they were returned to the weather-beaten wooden hut at Cape Evans
once occupied by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, hundreds, perhaps thousands of items have been
taken from these sites,'' says David Crerer, chairman of New
Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust. ``We estimate that as many as
50 percent of the artifacts left by the early explorers are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the shores of the Ross Sea, dozens of old huts and supply
depots stand in mute testimony to the dawn of Antarctic exploration
in the early 1900s. Thanks to the cold, dry climate, many look as
if the owners had just stepped away. At Cape Evans, the carcasses
of sled dogs lie frozen. At Cape Royds, tins of biscuits and other
ship's stores still line the shelves once used by Ernest
Shakleton's crew.
</P>
<P>
   As sites in Antarctica have been stripped, New Zealand, whose
territory includes dozens of historic sites, has grown more
protective. These days, the huts are locked _ and the growing
number of tour groups are allowed in the huts only under
supervision. Only last year did the Antarctic Treaty Organization,
which includes the U.S., make removal of such items illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, ``souveniring'' was widely tolerated. The items
about to be sold were collected this year before such activity
became illegal. ``The items weren't so important by themselves,''
says Crerar. ``But we did not want to see a market established for
such items.'' If monetary values ever get assigned to Scott era
items, the danger to these sites would be greatly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Crerar's hopes suffered a setback on Friday, when Christie's
auctioned off $800,000 worth of Antarctic memorabilia. A few items,
including the flag Scott flew at the pole, were purchased in
advance by a Britsh museum, but most of the items, owned by
descendents of the explorers, were sold to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: More than 1,000 sites (Stone Age to Ming Dynasty,
A.D. 1600) on Yangzi River.
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Looting spurred by reservoir construction for the
Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: It's too late for many sites; archaeologists are trying
to make the best of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   China's Three Gorges Dam _ the largest hydroelectric project
ever attempted _ will allow ocean-going ships to travel 1,500 miles
inland. It will also displace more than 1.5 million people and
destroy 400 towns and villages, as well as obliterate 3,000 years
of Chinese history in 1,000 archaeological sites along the river
and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   The central government has promised professional excavations to
save the region's most impressive sites, like the caves of Dazu,
which hold a half-million stone sculptures from the 400-year span
of time from the Tang to the Ming dynasties. But archaeologists say
culturally important sites are still being lost _ such as those of
the Stone Age Ba people, who occupied the area before it was part
of China.
</P>
<P>
   China has declined help from archaeologists outside the country.
In desperation, some Chinese archaeologists are borrowing money to
finance their own digs.
</P>
<P>
   China's looters aren't waiting. Grave robbers, black marketers
and smugglers _ some equipped with cellular phones and two-way
radios _ have descended on the region. Not all of the looting is so
organized. At Fengjie, a county town on the Yangzi, dynamiting and
bulldozing by construction crews exposed more than 1,000 tombs,
touching off a frenzy of looting.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists say poverty provides a powerful incentive for
looters, but the demand for Chinese antiquities is also a major
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art and artifact smuggling out of China is a major basis for
western collections,'' says Zou Heng, professor of archaeology at
Peking University. ``In some places, hundreds of looters work day
and night. Dealers set up shop in nearby villages to buy artifacts,
which were then smuggled into Hong Kong, and then into the
international market _ dispersed to Japan, Thailand and throughout
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What has passed through New York, London and Berlin in the
last few years would fill a great museum,'' says Jerome Eisenberg,
owner of the Royal Athena Galley in New York. ``I went to China in
1994 to produce guides to the country's major archaeological sites.
Now I'm seeing the same material showing up on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular artifact to come out of China in recent
years was a 4-foot bronze ``spirit tree'' candelabra from the Han
Dynasty _ sold for $2.5 million last year at the International
Asian Art Fair in New York. Archaeologists say it may be the same
piece reportedly unearthed in the Three Gorges region the year
before and quickly sold on the black market for about $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Written records of classic Mayan civilization (A.D.
250 -1500).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Looters have stripped stone monuments from more than
300 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: As large carvings are depleted, looters are taking
smaller artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the world's leading Mayanists, Ian Graham has seen the
most remote corners of the Central American jungle. But in his
40-year quest to document the Mayan equivalent of hieroglyphics,
the 77-year-old archaeologist has made a discouraging number of his
discoveries in museums and private collections in Fort Worth, San
Diego, Cleveland, New York, Budapest and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working in Guatemala in the '60s, almost
everything was intact. Now, virtually all of the sculpture is
gone,'' says Graham, director of the Maya Corpus Program at Harvard
University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being able to study these inscriptions intact, they
have been cut into pieces and sold to people who only think of them
as trophies or tax deductions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Victories are few, but sweet. In August, Graham learned that a
collector was planning to sell part of a Mayan stone carving.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the masked human figure as a piece stolen from
northern Guatemala in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Customs agents and attorneys for the Guatemalan
government came calling, the collector agreed to surrender the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Even armed guards and double-locked gates at archaeological
sites have failed to deter the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looting and smuggling of artifacts is a major industry,'' says
Richard Hansen, a California archaeologist who has worked
extensively in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Peten, hundreds of sites have been totally overrun. It's
like trying to ward off hordes of ants.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanses says soaring prices for Mayan pottery is fueling the
frenzy. ``A single polychrome Codex pot can bring a Guatemalan
peasant $1,000,'' he says. ``Get it to Guatemala City and it takes
a dramatic jump. Smuggled to the United States or Japan, it can
fetch $100,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Stone reliefs, artifacts from world's oldest
civilizations (2000- 600 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: United Nations sanctions, post-war problems leave
remote desert sites open to looters.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Internal control is improving, but remote borders are
still open to smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is the
cradle of civilization, the home to ancient Sumeria, Assyria and
Babylonia. Since the Persian Gulf War and the imposition of
international sanctions, looters have been robbing the cradle _ and
its graves _ with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illicit digging for antiquities, especially in desert areas of
Iraq, has increased dramatically,'' says McGuire Gibson, a
University of Chicago archaeologist who specializes in the Middle
East. ``Gangs of up to 100 people work some sites, using
earthmoving equipment to open up the ruins. Large groups of stone
tablets and statues are being smuggled out along traditional
smuggling routes to Iran, through Kurdish northern Iraq, and from
there to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations sanctions have squeezed the country's economy to
the point that Iraq can't halt looting internally, and it gets
little help when stolen goods turn up elsewhere. A rare exception
was Jordan's seizure in July of more than 1,000 Iraqi artifacts _
cuneiform tablets, cylinder seals and a Sumerian stone statue more
than 4,000 years old _ being smuggled out on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Pillage is nothing new in the Iraqi countryside. Nor is the
Western world's interest in the cultures that thrived there from
the 4th millennium B.C. In 1994, one Assyrian wall panel sold at
auction for $11.8 million _ the highest price ever paid for any
antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's rich and varied heritage has been coveted by the
Western world since the 19th century heyday of imperial
acquisition,'' says John Malcolm Russell, archaeologist and art
historian at the Massachusetts College of Art. ``Back then,
European governments descended on the palaces of Mesopotamia and
sacked them to fill the halls of the British Museum, the Louvre and
the Berlin Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the mid-1990s, the problem has been the illicit art
market. At least 13 wall panels from the great Assyrian capital of
Nineveh and the palace at Nimrud have appeared for sale in London,
Brussels and other cities. So far no one has been arrested and none
of the panels have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Nations sanctions have finally finished the work begun
by the ancient Medes and Babylonians, who sacked Nineveh in 612
B.C,'' Russell says. ``A lot of people say the Iraqis got what's
coming to them. But this is not merely Iraq's problem. The people
of ancient Iraq influenced the way we speak and write and do
business today. This culture belongs to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA
</P>
<P>
   Endangered: Hundreds of temple sites built by the Khmer Empire
(A.D. 500-1400).
</P>
<P>
   The threat: Gangs of looters are stripping temples of stone
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Dismal. Cambodian government is unable to guard many
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lost, found and lost again in the jungles of Southeast Asia, the
ruins of Angkor Wat and other walled temples of the Khmer Empire
have endured centuries of neglect, conflict and the horrors of
Cambodia's killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Peace has not been so kind. Cambodia's ancient architecture is
being dismembered to feed a growing market for Khmer art and
artifacts. The crisis was highlighted this year when Thai police
intercepted a truck bound for Bangkok with 117 sandstone carvings _
estimated market value: $2 million _ which had been hacked off the
wall of a 12th century temple in northwest Cambodia. Investigators
say elements of the Cambodian army spent four weeks chiseling and
cutting the sculptures from the wall. So many were removed that a
40-foot section of the inner wall collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian police this year also found 40 tons of ancient statues
and carvings hidden near the jungle headquarters of former Khmer
Rouge leader Ta Mok. ``On a recent visit to Thailand, I had a
dealer show me pictures of sandstone panels _ still on the temple
walls _ that he said he could obtain for me,'' says John Stubbs,
vice president of the World Monuments Fund, which works to protect
Cambodian sites. ``He was, in effect, offering to loot them to
order.''
</P>
<P>
   In another big haul in July, Thai police seized eight tons of
Cambodian artifacts _ 29 cases of Hindu and Buddhist sculptures _
being smuggled in from Singapore. Later, they seized another 110
Cambodian artifacts on sale in a Bangkok shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian authorities have vowed to crack down. Looters have
been warned that they will be shot on sight. But with 400 police
guarding Angkor Wat, the country's most famous temple complex, the
country doesn't have the resources to protect its more than 1,000
temple sites.

ALLEN DENTIST SENDS HOPE _ AND HIMSELF _ TO HONDURAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I contact Dr. Tom Brian of Allen, Texas, a dentist
who coordinated relief for Honduras in the wake of Hurricane Mitch?
_ J.C., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him at 720 E. Main St., Suite A, Allen, TX 75002, or
call his office at (972) 727-5001. You can send e-mail to
atbdds\Nyahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brian is the founder of Send Hope, a nonprofit group that
provides food, health care, educational supplies and other
assistance to residents of the Mosquito Coast in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began with a visit in 1991, and Brian is returning in
October to provide free dental care and bring a 12-year-old to the
United States for orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continually collecting things like school supplies,
dried food, shoes, bicycles and household goods,'' said his wife,
Sharon Brian. ``Anything that is nonbreakable and nonelectric.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any book compilations of the comic strip ``They'll
Do It Every Time'' by Jimmy Hatlo? _ M.L., Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are at least two out-of-print books that include
Hatlo's work on the strip: the 1943 ``They'll Do It Every Time''
and a Pocket Book paperback with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The 1943 book reprinted 100 comic strips and was published by
David McKay Co. Barnes &AMP; Noble's out-of-print book search turned up
a copy at Second Chance Books in Monmouth, Ore. Call (503) 838-5279
for ordering information.
</P>
<P>
   Hatlo, a sports cartoonist for the ``Call-Bulletin'' in San
Francisco, created the comic strip in 1929. Al Scaduto took over
the King Features Syndicate strip when Hatlo died in 1963, and it
still appears in 100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hatlo books found by Barnes &AMP; Noble: ``Brand New
Cartoons,'' ``New Jimmy Hatlo Book,'' ``Newest Jimmy Hatlo Cartoon
Book'' and ``Another New Jimmy Hatlo Book.'' You can search the
out-of-print database on the World Wide Web at www.bn.com.

   Q: Are there any book compilations of the comic strip ``They'll
Do It Every Time'' by Jimmy Hatlo? _ M.L., Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are at least two out-of-print books that include
Hatlo's work on the strip: the 1943 ``They'll Do It Every Time''
and a Pocket Book paperback with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The 1943 book reprinted 100 comic strips and was published by
David McKay Co. Barnes &AMP; Noble's out-of-print book search turned up
a copy at Second Chance Books in Monmouth, Ore. Call (503) 838-5279
for ordering information.
</P>
<P>
   Hatlo, a sports cartoonist for the ``Call-Bulletin'' in San
Francisco, created the comic strip in 1929. Al Scaduto took over
the King Features Syndicate strip when Hatlo died in 1963, and it
still appears in 100 newspapers.

proportions than ever before and redefining the very meaning of the
centuries-old caste system. The rising political clout and

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ One morning soon after the start of the school
year in Teri Putnam's sixth-grade math class at the Julia Morgan
School for Girls here, each student took a turn at the white board,
explaining how she had arrived at the answer to a tricky problem.
Ms. Putnam invited others to chime in, and nearly all of them did.
No one stopped to raise her hand, and the discussion became a
lively yet well-mannered free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the classroom, a dozen or so rather antiquated computers
arrived _ a donation from a well-wisher. The school is already well
equipped with iMac's, but Katie Topper, the technology director,
welcomed the gift. Some of the machines would be used by girls who
needed one at home. Others would be taken apart by students to see
how a computer works.
</P>
<P>
   The Julia Morgan School, which opened its doors for the first
time earlier this month, is one of two independent girls' schools
to have started recently in the San Francisco Bay Area. The other,
30 miles to the south in Mountain View, in the heart of Silicon
Valley, is the year-old Girls' Middle School. Both schools have
engineering, science, computers and math squarely at the center of
their curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Such schools, opening at a time when applications to girls'
schools are on the rise, aspire not only to get girls through
adolescence with their self-esteem intact but also to turn a
stereotype on its head _ the notion that women do not belong in
technical fields.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other well-established girls' schools across
the nation are beefing up their science, math and technology
curriculums and adding new science buildings and summer programs.
The Dana Hall School, a girls' middle and high school in Wellesley,
Mass., for instance, has opened an $8 million science building. The
rooms are geared to a collaborative learning approach, which
researchers say is an optimal way for girls to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Porter's School, a girls' high school in Farmington, Conn.,
that requires each student to take two programming courses, opened
a similar state-of-the-art math, science and technology building
two years ago. Miss Porter's also has a summer program in math,
science and technology for middle school girls.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus on science and technology at girls' schools comes
at a time when high school girls are catching up to boys in math
and science achievement. But there remains a serious gap between
the sexes in technology. In 1998, girls made up only 17 percent of
the high school students who took the advanced placement exam in
computer science.
</P>
<P>
   The gap persists through higher education and into the
workplace. Women earn 18 percent of the doctorates in computer
science in the United States, and only 12 percent of all
engineering Ph.D.'s. Women make up nearly half the nation's work
force, yet they account for just 22 percent of employed scientists
and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say adolescence is where the problem begins. In starting
the Girls' Middle School, Kathleen Bennett, a 54-year-old former
teacher and Silicon Valley technical writer, wrote a business plan
that drew heavily on well-established research showing that by the
time girls reach sixth grade, they are in danger of being swindled
out of more than just their self-esteem. As puberty takes hold,
girls begin to lose the self-confidence that once helped them excel
in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of them love math and science,'' Ms. Bennett said, ``but
something happens to them where they start to pull away.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers collude in this process, education experts say, by
failing to call on girls in class as frequently as they call on
boys and by discouraging girls in other subtle ways. Ann Clarke,
the Julia Morgan School's director and a veteran educator, said she
had seen firsthand the tentativeness with which adolescent girls
approached math when she had begun looking over the math tests she
had given prospective students. ``Across the top of six of the
exams, right next to their names, the girls had written, `I'm not
good at math,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been boys in Ms. Putnam's math class, Ms. Clarke said,
the class would have been more frenetic. ``Sometimes the boys are
quicker to want to get to the answer,'' she said. ``There's a
different energy around girls. Boys do things more in spurts.''
</P>
<P>
   At both Julia Morgan and the Girls' Middle School, the
curriculum is carefully balanced with other subjects. Ms. Putnam,
the math teacher at Julia Morgan, doubles as the flag football
instructor. Ms. Topper also teaches Spanish and soccer. Ms. Clarke
teaches drama. And an entire room is devoted to morning yoga
exercises. Each fall, seventh graders at the Girls' Middle School
go off on a weeklong camping trip to learn to work together and to
build self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no mistaking the emphasis placed on engineering
and science at the Girls' Middle School. The school's math and
science classroom is lined with science posters, offering
at-a-glance lessons in surface area, the periodic table and
Fibonacci numbers (a series in which each number is the sum of the
previous two numbers). Each of the 10 computer carrels in the
computer laboratory is named for a famous woman. One is Ada
Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, who worked with Charles Babbage,
the 19th-century computer pioneer, writing what would have been the
programming for the first computer if Babbage had been able to
build it.
</P>
<P>
   Before math class at the Girls' Middle School one day earlier
this month, a few of the new sixth graders, all 11 years old,
talked to a reporter about what it was like to be at a school where
boys have as much impact by their absence as by their presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys at my old school were obnoxious, and we never had time to
learn,'' said Katie O'Sullivan, whose professional goal is to
organize a National Women's Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle Bressack, who wants to be a computer scientist when
she grows up, said, ``We don't have to worry about being made fun
of here.''

</P>
<P>
   In a single-sex environment, Ms. Bennett and other proponents of
single-sex education say, girls receive encouragement for what they
do rather than for how they look. ``That's life-changing, and it's
also revolutionary,'' said Arlene Hogan, head administrator at the
Archer School, a six-year-old school for girls in Pacific
Palisades, Calif. ``I'd go to the mat on the fact that girls in
middle schools in a coed environment are mainly interested in what
the boys think and in not embarrassing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents seem to agree. Since 1991, after two decades of decline,
the average number of applications to girls' schools each year has
risen by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And according to a study of 1,200 seniors in girls' school in
1990 conducted by the National Coalition of Girls' Schools, 25
percent of the girls surveyed said they intended to pursue math,
science and technology in college, four times the national average.
In a study of 4,000 graduates of 63 girls' schools, 62 percent said
they had gone into their college math and science courses with
better preparation than had women from coed high schools. The
survey was done last spring by the Goodman Research Group and was
sponsored by the girls' schools coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's an oyster for these girls,'' said Meg Moulton,
executive director of the coalition. ``The sooner you expose them
to the possibility of science and technology, it can't help but
spark and encourage the possibility of sustained interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not clear that single-sex education is itself the
solution to the so-called gender gap problem. In 1998, the American
Association of University Women released a much-debated report that
found no overall evidence that single-sex education was better for
girls than coeducation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the school and the student and the context,''
said Pamela Haag, a senior research associate at the university
women's group. ``Our interpretation is that good education is
grounded in basic principles. And once in place, girls can succeed
in a coed environment as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some education experts say that the key to making girls
interested in math, science and technology lies not so much in
single-sex schools as in better teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   Working under a grant from the National Science Foundation,
Marcia Linn, a professor of math, science and technology education
at the University of California at Berkeley, found that making
science personally relevant to students contributed to sex equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both girls and boys complain about the irrelevance of science
and math in their lives,'' she said. ``The idea is to make it so
that it comes up again and again in your life.'' For example, Dr.
Linn said, ``have students use energy-efficient materials to design
a house, using the ideas of heat and temperature in situations that
matter to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any highly convincing research to demonstrate that
for every student or randomly selected group of students, assigning
them to a single-sex setting will necessarily be beneficial,'' Dr.
Linn continued. ``I'm much more in favor of making the way we teach
in our middle schools effective for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linn has been asked to advise both the Julia Morgan School
and the Girls' Middle School on how to shape their technology
curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Some successes are undeniable. For several years, Castilleja, a
girls' middle and high school in Palo Alto, Calif., established in
1907, has sent teams to compete in the robotics competition at the
nearby Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Last year,
Castilleja, which had the only girls in the competition, took both
first and third place. ``It's one thing to be good on campus; it's
quite another to compete among the best,'' said Joan Lonergan, the
head of the school. ``That reinforces the message, `We can do
anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   More low-key successes are frequent for students at the Girls'
Middle School. At an ``engineering night'' for parents in the last
school year, a parade of sixth graders showed off the bridges they
had constructed, explaining the rudiments of engineering along the
way: load paths, tension and compression, and rotational
equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't just explaining science _ they were having a
blast doing it,'' said Dan Lynch, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who
is one of the school's two principal donors. Lynch said he intended
to send his daughter, Katherine, who is in fifth grade, to the
Girls' Middle School next year. ``The whole thing showed me how
much these students are in charge of themselves.''

   UNDATED: knowledge, fakes abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more Cycladic figures in New York today
than anywhere else in the world,'' says Christopher Chippindale, a
curator of the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology. ``But so few were ever recovered in an archaeological
context, it's virtually impossible to know which are genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most high-end items are sold privately, the market for
ancient art can only be estimated. But if public sales at major
auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's are any measure, the
demand is robust. The most recent antiquities auctions, in June,
drew standing-room-only crowds at both firms. In two days, they
sold $10 million worth of ancient art, topped by the sale of a
4.5-inch-high Elamite figure _ a 3,000-year-old stone carving from
Iran that sold at Sotheby's for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the diminutive figurine had been on loan to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1985, its recent history was a
matter of record. But detailed pedigrees are the exception. Many
items in auction catalogs carry only vague references to ownership
_ ``property of an American private collection'' _ or sometimes
nothing at all. The anonymity of seller as well as buyer is
something all auction houses honor as a sacred trust.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the information is missing because the seller doesn't
know. Sometimes, like Steinhardt, neither the auction house nor its
customers want to know too much. Reputable dealers routinely check
law enforcement agencies and electronic databases of stolen art to
help them avoid ``hot'' material. But looted items are not so
easily identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic policy is that we won't sell anything that we know
has been illegally excavated,'' says Rena Moulopoulos, the attorney
who heads Sotheby's compliance division, which is charged with
ensuring the legitimacy of objects it offers for sale. ``If a
seller warrants that an object is legally and ethically acquired,
then we treat it as legitimate and we can sell it. This is not a
science and we are not detectives. We try to avoid anything that
has been recently looted, but we're not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the presumption of legitimacy, in the absence of
proof to the contrary, merely encourages the sale of illicitly
obtained antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My surveys of auction houses and independent collections show
that about 80 percent of the items turn up without explanations of
where they came from or how they got there,'' says Chippindale.
``The usual story is that they came from an old European
collection, but there just aren't that many old collections.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethics, treaties used to fight illicit trade
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, the FBI, Scotland Yard and other institutions all keep
detailed records of stolen objects. The largest database,
maintained by the London-based Art Loss Register, lists more than
100,000 stolen items. Since 1991, the organization, funded largely
by the insurance industry, has helped recover $75 million worth of
stolen art.
</P>
<P>
   Looted objects are another matter. No private owner has been
wronged. No insurance company wants restitution. Most looted
material is never reported missing, so there is no central listing
or guidance, only the ethics of the buyer _ and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stopped dealing in pre-Columbian material,'' says
Jerome Eisenberg, owner of the Royal-Athena Galleries on East 57th
Street in New York. ``Ninety percent of the material that has been
brought out of South and Central America in recent years is
illegal. It's a shame. For anyone with a sense of ethics, it is
hard to deal in pre-Columbian.''
</P>
<P>
   But no country's artifacts are above suspicion. Last year,
Eisenberg returned a $30,000 Greek amphora after the original owner
notified him it had been stolen from a French villa in 1981.
Eisenberg was miffed. He had purchased the vase at a Christie's of
London auction just months before. And it had been sold before at
Sotheby's in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate records of previous owners and an object's movement
across borders could help distinguish legal pieces, but dealers say
a system of passports for antiquities would be futile. The
falsified papers for the phiale are a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly obvious that everything on the market isn't
coming from old collections,'' says Schultz. ``But having a piece
of paper saying something is from an existing collection isn't the
answer. People make up collection histories. There are a lot of
clever ways of doing it. It's easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal efforts to curb illicit traffic depend on a patchwork of
international treaties and mismatched national laws that often pit
antiquity-rich countries of the world against art-hungry consumers
in the United States, Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The key treaty, the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization's convention on cultural property, has
been signed by 89 countries, but it can't be invoked in many
countries that are destinations for looted antiquities. Key nations
at the crossroads of the antiquities trade _ including the United
Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands _ haven't signed
it. The United States ratified the treaty in 1983 only after a
bitter congressional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law implementing the treaty in the United States was so
weakened by opposition from art dealers and museums that individual
agreements between the United States and each country seeking
protection have been necessary to make it work,'' says David
Walden, chairman of UNESCO's Committee for the Return of Cultural
Property.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the United States has concluded pacts for the return
of illegally exported artifacts with just seven countries. Two of
those agreements _ with Canada and Peru _ are under challenge by
the nation's art dealers. In all, there have been fewer than a
dozen U.S. seizures of stolen or looted property.
</P>
<P>
   A second treaty designed to aid in the recovery of looted or
stolen antiquities primarily in Europe, where property laws differ,
has been ratified by only one-third of the 22 nations that signed
it in 1996. The United States is not a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient with the pace of international efforts, some countries
have been taking matters into their own hands _ seeking their own
remedies in the U.S. courts, as Italy did with the golden phiale.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, billionaire William Koch ended a decade-long legal
battle with the government of Turkey over ownership of the Elmali
Hoard _ a $2 million collection of ancient silver coins that he
acquired in the late 1980s. Koch, an avid coin collector as well as
the skipper of the winning yacht in the 1992 America's Cup, had
acquired the 2,400-year-old coins at auction. Investigators showed
that they had been unearthed by Turkish villagers in the mid-1980s
and smuggled to the United States by way of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the civil trial, Koch surrendered the coins in
exchange for a medal from the Turkish government thanking him for
``safeguarding'' the coins for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey will continue its vigorous efforts around the world,
not only to recover the rest of the Elmali Hoard, but other stolen
antiquities,'' says Larry Kaye, a New York attorney who represents
Turkish interests in cases involving disputed antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye says the message should be clear to anyone buying ancient
art. Like the game of hot potato, the last person caught holding
illegally obtained goods _ whether they were stolen or looted _ may
get burned.

 &HT;    GRIEVING TAIWANESE STRUGGLE TOWARD QUAKE'S EPICENTER TO AID
RELATIVES, RESCUERS FIND MORE BODIES
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   PULI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese by the thousands threaded across
half-ruptured bridges here Wednesday, past fresh rockslides and
across miles of rippled asphalt to search for relatives at the
epicenter of the Taiwan earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With rescue efforts complicated by Wednesday's aftershocks, they
found that nature had dealt capriciously with this mountain town of
89,000 people closest to the quake's ground zero. Here and
elsewhere in Taiwan's hardest-hit Nantou County it looked as if the
quake had hopscotched across the landscape like a giant tornado,
devastating one place while leaving adjacent territory seemingly
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what seemed just as remarkable was that anyone could have
survived the epicenter's fury Tuesday, and then three jolting
aftershocks measuring 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0 _ the strongest of more than
2,000 that have rocked the island _ on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks were feared to have triggered mudslides, cracked
one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs and forced evacuations, as the
death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,008 people, with 4,400
injured, officials said. Some 2,600 people were believed to be
trapped in rubble and 208 still missing, but rescuers were finding
more bodies than survivors as they bored into collapsed houses and
high-rise apartment complexes across central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, relatives and rescue workers here in
Puli had pulled out 180 dead bodies from the wreckage of more than
1,000 squashed buildings. Another 1,020 people have turned up
injured, and the scent of decaying bodies indicates that at least
some others remain in the wreckage of buildings that seemed to have
collapsed to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the people remaining under the rubble are all
dead,'' Mayor Hung Ming Chang told reporters about 40 hours after
Monday's quake that measured 7.6 on the open-ended Richter scale.
The mayor estimated that one-fourth of his town had been totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on this island of 22 million, rescue efforts yielded
just nine people pulled alive from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Much-needed rescue crews from Fairfax Co., Va., and Miami-Dade,
Fla., arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and rescued a man who had been
trapped 48 hours inside a caved-in apartment building in the town
of Touliu.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my building?'' 33-year-old survivor Hsu
Tse-kai asked repeatedly, according to the Associated Press, as the
crews spent eight hours digging him out of a four-story chunk of
building that had been compressed into about 10 feet of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue workers then started digging deeper in search of a
1-year-old boy, saying they were encouraged by listening devices
that appeared to pick up the sound of a child's toy, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 countries have sent earthquake specialists to the
island, including the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey,
Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Central News Agency placed the number of foreign specialists
in the country at about 500, with more scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Puli, at least, the fast-moving relief effort seemed
markedly more effective than the near-paralysis that beset Turkish
agencies when a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck central Turkey in
August, killing more than 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And by whatever quirk of the way nature's tectonic plates
collided in the belly of the earth, many of Puli's inhabitants
lived to tell about it. And although most buildings suffered cracks
in interior walls, most looked relatively undamaged from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Puli, desperate relatives had to drive their cars or
motorcycles across a dozen precarious bridges whose pavement had
sunk or collapsed. Some were passable only because workers laid
down patches that looked like steel band-aids across gaps in the
joints of bridge sections.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was a journey to grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is still buried there in the first floor,'' said Luo
Jian Zhe, a 33-year-old salesman, clutching an incense stick as he
watched Japanese and Taiwanese rescue crews drilling into his
prosperous in-laws' collapsed four-story home. Luo watched rescuers
haul out the corpses of
</P>
<P>
   four of his in-laws, only to learn that his sister, too, had
been found crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   For others like semiconductor engineer Child Lee(CQ), joy was at
the other end of the perilous ascent from western Taiwan's
relatively untouched coastal flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't know what was going on here because we couldn't
connect by telephone,'' said Lee, 33, ``so we had to come up here
somehow to see.'' Lee found that his sister's father-in-law, a
retired bank executive, had survived unhurt and with most of his
possessions intact within a few miles of the epicenter of one of
Taiwan's deadliest quakes since a 7.4 magnitude tremor hit the
island in 1935, killing 3,276 people. Taiwan is hit by dozens of
quakes each year, but most are centered in the Pacific Ocean east
of the island and cause no damage.
</P>
<P>
   The ravaging of this Puli alone, accounted for nearly one-tenth
of the deaths due to the earthquake throughout Taiwan, and
one-fourth of the island's earthquake injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With Puli emerging on Taiwanese television reports as the center
of devastation, the high command of the Taiwanese Army flew and
trucked in hundreds of soldiers to mount a formidable
military-style relief effort for Puli and surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat this calamity like a war,'' said Maj. Gen. Wu Se Hui,
one of a procession of senior commanders who have been arriving
aboard helicopter relief flights to supervise local aid efforts.
``Once the order comes down from the top, we can move very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 24-hour period, the Taiwanese Army landed more than 60
helicopter loads of food, bottled water, tents, frozen blood and
other supplies in Puli's makeshift rescue center in an athletic
field behind an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   With the morgues and hospitals in Puli overflowing with scores
of corpses, the Army began flying in blocks of ice and body bags to
prevent the victims from decomposing before they could be examined
by forensic investigators and then buried.

TAIWAN QUAKE MAY BE SIMILAR TO NORTHRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The killer earthquake in Taiwan may have
involved a blind thrust fault, the same type of fault that
triggered the Northridge earthquake in Southern California nearly
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These buried faults, which cause vertical ground motion, lurk
within the crust, unseen and unpredictable. By contrast,
strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas, move horizontally and are
clearly revealed by their surface expressions, such as valleys and
long, narrow lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the United States hope to learn more about the
behavior of such faults by studying seismic data from Taiwan. On
that island, scientists have in recent years operated impressive
networks of quake-monitoring instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is especially quake-prone because it is where giant
geological plates collide into each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan is actually a fairly seismically active area,'' said
Tom Holzer, an engineering geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park. ``They're at the boundary between two of the large
(geological) plates that are moving very fast together _ the
Philippine and Eurasian plate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's crust is
fragmented into giant plates, hundreds or thousands of miles
across. Plates creep along, driven at least partly by the continual
upwelling of hot matter from the planet's interior, like the
up-and-down convection of noodles in a boiling pot of soup.
</P>
<P>
   Continents sit atop the moving plates; hence continental drift,
in which continents move hundreds or thousands of miles over
millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Near Taiwan, plate collisions compress the crust, forcing parts
of it upward, just as one can force the center of a piece of paper
upward by compressing its two sides together. The rising crust
forms mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Because of intense crustal compression caused by plate
collisions, ``Taiwan is one of the most active mountain-building
(regions) in the world,'' said Wu-Cheng Chi, a Taiwanese graduate
student studying seismology at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Mountains are building so rapidly on the island that if it
continued nonstop for a million years, Taiwan would rise more than
100 miles high, Chi said. That wouldn't happen in real life, he
added, partly because while the island is rising, erosion is
steadily conveying much of its surface back into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the Taiwan quake is on land, near the town of
Nantou in Ji-Ji County. Taiwanese geologists were scouting the
hillsides, looking for signs of ground ruptures caused by the
fault. But if it is a truly blind thrust fault, they won't find
any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard any reports of surface rupture being
observed'' on Taiwan, said Tom Yelin, a seismologist at another
USGS office in Seattle. ``The epicenter is in a very rugged area, a
very mountainous area that doesn't have a lot of roads in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when the Northridge quake struck in January 1994,
geologists struggled to identify any surface ruptures in the nearby
Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties about Monday's earthquake, quake
experts say it has no connection with the other recent disastrous
earthquakes in Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a coincidence,'' said UC-Berkeley quake authority
Barbara Romanowicz. The only reason these quakes were noticed is
because they hit populated regions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, she noted, about 10 similar-sized quakes
strike around the world. Almost all go unnoticed because of where
they hit: the middle of nowhere, such as a vast jungle, an isolated
steppe or the ocean bottom.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Simon needed a splashy design around the entrance
of his new amusement center in Times Square, he chose the image of
a Wurlitzer jukebox. He hoped the classic icon would set the tone
for a cleaner, friendlier video game experience inside.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after 1930s New York, Simon's center, Broadway City, is
a fun-house amalgamation of the city's most recognizable landmarks.
Electronic baseball games await players in a circular room designed
like Yankee Stadium. Vintage 1980s arcade-game hits like Galaga
chirp near a facade of the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents don't want to go into a dirty old arcade,'' Simon
said. ``I want to create an inviting atmosphere for the entire
family.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one. While Times Square is getting its
millennial make-over, a new generation of high-tech entertainment
centers are competing to reap the rewards. Broadway City and ESPN
Zone, which has a sports theme, joined the competition this month;
two others, XS New York and Lazer Park, have been in the area since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call them arcades. In an industry long associated
with violent video games and delinquent teen-agers, these hubs of
the coin-operated game business are embracing a new style to reach
a larger market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old-style mall arcades are giving way to the megaplex gaming
complex,'' said Kevin Hayes, president of Namco, the company behind
Pac-Man and other arcade hits, adding that today's businesses try
to steer clear of the ``a'' word. ``Arcades still conjure negative
associations for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The game industry's official term for these new establishments
is location-based entertainment. Rather than solely offering games,
like shopping mall arcades, these complexes offer a blend of games
and dining in more sophisticated environments.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg pioneered this new breed of amusement centers
with his lavish Game Works arena in Seattle in 1997. That high-tech
playpen, now one in an international chain of a dozen (though none
in New York), combines the latest state-of-the-art video and
virtual-reality simulation games in a sprawling, futuristic
setting.
</P>
<P>
   The games in these new arcades are a giant step up from
plywood-boxed console games with nicotine-stained controls and a
lock bar across the coin box. They tend to offer high-powered
simulations that, for example, let game players sit on a jet ski
while a towering screen animates their path through watery froth,
or lets them strap on snow skis to have a screen create the
illusion of flying downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the creators of Mickey Mouse have got into the
game as well with their own complex, Disney Quest. Opened near the
Disney World and Epcot theme parks in Orlando, Fla., Disney Quest
has games that let visitors design and ride their own virtual
roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Another Disney Quest is in the works for Chicago. Club Disney, a
toddler-oriented amusement chain, is open in Southern California,
Arizona and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Regional Entertainment, the division of the Walt Disney
Co. that developed Club Disney and Disney Quest, is also behind
ESPN Zone, a 42,000-square-foot dining and game complex in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   In the Zone, fans can watch a flesh-and-blood sports event like
a Giants game, then try their hand at computerized auto racing,
parachuting and basketball simulators. Other Zones have opened in
Baltimore and Chicago, and new locations are being developed in
Atlanta and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here to manipulate games with skill and
athleticism,'' said ESPN Zone's director of operations, Rob Perez.
``We're an active sports playground.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a playground with considerable rules. ESPN Zone is the most
decidedly crowd-controlled game center; children under 18 are not
admitted without adult supervision. And yes, the Zone asks for
identification. ``We're very in tune with security concerns,''
Perez said. ``We aren't a hangout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hangout,'' especially in Times Square, precisely describes the
century-old reputation that the industry is trying to shake. A
hundred years ago, hand-cranked peep shows lured a seedy crowd with
their sometimes pornographic content.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, pinball parlors were thought of as
hangouts for ruffians. The video game craze of the early '80s led
to sensationalized fears that teen-age mobs would roam the shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   It was around this time that the first family entertainment
centers aimed to blast the stigma. A franchise called Chuck E.
Cheese struck a winning formula by combining a parent-friendly
pizza parlor with a well-patrolled battery of cute video games like
Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.
</P>
<P>
   By the '90s, however, entrepreneurs in the coin-op world had a
more formidable concern than juvenile delinquents: a mature and
booming home video game business. Consoles like the Sony
Playstation and Nintendo 64 are striking gold, especially with
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Portable hardware like the Nintendo Gameboy made game players of
adolescents and business people alike. Games like Quake and Ultima
Online, a medieval role-playing epic, popularized the world of
multiplayer games, an online form of competition that enables
players around the world to go head to head by using their
computers and modems.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the computer game and video game industry is now bigger
than the film business, accounting for more than $6 billion each
year. The arcade business, in turn, has been on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey by Vending Times, a trade publication, there
were approximately 1 million games in arcades during 1988, but only
590,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is definitely not as strong as we'd like it to
be,'' said Robert Fay, executive director of the American Amusement
Machine Association, an Illinois-based organization that represents
120 leading arcade game manufacturers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to approximate the home video game
experience, coin-operated centers are now trying to give game
players reasons to leave their living rooms: snazzier games, tonier
surroundings and, for some, a place to socialize as well as play.
</P>
<P>
   Dave &AMP; Buster's, a Dallas-based franchise that attached a bar
and restaurant to a video game arcade, is a kind of upscale Chuck
E. Cheese for adults. Happy-hour game players can munch nachos and
shoot pool, then strap themselves into a dinosaur ride _ all under
one roof.
</P>
<P>
   XS New York, which opened with great fanfare in the heart of
Times Square two years ago, has also tried to rid itself of the
traditional arcade associations. Rick Brenner, chief executive of
XS New York, said his company had taken steps to insure a safe
environment that is free of loitering teen-agers. Bright white
lights have been placed in formerly dark corners. Loud rock and
hip-hop music has been discontinued for long periods at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to just hang around,'' Brenner said.
``But we don't want to be a police state, either. Still, if people
see what appear to be gangs and hooligans, then a family might not
walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough in Times Square, there will be a lot more
competition for those family dollars. The city's 42d Street
Development Project is currently transforming one of the world's
most notoriously sleazy streets into an entertainment strip that
will include a 25-screen movie multiplex and an HMV record store.
</P>
<P>
   Simon of Broadway City said he was confident that his
establishment would fit right in with the clean, modern spirit.
``We won't overwhelm people with games,'' he said. ``We want our
warmth to shine through.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some opera houses may be using sound systems to
enhance the voices of their singers, but not the Metropolitan
Opera. There the tenors still wear velvet capes, swear vengeance
and sing their arias without any help from electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But backstage, even the Met has accepted the microchip. The
hydraulic elevators, rigging and old-fashioned electromechanical
systems in use since the Met opened its doors at Lincoln Center in
1966 are gradually being joined by their digital counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   These days, computers control the mountain that moves
majestically across the stage in ``Moses und Aron,'' trick the eye
with a battery of subtly controlled lights as the ghost of a
countess rises through the floor in ``The Queen of Spades,'' move
Puck in breathtaking arcs far above the stage in ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   They drive the Met's system of seat-back translations and ease
the complexities of putting on a fully staged opera _ never the
same one two nights in a row _ on every night but Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The changes did not come easily for the opera company, which was
far slower than many European and American houses to introduce
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very cautious about introducing digital
technology,'' said Joseph Volpe, the general manager. ``In Europe,
where the opera is heavily subsidized by the government, if they
are having trouble with a production as a result of technology,
they can just delay an opening or do it in concert form. That's not
acceptable here. That's why we go slow with technology. We want it
to be as foolproof as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff workers at the opera house who handle the new
technology have backgrounds that combine musical training with an
aptitude for the digital. Nerves of steel seem to come in handy,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part musician and part geek,'' said Thomas H. Connell III,
the company's principal stage manager, who cues each action on
stage. Connell's art requires not only the ability to read a
musical score as fluently as most people would flip through a
magazine but also the ability to keep in communication, through a
headset, with several dozen people scattered backstage while
following a console packed with video monitors and telephones and,
of course, watching the conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the usual eclectic Met background,'' Connell said. ``I
sang in a choir and played the viola. But I was also a Navy pilot _
that was a lot less difficult and scary than putting on some
operas.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the musical and the technical underpinnings of Connell's
world change every night. ``There are different conductors,
different cuts, different singers,'' he explained, ``not to mention
20 to 30 pages of notes and prompt lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology helps reduce production complications by
making stage positions more predictable. ``We use automated control
for certain types of moving scenery to get repeatability and exact
positioning,'' said Dana Gracey, chief electrician at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the aerial spirit Puck in ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' who used to fly across the stage in a harness and rigging,
now sails 35 feet above the stage on programmable winches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can slow him down or ramp him up and know exactly where he
is,'' Gracey said. The controls permit precise acceleration or
deceleration and can be adjusted fairly quickly during rehearsal.
``It's complicated when you are setting it up, but then it makes
life a bit easier for repeatability in a house with a constantly
changing repertory,'' Gracey said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-driven winches control not only the airy Puck but also
the more elemental bulk of Mount Sinai, complete with a singing
Moses and a burning bush that moves serenely across the stage in
Schoenberg's ``Moses und Aron.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mountain doesn't quite match the music,'' Connell said,
``we can always override the computer and slow down the mountain
manually.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers come into play not only to move mountains but also to
handle the seat-back translations for operas sung in their original
language, which at the Met is much more likely to be Italian,
French, German, Czech or Russian than English.
</P>
<P>
   In most opera houses that permit translations, they are
projected over the proscenium arch or to the side. ``We wanted a
system that would be more personal and that wouldn't introduce a
visual conflict with the production on the stage,'' said Joseph
Clark, technical director at the Met. ``So we waited.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clark's direction, the opera house developed a personal
computer-driven system of titles that can be viewed on a tiny
screen attached to the seat in front of each viewer. The wording of
the translations matches the action on stage fairly closely,
enabling more operagoers to follow the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences that in the past were noticeably restive in the more
expository stretches of Wagner's ``Ring'' cycle have at last
quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the helm of the translation-system technology are
the callers, who give the go-ahead before each piece of text is
released from the computer and sent to the nearly 4,000 seat backs
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The callers make sure that each translation appears and departs
when it is supposed to _ no easy job with singers who slow down and
speed up in a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology has brought another benefit to the opera
house besides the translations: increased rehearsal time on stage,
a particularly precious commodity for a fully booked repertory
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In precomputer days, we built a mock-up of complicated scenery
and then tested it on stage to make sure it worked,'' Clark said.
``We had to use scarce time _ most on-stage time is used for
musical preparation and staging _ to make sure sight lines were
clear, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now computer drafting has substantially changed the way his
department spends its time. ``We spend less of the valuable
on-stage time making sure staircases fit and more on lighting and
other nuances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are at work in the lighting room, too, which was once
full of mechanical switches and levers but is now computer
controlled. Michael Hacker, the first assistant electrician, is
responsible for many of the lighting cues entered at the computer
console in the lighting booth, which is at orchestra level.
</P>
<P>
   He is also responsible for pit lighting requirements and for the
room, one level below the stage, where the dimmers are housed.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker is comfortable with the alliance of art and technology,
so often strictly separated in the world beyond the Met. The most
difficult part of his job, he said, is the human factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variables are the people on stage,'' he said. ``They come
in late, they don't stand in the right spot. We have to add,
override and adjust continuously. The computers are the most
reliable part.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If paleoanthropologists from the distant future ever start
digging in your neighborhood, they won't require exotic dating
technology to determine what part of the 20th century they are
rooting around in.
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists discover pie-size, dusty stacks of grooved
vinyl platters, they will have stumbled on a lost record store. But
if they happen upon scads of shiny five-inch plastic disks in
houses, offices, schools, stores, cars and practically everywhere
else, they can assume that they have landed in the closing decades
of this century.
</P>
<P>
   First developed for the mass market in 1985 by Philips
Electronics and Sony Electronics, CDs have rapidly proliferated.
After a slow start, they quickly became the medium of choice for
music companies and listeners because of their large storage
capacity (easily up to 74 minutes of music on a single side), ease
of use and high-fidelity sound reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Compact disks aren't trouble free, but more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Modest estimates place the number of audio CD's and other types
of optical disks (including those containing software or
full-length films) in the tens of billions. More than 2 billion
audio CDs are sold each year in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, optical disks were popular among computer
software publishers looking for better ways to store computer
programs and other data, thus creating the first CD-ROM (read-only
memory). There are now almost 240 million CD-ROM drives installed
in the world's computers, according to the Optical Storage
Technology Association, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the number of uses and types of optical
disks have exploded. There is CD-R (recordable once), CD-RW
(recordable many times), DVD and DVD-ROM (very high-capacity
CD-ROM's that are used mostly to view movies), DVD-RAM (recordable
DVD) and minidisks (three-inch recordable CD's). Applications
include Playstation game disks, photo CDs and digital business and
baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the optical disk is obvious, said Raymond C.
Freeman Jr., who manages the Optical Storage Technology Association
and is president of his own data storage marketing and analysis
company in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``People feel very comfortable
using them, even if the people are nontechnical,'' he said. ``You
pretty much put the disk in a drive and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   While optical disks are far less vulnerable to wear and tear
than vinyl records, optical disks can become scratched and dirty
enough to malfunction. For audio CDs, that usually results in a
kind of sonic hiccup, the digital equivalent of a skip on a vinyl
record. With multimedia disks, such problems can make it impossible
to read the disk at all.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what happens when optical disks do not work, it is
helpful to know what happens when they do.
</P>
<P>
   A laser head, usually mounted on a track, moves a laser beam in
micron-tiny increments a tiny distance from the face of the disk,
which, in the case of music CDs, is spinning at a rate of 200 to
600 revolutions per minute. CD-ROM's spin much faster.
</P>
<P>
   The disk's speed is automatically adjusted to keep the reading
speed constant as the laser starts reading at the inside of the
disk and reaches the outer edges.
</P>
<P>
   What this finely focused laser beam ``sees'' on the disk is a
series of pits and flat surfaces called lands. The microscopic pits
and lands are arranged in a tightly packed spiral; for a CD at full
capacity, or 650 megabytes of data, the spiral, if unraveled, would
be a thread 200 times as thin as a human hair and more than five
miles long.
</P>
<P>
   When the laser strikes a land, the beam bounces back to its
source and is picked up by a detector. When the laser strikes a
pit, the light is diffused and returns to the detector at a
significantly decreased intensity.
</P>
<P>
   As the laser tracks, the detector reads these rapid flashes of
high- and low-intensity signals as offs and ons, or zeros and ones.
That binary data are translated by a microprocessor back into
music, text, graphics or whatever else had been encoded onto the
disk.
</P>
<P>
   Optical disks like CDs are designed to have their data
oversampled _ read many times _ to help correct for errors. But
they still skip when they are dirty or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   A skip can also be caused by a bump that knocks the laser head
off track, much as a phonograph needle skips across a record when
it is bumped. Many portable CD players are equipped with what is
called shock-resistant memory, a kind of data reservoir that stores
what the laser reads. When the laser is disrupted, the player dips
into its reserve memory so the listener never hears the break in
the data stream.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, most of the time.

MAD MAGAZINE: NEW MEDIUM, SAME SMIRK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dignified is not a word one would usually apply to Mad magazine.
Yet Broderbund, in a rare moment of new-media restraint, has
digitized the Mad magazine archive with dignity _ nay, reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively packaged in a sturdy boxed set, along with a toilet
roll of vintage cartoons, the Totally Mad archive presents half a
century of the magazine on seven CD-ROMs: the Early Years; the
Early Years, but Not the Earliest; the Latest of the Early Years;
Somewhere in the Middle Years; the Earliest of the Late Years; the
Relatively Late but Not as Late as the Latest Years; and the Latest
Years.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the anthology is irreverent, down to the system
requirements: ``To run this program properly you should have a
computer. Your computer should also have one of those little
slide-out `snack trays.' Take the snack out and put in one of the
small round CD-ROM things that are in this package.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many digital compendiums, Totally Mad's interface never
overshadows the content. The magazine's first 375 issues are always
front and center, displayed like crown jewels.
</P>
<P>
   The covers, in a vertical array, encapsulate the last 50 years
of pop culture as a portrait of Mad's gap-toothed mascot: Alfred E.
Neuman as Desi Arnaz, Lawrence of Arabia, Patton, Fonzie, Darth
Vader, Bruce Springsteen, Max Headroom. Posing with Superman.
Posing with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. Posing with the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Click on a cover, and that issue of the magazine unfolds as a
series of high-resolution photographs that can be flipped, rotated,
folded and magnified with buttons on a tool bar (at the highest
level of magnification, the pages inflate to 3 by 4 feet, in case
you want to spend a half-hour scrolling across Spy vs. Spy).
Whether anything in Mad deserves that kind of meticulous attention
is debatable, but if you're rabid, it's there.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of the magazine's content can be searched with
the Search-O-Meter or viewed categorically with a click of the More
Garbage Like This button. There's a Back button, a Print command
and a Bookmark function that saves your favorite pages to a file _
the kind of functions one would expect to find in a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   But the interface is smart enough not to force people into
navigating through a magazine as if it were a Web site, because Web
site navigation is generally inferior to magazine navigation. Most
online information lacks any meaningful context, and that's why
it's more frustrating to click from Web page to Web page, bailing
out of useless links, than it is to flip through the pages of a
magazine. Magazines don't make you go back to the table of contents
every time you want to read a new article.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been really easy for the designers of Totally Mad
to give the ratty old-fashioned paper magazine a whole new digital
interface, with a central menu screen and pop-up windows and lists
of links. But instead of doing something different, they did
something right. They celebrated Mad as more than an interesting
collection of images and text. They celebrated it as a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Above and beyond its tribute to a particular comic book, Totally
Mad is a celebration of magazine publishing. It's an argument for
magazine covers and their lasting impact (try remembering the
splash screen of a Web site you saw even 15 seconds ago). And it's
a reminder that interactivity predates point-and-click.
Interactivity is a Mad Fold-In (the Totally Mad interface does
include a Fold button, by the way).
</P>
<P>
   As for user-created content, Mad magazine was doing user-created
content in 1956 with the ``Make Your Own Love Story Comic.'' On one
page were generic cartoon backgrounds, and on the next page,
captions, dialogue balloons and figures: a hunk, a blond bombshell
and emotional outbursts that made Roy Lichtenstein look like a
Hallmark copy writer (``I've been such a fool ... an utter fool! I
thought I could live without you. But I know now that I was wrong!
I know now that I need you ... desperately! You and your money!'')
</P>
<P>
   You could snip and paste, and the result was customized,
user-created content. It's a joke, of course. But for entertainment
value, it compares favorably with many user-created content sites
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what the Mad editorial staff could do if it was
really allowed to flex its muscles online (the potential for Ebay
parodies alone is mind-boggling). But in the meantime, we have the
first half-century of the magazine. Between the boxed set and the
toilet roll, it gets the treatment it deserves.

AUSTRALIAN OINTMENT CAUSING A BUZZ AMONG ARTHRITIS PATIENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HURST, Texas _ It looks like axle grease and smells like
molasses and curry powder mixed with motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   It's messy to use and has been nicknamed ``the goo from Down
Under'' or simply, ``the goop.''
</P>
<P>
   And it costs $98 for an 8-ounce jar.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthritis Relief Plus contains many herbal ingredients
traditionally used to relieve pain and swelling, plus some credited
with rebuilding bones and joints. They are mixed in a coconut oil
base that some arthritis sufferers say carries the herbs deep into
damaged joints.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation classifies the ointment as an
``unproven remedy'' and says that topical pain relievers should be
used as part of a comprehensive program, but North Texas arthritis
sufferers who have used the ointment say they have found some
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Beebe, 75, of Colleyville, began arthritis treatments when
she was 28. She was given cortisone injections, wore copper
bracelets and strapped on magnets seeking pain relief. In January
1984, she had her right hip replaced with a steel ball and plastic
socket.
</P>
<P>
   She says she took anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers until
her doctor made her stop because she was developing stomach ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just putting up with it,'' she says. ``Some days were
worse than others. I had to have help stepping off or on a curb. My
son put an extra step at the back door to make it easier to get in
and out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in here last January with a cane,'' she says at the
Arthritis Relief Center in Hurst, which a neighbor recommended. ``I
told my neighbor that it won't work; but you hurt so bad, you're
willing to try anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Beebe says she told her doctor in July that he would laugh when
he heard how she finally relieved the pain in her right hand and
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't laugh at anything that works,' '' said
Beebe, who says her arthritis pain ended after 30 days of using
Arthritis Relief Plus _ and hasn't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Allen Martin, 77, of Hurst, who had his left knee
replaced and was considering a knee replacement on the right side
when his wife, Billie, dragged him over to the Arthritis Relief
Center in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery relieved pain in the left leg, but it is still a little
stiff, despite six weeks of physical therapy. For a month after the
surgery, her husband declared it ``the biggest mistake of his
life,'' Billie Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   He tried Arthritis Relief Plus, but after three or four weeks he
declared it ``a good idea that's just not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Martin persevered, rubbing in the cream all around his
knee and lightly wrapping it with an elastic bandage each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 30th day, he said, `I hate to say this, but the pain's
gone. My leg's not hurting anymore,' '' Billie Martin says. Allen
Martin is back at work doing carpentry repairs and maintenance
around the town houses where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis Relief Plus was developed in Australia 20 years ago to
help rehabilitate injured race horses and dogs. It was reformulated
several years ago in a less grainy ointment for humans, says Marta
Matthews, an Australian native who introduced the alternative pain
relief cream in this country about 18 months ago when she opened
the Arthritis Relief Center in Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   She sells primarily over the Internet and on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The herbal ointment is rubbed in at night and the affected joint
is wrapped lightly to keep the ointment from rubbing off and making
a mess. As with other topical pain relievers for arthritis, it
usually takes two to four weeks to begin working.
</P>
<P>
   To what do the ointment's advocates attribute its success?
</P>
<P>
   First, it contains capsaicin, a substance found in hot peppers,
which relieves pain by interfering with pain signals to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains English oak, an astringent shown to reduce
swelling; turmeric, an astringent with anti-inflammatory and
antibiotic properties, traditionally used on sprains and bruises;
winter cherry to relieve joint and nerve pain; fenugreek to soothe
inflamed tissue; Norwegian kelp for mineral deficiencies; Solomon's
seal (''knit-bone'') to help heal bones and bruising; and menthol.
</P>
<P>
   With no known side effects, the treatment is a welcome
alternative therapy for some. A recent research review published in
the New England Journal of Medicine found that traditional
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administered to treat
arthritis _ including aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium _ can
cause gastrointestinal ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is low, but because huge numbers of people take these
pain relievers, especially arthritis sufferers who take high doses
for long periods, toxicity from the drugs ranks as the
15th-most-common cause of death in the United States, says a report
in the September-October issue of Fitness Matters, the journal of
the American Council on Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthritis is not terminal, it's just debilitating,'' Matthews
says. ``What gets you in the end are the side effects to the drugs.
This has no side effects and doesn't interfere with any other drugs
you may be taking. If your knee hurts, you put it on your knee. If
your hand hurts, put it on your hand. There's no need for it to go
through your whole system.''

<P>
   This has been a big month for mice. First, a biologist at
Princeton disclosed that he had genetically engineered a smarter
mouse with improved learning, memory and intelligence skills, and
now the technologists in Microsoft's hardware division have
digitally engineered a new batch of smarter, more talented computer
mice.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining fundamentally unchanged for a long time _
millions of years, in the case of biological mice, and more than
three decades for computer mice _ we are now at the dawn of a new
era of super mice.
</P>
<P>
   The new Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer is, quite simply, the
cat's meow. The five-button Explorer mouse has a voluptuous silver
body with a glowing red tail light and a translucent red underbelly
that lights up a room at night. And this is no blind mouse: It uses
optical sensors to find its way around with greater precision than
any conventional mechanical mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will not be formally released until Oct. 1, the new
mouse is starting to show up in some stores at a price just a
whisker under $75. The Explorer is just one of several new mice
being introduced by Microsoft, including a more modest optical
mouse for $55 and a new cordless mouse for $45 that is buried
somewhere under the clutter on my desk.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that $75 is a lot to pay for a mouse, especially when a
new PC system can be had for less than $500 and when serviceable
replacement mice are widely sold for less than $10. But like the
brainy rodents in the laboratories at Princeton, the Intellimouse
Explorer is no ordinary mouse.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary mouse typically has a rubber ball embedded in its
belly. As the ball rolls over a surface, little mechanical rollers
measure the speed and direction of the mouse and adjust the
on-screen cursor accordingly. Computer mice have worked this way
since Douglas Englebart cobbled the first mouse out of wood and
wheels in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer has no mechanical or moving parts. Instead, a small
digital camera about the size of a pinhead snaps a picture of the
underlying surface 1,500 times a second. The images are analyzed by
a super-fast chip called a digital signal processor, which compares
each new picture with the previous one and detects patterns of
movement. It measures the changes and calculates the new mouse
position with exquisite precision. Microsoft calls this optical
technology Intellieye, which proves how dangerous it can be to let
engineers name the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The result is more accurate cursor movements on the computer
screen. Granted, the typical mechanical mouse is hardly inaccurate,
and a casual mouse-pusher is not going to notice a life-changing
difference. But engineers, graphic artists and others who measure
precision by the pixel will love it.
</P>
<P>
   Another result is better mouse hygiene. Because the Explorer
mouse has no rubber ball constantly sweeping across a mousepad
gathering crumbs and fuzz, it does not accumulate the kind of
belly-button lint that causes mechanical mice to skip, get stuck or
lose their bearings. Some people enjoy tweezering the lint out of
mouse bellies. Getting this optical mouse will make it easier to
avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Still another virtue of the new mouse is its versatility. Unlike
Macintosh mice, which use a single mouse button, or standard PC
mice, which employ two buttons, left and right, the Explorer mouse
has five buttons, including a scrolling wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolling wheel has evolved in response to the World Wide
Web. Web pages rarely fit in one screen so the user usually has to
mouse over to a scroll bar and click up or down. This is not
exactly Sisyphean as hardships go, but it does become tiresome
after a few zillion pages.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, PC mice have added Web wheels between their left and
right ears. Rolling the wheel with a finger has the same effect as
clicking and dragging on a vertical scroll bar. Roll forward, and
the page scrolls up; roll backward, the page scrolls down. The
wheel also functions as a click button.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer mouse has a wheel, but it also adds a fourth and a
fifth mouse button on its left side. The buttons are factory-set as
Forward and Back, as in, go to the next Web page, go back to the
previous Web page. As more software applications adopt a
browserlike command structure, that is a time-saver.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the five buttons can be easily customized, to Cut and
Paste, for example, instead of Forward and Back. Or Maximize and
Minimize, or Select All and Copy, or even Switch Weapons and Blast
the Aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are not aware of how much silliness is programmed
into their mouse software, and the Intellisense software that comes
with the Intellimice is amusing as well as functional. Using the
mouse controls in the Windows Control Panel, for example, one can
replace the boring arrow pointer and hourglass waiting symbol with
a tap-dancer in top hat and tails and a martini with an olive. Or
one can dump the arrow in favor of an ear of corn or a snake or (my
favorite) a mouse. You can also replace the hourglass with a block
of Swiss cheese that is slowly nibbled away.
</P>
<P>
   As fond as I am of this clever, stylish new mouse, it has some
potential drawbacks. First, it threatens to make mousepads
obsolete. My beloved Grateful Dead mousepads are an integral part
of my pigpen office decor, and the Explorer mouse makes them
superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the new mouse works just as well on a
Grateful Dead T-shirt (even one being worn by someone else, which
can be fun) as it does on a desktop. It navigates on trouser legs,
magazines or bare skin _ on nearly any surface with the major
exception of glass. Glass confuses the mouse's video eyeball, so
glass-top desks are out.
</P>
<P>
   The new mouse is hard cheese for lefties. The Intellimouse
Explorer is designed for right-handers only, and Microsoft says it
has no plans to create a version for southpaws.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some consolation in that the same optical
technology is being incorporated into the less flashy but equally
precise and ambidextrous Intellimouse that costs $55. The all-white
Intellimouse with Intellieye lacks the swooping curves, silver
skin, glowing tail light and fourth and fifth buttons of the
Explorer, but it does have the optical precision and a glowing red
belly button.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft initially designed the new optical mice for Windows
computers, but the Universal Serial Bus, or USB, versions can
easily replace the nasty little puck pointer that Apple ships with
its Macintosh and iMac computers, and the silver Explorer mouse
even color-coordinates beautifully with the new graphite G4 desktop
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   That joyous news is tempered somewhat by the need for Mac users
to download 1.6 megabytes worth of beta software drivers from
Microsoft to get the Explorer mouse to run properly. Final code is
scheduled to be available on Oct. 1. (Windows users must have
Windows 98 Second Edition.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft is also introducing a traditional mouse with
its tail cut off. This cordless radio mouse is intended for people
who prize neatness, the sort who probably got a flat-screen monitor
just to accentuate how much uncluttered desk space they have and
who probably bundle all the computer cables together with
color-coded plastic ties and hide them behind a fern. In short, the
kind of people who get pleasure from cleaning the lint off mouse
balls.
</P>
<P>
   The radio mouse comes with a receiver about the size of a pack
of cigarettes, which attaches to the computer. The mouse then
communicates with the receiver at distances up to about 5 feet and
works about as well as a mouse with a cord.

ASK NOT WHICH HOUSE IS REAL, BUT WHETHER REALITY IS 
</HEADLINE>

   WEIMAR, Germany _ Postcards of this city's most famous building
look different this year. The little pale-blue cottage is still
depicted in its verdant setting in Ilm Park, but an identical twin
structure is featured in some images. A provocative bit of text
appears, too: ``Echt?'' (``Real?'')
</P>
<P>
   The building is Goethe's Garden House, a national shrine. Weimar
has been enjoying a year as the European Union's ``cultural
capital,'' a designation prompted by Goethe's 250th birthday, in
August. Rather than simply polish up the city's many landmarks, the
organizers challenged their visitors with an experimental conjuring
trick. They built an exact copy of the Garden House 100 yards from
the original.
</P>
<P>
   The project was the brainchild of Lorenz Engell, the dean of
media studies at Bauhaus University here and a man eager to provoke
essential questions about authenticity. The intricacies of
determining what is ``real'' have particular relevance in this
postwar landscape, where great tracts of the national heritage were
destroyed and have had to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Engell persuaded the organizers that a second Garden House would
be a valuable challenge to the cult of the original. The resulting
architectural pas de deux has forced everyone _ Weimar residents,
tourists and intellectuals alike _ to ponder modernist issues of
reproduction and originality. Some have been bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe was a man of tremendous energy, curiosity and engagement,
not only the spur of German humanism, creator of the epic drama
``Faust'' and unsurpassed poet of his age, but also government
minister, botanist, geologist, painter, designer and philosopher.
Almost from the moment he arrived in Weimar in 1776 until his death
in 1832, his favorite place was his modest house by a bend in the
Ilm River, a short stroll from the center of what was then a
tranquil provincial capital with 5,000 inhabitants. For Germans,
the Garden House represents the blossoming and pure spirit of
German classicism, its simplicity and intimacy accessible even to
those who have never heard of ``Egmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer was 26 and already famous when he was summoned to the
court of Grand Duke Carl August, who immediately raised him to a
peerage, made him a minister and bought him a temporary house to
live in, at a cost of 600 taler (about $1,000 now). The house dated
back at least to the end of the 16th century, when it served as a
wine shed.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe engaged 26 workers for the renovation, including the
Duke's own cabinetmaker, J.M. Mieding. The paved rooms of the
ground floor included a foyer, a kitchen, a dining room and
servants' quarters, while the upper floor became Goethe's private
realm _ a tiny suite of library, writing room, parlor and bedroom.
Goethe was most interested in the garden, a labor of love that
engaged him until the end of his life. What was a tangle of weeds
and brush became a charming network of terraces, pebbled pathways,
lanes of vegetables and flower beds rife with hollyhocks, violets
and roses.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Goethe moved into a sprawling mustard-colored
mansion with its own garden on the Frauenplan. But he kept his
Garden House. There, embedded in nature, he heard the muse most
clearly, and he arranged his writing room just so, to hear her
call. Improbably perched high on a suede saddle chair of his own
design, his feet dangling and his back to a conical sheet metal
stove, he wrote many of his finest works, including ``Wilhelm
Meister's Apprenticeship,'' ``Iphigenia in Tauris'' and ``Torquato
Tasso.''
</P>
<P>
   In the garden he pondered whether there might have been a primal
plant from which all others evolved. In the dining room he talked
theater with Schiller and philosophy with Herder. In the parlor he
received his friend the Grand Duke and discussed the advent of
Napoleon, and in the bedroom he found unexpected passion with
Christiane Vulpius, a young woman with whom he lived for 18 years
before they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar's cultural events are not all devoted to the writer, of
course; the highs and lows of the 20th century are also being
deeply scrutinized. But Goethe's second Garden House may be the
most quietly subversive provocation of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Laier, its planner and construction manager, reproduced
everything, including the patina and traces of use, ``from the
threshold to the roof ridge,'' he said recently. The second house
has the same pale-blue plastered walls, narrow shuttered windows
and weathered gray shingles. The beige sandstone paving of the
foyer and dining room looks scuffed and pitted. On the threshold of
Goethe's dining room, the doors have scratched minute concentric
circles into the stone during centuries of pivoting. The same
circles are under the impostor's hinges.
</P>
<P>
   Laier explained that the second Garden House was designed in 73
prefabricated sections. ``You can take it on tour,'' he said. ``It
all fits into containers.'' The precision is uncanny. The wooden
staircase and the wide floorboards look raw and rounded, as if
pounded by the boots of four generations. The plain interior is
replicated down to Goethe's rostrum writing table, smoothed by a
waxy polish that might have come from the poet's own sweaty palms.
The wear and tear of 200 years is, impossibly, everywhere evident:
200-year-old grime was simulated in nooks and crannies with green
umber pigment and linseed oil.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most hurried tourist will notice the only two major
differences: the second Garden House has no guards and no garden.
Everything can be touched. You can sit on Goethe's copy saddle and
see if you are inspired. But nature is harder to reproduce. Wooden
gates, pebble mosaics and benches are here, but none of the
glorious flora that give the house its name.
</P>
<P>
   Laier now believes that ``the copy has become an original,'' a
critical folly outside the bounds of history. To Engell,
paradoxically, the original is itself a copy, since it represents
only the way people understand the house at this point in time.
Authenticity is always open to interpretation; the various
restorations and re-restorations of the Garden House _ imperial,
communist, democratic _ is evidence enough for academics. But
judging the real is no esoteric matter in Germany.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Few other countries have such expertise in reconstruction.
Gutted ruins like the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin and the
Wuerzburg Palace were immaculately restored to glory, as if the
bombing had never happened. Dresden is turning the blackened rubble
that was once the Frauenkirche into a reassembled phoenix. There
are proposals to rebuild Berlin's Royal Palace, whose ruins were
demolished by the Communists in 1950. Aside from questions about
the cost, some have asked whether the resulting palace would still
be the palace. To what extent would visitors feel the ``aura,'' as
the German philosopher Walter Benjamin famously described the
emanation of reality, while visiting what they know to be a fraud?
</P>
<P>
   And this line of questioning extends to the darkest focus of
reproduction restoration: Buchenwald, whose rusting gates are
almost visible from the window of Goethe's writing room. Is there
not an irony involved in the retrieval of history with a
simulation? Is memory served at a concentration camp when the very
methods used to preserve it inevitably lead to the diminution of
the ``real''?
</P>
<P>
   The people of Weimar, surprisingly, have embraced the replica of
their chief cult object in the same way that federal politicians
eventually decided that Christo's wrapping of the Reichstag was not
so bad an idea after all. Seventy percent of Weimar citizens want
to keep it after the birthday year is over. At least half the
nearly 1,000 people who visit the second Garden House daily know
that it is a copy and are eager to see just how precise it is. The
unsuspecting other half pay their 5 marks ($2.65) for a quick tour
and leave, feeling the perhaps false glow of a brush with the
German bard. Others are confused or angry upon suddenly seeing the
original house across the way, with its garden and 4 marks'
admission. They too have been an essential part of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Weimar will soon nestle under the comforting blanket of
a World Heritage Site designation. But the Sparkasse bank has not
decided what to do with the second Garden House when it is removed
at the end of October. Perhaps it will tour the world, as Laier
designed it to do, a floating signifier without a context, a shrine
in search of new pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seem satisfied that, come what may, the appeal of
the original will remain mysteriously palpable. As Walter
Benjamin's age of mechanical reproduction becomes digital and
genetic, it is no wonder that many crave the intimacy and peace of
identity, the smell of leather and creak of wood, the nearness to
something that happened long ago and only once. As a German woman
clutching two wriggling children prepared to leave the custom-built
sleight of hand, she discovered that she had been conned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `copy'?'' she barked at a man behind the
desk. ``I want the real thing!''
</P>
<P>
   Laier just smiled and patted the lintel on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Garden Houses are at Corona-Schroeter-Weg, Ilm Park,
Weimar. Information for the replica, open daily through October:
011-49-3643-81-99-17. The original is open November to March and

DUST THAT MAY HAVE EYES AND EARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass.)   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you watch dust motes drifting in the air,
consider: Someday the dust motes may be watching you.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley are
designing tiny airborne devices they call ``smart dust'' that may
one day not only observe the likes of lost cats, tornadoes or even
enemy forces but also pass the news along to headquarters, wherever
that may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of smart dust is to combine sensors, computation and
communication in a volume as small as a grain of sand,'' said its
inventor, Kris Pister, a Berkeley professor who is leading the
effort to put a complete airborne sensing and communication
platform _ including power supply _ inside one cubic millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Pister hopes that one day his smart dust will be ubiquitous.
Grains of it could be used for tasks like monitoring a room's
temperature to make sure that people in one side of the room do not
freeze while those in the other side bake.
</P>
<P>
   Smart dust may even have a more stealthy purpose. Joseph Kahn, a
professor of electrical engineering and computer science at
Berkeley who has worked closely on the project with Pister, said he
could imagine a future in which ``microaircraft drop smart dust on
the perimeter of a battlefield to measure data like movement of
vehicles.'' Another microaircraft could interrogate the smart dust
to find out what it had seen.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to worry yet about the invasion of privacy by
dust motes, or even about inhaling them. Pister's dust grains are
still a relatively bulky five millimeters on a side, the size of an
aspirin _ far too heavy to be wafted on air currents.
</P>
<P>
   But Pister and his group have the individual parts of the system
working, he said, and they have already demonstrated an autonomous,
golf-ball-size sensor that can beam weather information by laser
from Coit Tower in San Francisco 10 miles across the bay to
Pister's Berkeley office.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that the motes will soon be airy enough to float alone,
sensing and communicating either with a central device or mote to
mote.
</P>
<P>
   Pister's smart dust, and dozens of other tiny machines, are made
possible by a technology known as MEMS, short for
microelectromechanical systems. MEMS are miniature machines, some
smaller than a human red blood cell, that are built in the same way
as integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Materials are deposited in a three-dimensional stack on a
silicon base and whittled and shaped using photolithography, in
which ultraviolet light is used for etching. An acid bath at the
end washes away unwanted pieces, leaving tiny hinges, rotors or
other mechanical elements of the minute silicon machines.
</P>
<P>
   As futuristic as mite-size machines like smart dust may sound,
several commercial applications of MEMS have already made the leap
from the laboratory to the prototype stage and into production.
Many more are expected in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices, for example, makes dot-size motion sensors that
are deployed in airbags, said Jim Doscher, marketing manager of the
company's micromachine product division in Cambridge, Mass. The
sensors measure deceleration and signal a microchip, which decides
``if the signal is a bad parking job or a crash,'' Doscher said.
Because MEMS take advantage of the photolithographic techniques
used in integrated circuit technology, they are fairly inexpensive
to mass produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensors that used to cost hundreds of dollars now cost $5,''
Doscher said. Earlier systems had several detectors the size of
soda cans wired together to trigger an airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Doscher sees part of the future of MEMS in cell phones and
personal digital assistants that will respond to the shake of a
hand. ``The sensors will measure common human motions and turn them
into actions,'' he predicted. For instance, a user may very soon
shake a cell phone once to awaken it, tilt it a certain way to see
a list of names and give it a few more shakes to hang up.
</P>
<P>
   But people in the field say MEMS will soon be used for far more
than motion detection, as handy as that may be. At Lucent
Technologies' Bell Laboratories, for instance, scientists have
already created MEMS-based prototypes as exotic as an optical
microscope the size of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   They are also working on micromirrors to enhance fiber optic
communications. At present, when light reaches the end of a fiber
optic cable, it must be converted into electricity to be useful;
that occurs, for example, during the back and forth of Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``An optical fiber is capable of broadcasting a semi-infinite
amount of information,'' said Dr. David Bishop, head of the
micromechanics research department at Bell Laboratories. ``But
right now you can't say that for the end of the fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and his colleagues, like researchers at other companies,
hope to speed up Internet connections with all-optical switching,
which would use arrays of micromirrors to guide the light beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can shine an optical beam on the micromirrors,'' Bishop
said, ``so that light coming out of the fiber is rerouted'' to
other fibers going all the way to the computer. ``There will be no
need to convert the signal back into electrons,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop foresees a time when optical light guiding will permit a
petabit (a quantity of bits equal to the number 1 followed by 15
zeros) of signals to be switched each second. A terabit _ the limit
of many mortal imaginations _ is a relatively paltry number of
bits: 1 followed by 12 zeros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can imagine building a switch to handle a petabit of data
per second coming out of the pipe,'' he said. ``The mirrors don't
care how big the signal is so we can build an optical switch that
is data independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said MEMS might be the devices that lead to a world with
smart dust and other wonders. ``Armies of us are trying to make
this happen,'' he said.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My overhead garage door was installed when the house was
built about nine years ago. It is still working normally, but for
the past few months it has been making a lot of squealing and
squeaking noises every time I open it. I have done nothing to this
door since we moved in as I was never told that any maintenance was
required. Does this type of door require lubrication or maintenance
of any kind?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Regular lubrication of all moving parts once every year
or two with a light oil. This includes the torsion springs or
balancing springs (depending on the type of hardware on the door),
the lock hardware and the various cables connecting the lifting
mechanism to the door. The shafts and bearings of the steel rollers
inside the tracks on each side of the door also need regular
lubrication (nylon rollers should not be oiled). However, you
should not apply oil to the inside of the tracks. When lubricating
you should also check all bolts and other fasteners to make sure
they are still tight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a very heavy rain I get water trickling in under my
basement window. This window faces uphill and is below ground level
and surrounded by a metal ``window well'' or low wall so that water
runs down off the hill and often accumulates inside the well. Is
there some simple way I can solve this water problem without having
to excavate and waterproof the foundation wall?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although excavating around the outside and waterproofing the
outside of this wall (in addition to installing drain tile along
the footing) is probably the best solution, you may be able to
divert the water that runs off the hill so it won't accumulate
inside the window well. Dig a 12-inch deep and 12-inch-to-18-inch
wide trench on the hill parallel to the house and at least 10 feet
uphill from the foundation. The trench should extend past the house
at each end, and should be filled with gravel. Water coming off the
hill will then be caught by the trench and diverted around each
side of the house so that it won't accumulate against the house
wall or inside the window well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One plaster ceiling on the second floor of my old house shows
a damp spot all the time, causing the paint to peel constantly. The
spot is not near any outside wall and there are no signs of a leak
in the attic above it. Do you have any idea what could possibly be
causing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is most likely due to condensation developing on the attic
roof beams or under the attic insulation. This then drips down onto
the top of the ceiling and soaks into the plaster. The condensation
is often due to a lack of adequate ventilation in the attic _ maybe
because some of the vents along the eaves are blocked or because
the attic simply needs more vents along the eaves and up near the
roof ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ceilings and walls in my house have developed a number of
fine hairline cracks. What is the best way to repair them before I
repaint?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the cracks are only in the paint, then it is likely a
paint failure _ the paint itself is cracking or ``alligatoring''
due to poor application, inadequate drying time between coats,
improper thinning, or failure to prepare the surface properly
beforehand. If this is the case then sanding and filling the cracks
with vinyl or acrylic spackling compound before repainting will
usually solve the problem. If your walls are plaster then it is
also possible that the plaster under the paint is cracking, but
here again, patching with a spackling compound should do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``GARAGE DOOR OPENER'' goes with this
column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Garage door extension springs, torsion springs,
pulleys, cables and steel rollers, should all be lubricated with a
light oil every year or two.

 &HT;    Anti-theft devices improve chances that car will be there when
you get back
 &HT;    By Michelle C. Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beep-Beep.
</P>
<P>
   Beeeeep, Beeeeeeeep, eeeeee, errrrrrrrr, eeeeEEE, errrrRRRR.
</P>
<P>
   Blip-Blip.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, it's hard to miss the car alarm chorus. From
flashing lights to honking horns to synthesized voices stating,
``ARMED _ DISARMED,'' they've caught our attention.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. According to the Highway Loss Data
Institute, anti-theft devices reduce the risk of your vehicle being
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Which means those noisemakers really do work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-theft devices cut theft losses by 50 percent,'' says Kim
Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the highway institute, a
private, nonprofit research organization whose funding comes from
the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Once the domain of joy-riding teens and chop shops, auto theft
has become a thriving export industry in recent years. Hazelbaker
estimates that millions of dollars worth of vehicles are stolen
annually throughout the United States and taken overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto theft is a sophisticated export business in this
country,'' says Hazelbaker. ``(U.S.) Customs folks do a good job,
but estimate they are only finding 1 percent to 2 percent. It is a
huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though anti-theft devices have shown they are an important
factor in reducing theft, you won't see the savings on your
insurance rates just yet. Although laws and regulations in 13
states require a lower comprehensive coverage rate for vehicles
with anti-theft devices, Georgia is not one of these states. But,
as claims are reduced, rates will stabilize and all consumers will
benefit, says Dave Hurst, public affairs liaison for State Farm
Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   In an ever-pressing race to stay ahead of criminals and protect
autos, companies have responded with a wealth of anti-theft
options.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which anti-theft device you choose, make sure it is
installed by a certified professional who has had special training
to install electronic equipment in your vehicle. Look for training
and certifications such as Mobile Electronics Certified
Professional.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the type of security system, a basic line of
defense against theft is locking your doors, taking your keys with
you and keeping valuables out of sight. Most experts agree that
anti-theft devices don't necessarily prevent theft, but in many
instances they will slow the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any anti-theft device is better than none, but no anti-theft
device guarantees that your car will not be taken,'' says police
Lt. D.W. Dunlap with the Atlanta Police Department's auto theft
division. ``They just lessen the likelihood.''

 &HT;    An overview of vehicle anti-theft systems
 &HT;    By Michelle Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alarms
</P>
<P>
   Car alarms work much like home security systems. Instead of a
keypad, the alarm is set with a remote control. When the car's
security is breached, sirens wail, horns honk and lights flash.
Depending on the type of alarm, consumers can add features such as
keyless entry, keyless locking, pain-generating sirens, window and
sunroof control and auto-start.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burney, an installer with Gwinnett Sound in Norcross (Ga.),
says that when purchasing an alarm system, it's important to
consider the type of vehicle and the options you want to add.
``Look at what type of protection you want,'' Burney says.
</P>
<P>
   Basic alarms start at about $200 but are limited in their
features. That's why Scott Carroll, mobile electronics specialist
for American Radio Cellular &AMP; Paging in Marietta (Ga.), encourages
customers to think long term.
</P>
<P>
   Alarms have ``channels'' that enable you to add features. If you
purchase an alarm with a limited number of channels and want to add
features later on, you may end up having to replace the entire
alarm, Carroll says.
</P>
<P>
   Having an anti-theft device that depends on catching the
attention of others raises concerns that no one will notice.
Carroll doesn't give that concern much weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a load of wash, '' he says. ``It is human nature that
when you hear a noise, you're going to look.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dion Bentley of Clarkston (Ga.), having a car alarm serves
to protect his 1994 Honda Accord from small-time thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an alarm to stop the little would-be criminal from joy
riding,'' says Bentley, 28. ``I know it can't stop a professional,
but I am trying to prevent the snatch-and-grab criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Passive devices
</P>
<P>
   Several auto manufacturers are equipping their vehicles with
anti-theft devices. Connected through the key, these passive
devices set automatically and require no effort on the part of the
driver. If the vehicle is broken into, the starter is disabled. The
hassle to consumers comes if the key is lost: Replacement keys can
be purchased only through the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Having an alarm that sets itself and is not easily turned off is
what Niccole McLeod, 28, of Lilburn (Ga.) likes about the passive
system in her 1992 Acura Legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the car alarm is going off and I put the key in the
ignition, it will not crank,'' says McLeod. ``I have to put the key
in the door on the outside to disable the alarm. If a person grabs
my key, they can't start the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle location systems
</P>
<P>
   One of the first vehicle location systems to hit the market was
LoJack. Vehicles with LoJack are equipped with a special
transmitter hidden somewhere within the vehicle. When the vehicle
is stolen, the owner notifies authorities. The police, in
conjunction with the National Crime Information Computer Network,
activate the transmitter, which then sends out a coded signal
specific to the stolen vehicle. Police use special locators to pick
up the signal and follow it so the vehicle can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Walters of Griffin (Ga.) purchased his 1996
Chevrolet Blazer, he knew that the popular sport-utility vehicle is
a favorite among thieves. That knowledge prompted him to purchase a
LoJack system through the car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most definitely would recommend it,'' says Walters, 27. ``If
anything does happen, you get your stuff back _ it is guaranteed by
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also several other vehicle location systems to choose
from, including OnGuard, Force Tracker and Air Command. Some of the
newer designs use global positioning technology.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring systems
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the U.S. Defense Department began launching a series of
tracking satellites known as the Global Positioning System, which
became fully operational in 1994. This technology an locate your
exact position anywhere on earth. Designed for military use, the
system is now also used for nonmilitary navigation and to track and
locate, among other things, stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Taking this technology a step further and combining it with a
cellular telephone, monitoring systems do everything but wash the
car.
</P>
<P>
   For a monthly fee, the vehicle is connected to a fully staffed
call center. At the touch of a button, the call center can locate
your vehicle, start the engine, unlock the doors, honk the horn,
dispatch emergency assistance and even make hotel reservations for
you. If you're lost while driving, the call center can tell you
when and where to turn to find your way home.
</P>
<P>
   For emergencies, the vehicle is equipped with a panic button.
When pressed, it alerts the call center to listen in anonymously,
track the vehicle with the use of GPS and alert the proper
authorities to come to your aid.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these systems to hit the market recently are Alpine's
Mayday and OnStar.
</P>
<P>
   Steering wheel locks
</P>
<P>
   Steering wheel locks are usually made of steel and prevent the
wheel from turning. They attach in two places on the wheel and can
be unlocked only with a key. The most common brand is The Club,
whose slogan is ``If you can't steer it, you can't steal it.''
</P>

   Types of anti-theft devices:
</P>
<P>
   Alarms
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What do they do:
</P>
<P>
   A basic alarm is connected to the vehicle's electronic system
and attracts attention through sirens, flashing lights and honking
horns when the vehicle's security is violated. Most such alarm
systems also prevent the vehicle from being started. Other features
can be added.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's out there:
</P>
<P>
   There are a vast number of brands on the market, among them
Avital, Auto Page, Viper and Crimestopper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect to pay:
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $150 to $199 for a basic alarm, which usually
includes a control unit, a siren and a key-chain remote control.
Cost increases depending on the features added.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Effectiveness:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fine for deterring joy riders,'' says police
detective E.S. Hopper, who oversees the DeKalb Police Department's
auto-theft unit. ``It would only be a two-second slowdown for a
professional thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle location systems
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What do they do:
</P>
<P>
   A special transmitter hidden within the vehicle sends out a
coded signal when activated. Police use a special tracking system
to pick up the vehicle's signal and follow it so it can be
recovered. Some of the newer designs use Global Positioning System
technology.
</P>
<P>
   What's out there:
</P>
<P>
   Brands available include OnGuard, Force Tracker, Air Command and
LoJack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect to pay:
</P>
<P>
   Basic systems retail for around $600; extra features can be
added at extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Effectiveness:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it (LoJack) work,'' says Hopper. ``I thought it was
quite amazing. If you see an unmarked (patrol) car going down the
road with four antennas, it has LoJack. The LoJack company has
furnished these units to departments for use.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring systems
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What do they do:
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Global Positioning System, monitoring systems go a
step further. For a monthly fee, you can add a variety of services.
Hooked into the vehicle with GPS technology and a cellular
telephone, the monitoring service can offer roadside assistance,
directions and, if a panic button is pressed, emergency service.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's out there:
</P>
<P>
   Brands recently hitting the market include Alpine Mobile Mayday,
CarCop and On-star.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect to pay:
</P>
<P>
   $1,000 and up depending on features.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Effectiveness:
</P>
<P>
   ``The location of the vehicle can be checked on demand,'' Hopper
says. ``One drawback with GPS: If the car is placed in a garage, it
is more difficult to locate.''
</P>
<P>
   Passive devices
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What do they do:
</P>
<P>
   Passive anti-theft devices, once activated, disable a vehicle's
ability to start. Several car manufacturers make them available as
standard or optional equipment.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and Honda are two of the automakers who equip
their vehicles with passive devices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect to pay:
</P>
<P>
   Check with your car dealer to see if this is a standard or
optional feature. Prices vary by manufacturer and dealer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Effectiveness:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good, but professionals have figured a way around it,''
says Hopper. ``Your joy rider is going to have problems with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steering wheel locks
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What do they do:
</P>
<P>
   Made of steel, they lock onto the steering wheel and can be
unlocked only with a key.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's out there:
</P>
<P>
   The best-known brand is The Club.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect to pay:
</P>
<P>
   These are the easiest devices to buy. They're available at mass
merchandisers including discount stores, automotive parts stores
and hardware stores. Prices start at $25.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Effectiveness:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a basic-level anti-theft device,'' says Hopper. ``Good
for deterring joy riders; not a deterrent against professionals.
You can probably pick one up at a garage sale.''

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Ellijay
 &HT;    State's apple capital invites you to have a bite
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the core of this North Georgia town that calls itself the
state's apple capital is a warmth that makes visitors feel right at
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of less than 2,000 _ and a share of Gilmer
County's annual bumper crop of more than a half million apples _
Ellijay easily provides a charming small-town atmosphere
highlighted by a courthouse square that looks as if it could double
as a movie set. Add to this a backdrop of rolling hills shadowed by
the Chattahoochee National Forest and the Appalachian Mountains and
you've got quite a picturesque setting.
</P>
<P>
   Anchored by the elegant courthouse, built as a hotel in 1897,
the square offers plenty of shopping opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is a perfect time to visit, as the apple houses outside of
town are brimming with Winesaps, Romes, Granny Smiths and Arkansas
reds along with those old favorites Red and Yellow Delicious. And
if you plan your trek in mid-October, you can drop by the Ellijay
Apple Festival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first places you might want to visit on the square is
Apple Country Station, where you're sure to get a real home-style
welcome. Push open the door of this turn-of-the century building,
which houses a furniture and gift store, and the first item to
catch your eye is a handsome bed covered with a vast array of small
well-dressed stuffed critters from the Boyd's Bear collection.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are it won't be long before Rudy McVey, who owns the
place with his wife, Mary, comes over and welcomes you to his
``home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We set the store up like a house, so you can see how the
merchandise is going to look in your home,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you wander to the upstairs showrooms you'll think
you've walked into someone's private home. In a way, you have.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago the McVeys moved to the area from
Brooksville, Fla., and couldn't find much in the way of housing, so
they built an elegant, spacious apartment on the top floor. Today
the space is appointed with fine furnishings, collectibles and
artwork. It boasts a huge kitchen, where the McVeys hold special
gatherings for customers and locals.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down at Antiques and More, the shopper with an eye
for ancient treasures can while away a good chunk of time browsing
through 42 dealers' booths.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Frances Reddick own one of the booths that offers
merchandise from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last year and a half, Ellijay has really started to
come into its own as an antiques shopping place,'' Charles Reddick
says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple travels about twice a year to England on buying trips
and fills their booth with china, carved walking sticks and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   At Nelle Hefner's booth you'll find a desk that once was an
organ rescued from a local chicken house, a time-worn stagecoach
writing desk, china from occupied Japan and even a corn liquor jug
that she swears was used for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The store also carries an impressive collection of locally
carved totem poles and coins.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to visit while Hefner's around, you could
pick up some quick antiques know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world's made up of reproductions, honey,'' she says.
``Think about it, there's just not enough real antiques to go
around.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who have sterling salt and pepper shakers, she
cautions never to leave salt in them for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll eat 'em up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ellijay also offers a little bit of Christmas year-round. At the
beautiful white Victorian called the Christmas House, decorated
trees beckon from the bay windows.
</P>
<P>
   For Lynette Davies of Lawrenceville, nothing can keep her from a
store filled with treasures for her favorite season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up here because I heard about a new Christmas store,''
she says. ``I know it's still summer, but I love Christmas and, for
me, it's never too early to buy ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From downtown, take I-75 north to I-575. Follow
it to Ga. 515/5, then take Ga. 52 into Ellijay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Many stores are open daily from 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free parking on the square and on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are accessible.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Gilmer County Chamber of Commerce, 706-635-7400.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Just a few steps from the square, Corner Stone Cafe, 76 N.
Main St. (706-636-2233), provides a comfortable place to stop for a
lunch break. Here owners Charles and Lynn Martis offer hearty
soups, salads and sandwiches along with specialty coffee drinks.
The couple recently installed an open kitchen overlooking the
dining room's massive fieldstone fireplace. Prices range from
$2.75-$4.75. 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays; 8
a.m.-8 p.m., Fridays-Saturdays; 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   At Ruthie's Calico Cupboard, 52 N. Main St. (706-635-7575),
you'll find a casual, tidy diner serving up homemade pies along
with stick-to-your-ribs fried chicken, steak and gravy and
meatloaf. This is serious mountain food that should provide fuel
for shopping. Prices range from $1.25-$4.95. 7 a.m.-4 p.m.
Mondays-Saturdays; 11a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The apple houses: Apple season is in full bloom through
October and a few miles before you get to Ellijay, you'll pass a
slew of apple houses and orchards lining Ga. 52. From Hillcrest
Orchards to Aaron's Apple House, you'll find cider, pies, apple
breads, gifts and more than a dozen apple varieties to lug home.
Some orchards offer hayrides and a chance to pick your own apples.

<P>
   Q: I am looking for Darbo's wild blackberry preserves, which
contain blackberries as big as the tip of your thumb. I used to
find these preserves at Kroger, but not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Duren, Lawrencville (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: The Darbo family of Austria has been producing all-natural
preserves and conserves since 1879 and preparing them according to
traditional, secret Austrian recipes. It's your turn to enjoy these
preserves once again. We found your 16-ounce jar of Darbo's wild
blackberry preserves ($3.99) at the International Farmers Market,
5193 Peachtree Industrial Blvd., Chamblee (770-455-1777).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My niece is looking for sunglasses for her Australian
shepherd. While I have seen visors for dogs, I have been unable to
find sunglasses. Do you know where we might find these items?
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Chu, Snellville (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon your niece's pooch will be struting around in style. We
found these cool shades at Barking Hound Village, 1918 Cheshire
Bridge Road N.E. (404-897-3422). Made by Sunpups, the black lenses
with the colored sides are crafted from chew-resistant plastic
($6.95). They are kept in place with a sunglass holder ($5) that
fits comfortably around the dog's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since I was a small kid, a favorite soft drink of mine and my
family was Wink, produced by Canada Dry. I haven't been able to
locate it in Atlanta in over a year. I did see some in a Publix
store in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., last summer. Do you have any idea
where I might locate some in our area?
</P>
<P>
   _ Howard A. Reisman, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another Wink request: I am suffering painful withdrawal from my
favorite soft drink, diet Wink. It has disappeared from the grocery
shelves! Is it still being distributed?
</P>
<P>
   _ David P. Darden, Marietta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   And another: I am wondering about a soda called Wink, made by
Canada Dry. It was my favorite, but I haven't seen it in a long
time. Just wondering if you had any information on it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Day, Marietta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: No news is not good news about Wink, the drink that is a
combo of orange, apple and grapefruit juices. Unfortunately for
those of you who love this citrus drink, including the diet
version, it's not available in our state _ except for a few places
in South Georgia, such as Thomasville. According to Jim Hahn,
director of marketing for Southeast Atlantic Beverage, Wink, which
was owned by Canada Dry, was sold all over the country for many
years. As companies merged, Canada Dry became a part of Dr.
Pepper-7-Up and ultimately Cadbury Beverages. ``And,'' Hahn said,
``since Cadbury already owned Squirt, a similar soft drink to Wink,
the company put their marketing efforts behind Squirt because it
was better known nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as purists know, Squirt is sweeter than Wink. You can
still find Wink in certain pockets of Florida, Virginia and New
York. We found our 1-liter bottle for $1.09 at a Food Lion in
Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a perfume called ``Caesars Woman.'' It used
to be sold at Macy's, but they no longer carry it, and now I can't
find it anywhere. Help!
</P>
<P>
   _ Jill Jurkovich, Duluth
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck. We stumbled onto your fragrance in Las Vegas.
Marketed through Caesars World Merchandising, Caesars Woman made
its debut in 1988, a white floral rich in rose, Egyptian jasmine,
orange flower, geranium and iris. It's set against a backdrop of
Tibetan musk, patchouli and sandalwood. Today, the scent is only
available through the company's Web site at www.shopcaesars.com or
by calling 1-800-843-1043. A 3.3-ounce cologne spray is $49.50; a
3.3-ounce eau de parfum is $55. There's a body-and-bath collection
available as well. Incidentally, Caesars Palace, the casino resort,
also markets Caesars Man, which is a combo of lavender, citrus
notes, oakmoss, sandalwood and fir balasm. A 4-ounce cologne spray
is $39.50; a 4-ounce after shave is $29.50. You can find it at the
same locations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you tell me where I can find Murphy Oil Soap in a spray
bottle? I have not been able to find it in the past year. A note on
the original Murphy Oil Soap bottle says it can't be used as a
refill in a spray bottle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jackie Pyle, Hampton
</P>
<P>
   A: For almost 100 years, Murphy Oil Soap has been cleaning the
wood floors in American homes. In 1905, a German immigrant came to
Ohio business man Jeremiah T. Murphy with a vegetable oil soap he
claimed was easy to make and was a popular cleanser in Germany.
Murphy bought the recipe and started marketing the soap, which was
originally a paste packed in a barrel. Shoppers would scoop out
their own orders. Eventually, the soap was prepacked in cans and
later in liquid form.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cleaning wood floors and furniture, the soap can
be used in the kitchen and bathroom. And in the laundry room, use
it as a pre-spotter. We found the Murphy Oil Soap in a 22-ounce
spray bottle ($1.99) at Drug Emporium, 2953 N. Druid Hills Road
N.E. (404-636-6108). A 16-ounce bottle of the original formula soap
($1.69) is at Publix, 1544 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-898-1850). And
the 32-ounce Murphy Oil Wood Floor container ($3.89) is at Kmart,
2581 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-261-6900).

FROM NOTES ON THE SCREEN TO MUSIC IN THE EAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a strain of Romanticism that regards children as
innocent and wonderfully intuitive creatures who are strapped to
the grim wheel of the education system and ground to dust.
</P>
<P>
   As Romantic myths go, this one is almost completely false,
except perhaps in the case of music education. As many piano
teachers can tell you, children are full of music. They sing to
themselves constantly, they dance whenever your back is turned and
can clap back almost any rhythm they hear with surprising ease.
Then the piano lessons start and pretty much put an end to all
that.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame for the sorry state of music education? For one
thing, it has never benefited from the kind of advancements that,
by comparison, have improved primary reading. In the 1930s, Zerna
Sharp studied how children talked and used the same repetitive
patterns in ``Fun With Dick and Jane.'' Dr. Seuss added rhythm and
rhyme. In the late 1960s, ``Sesame Street'' offered contemporary
characters.
</P>
<P>
   But piano teachers still put 5-year-olds in front of a 600-pound
piano and tell them to find middle C.
</P>
<P>
   The real culprit is far larger and more diffuse. Music, or at
least, creating music, doesn't hold a central place in our culture
anymore. ``Serious music'' is now taken seriously only by a very
narrow slice of people, and the prevalence of recorded music has
rendered music's old social role in the home obsolete. It is
possible to envision the day, if it has not already arrived, when
more children will have downloaded an MP3 file than can play an
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great promises of multimedia was that it would
revolutionize music training by helping students understand the
correlation between the notes on the staff and the sounds in their
ears. Music Ace 2, a new program from Harmonic Vision, is an
introduction to rhythm, melody and basic harmony that takes
children aged 8 and up away from their pianos and puts them in
front of their monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The program breaks theory down into 24 lessons, from note values
and key signatures to intervals and scales. Each lesson involves a
lesson followed by a game, although game is a gentle word: They are
really exercises in ear training and rhythm that are more useful
than what typically passes for entertainment on children's
software.
</P>
<P>
   And the games are not the only case in which the program's
juvenile packaging is at odds with its serious purpose. Music Ace 2
has all the anthropomorphic touches you might expect _ the
instruments have eyes and the quarter notes wear little grins _ but
the version of music it presents comes straight out of 19th-century
Vienna. The selections tend to be marches and voluntaries that
begin with Bach and end with Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   The musical guide, Maestro Max, looks like Arthur Fiedler from
the Boston Pops and sounds like Colonel Klink from ``Hogan's
Heroes.'' ``Haydn vould be proud,'' he says, with a rolling
Prussian ``r'' after the student successfully completes a
composition exercise.
</P>
<P>
   What works, and works well, on Music Ace 2 is the screen. The
notes are fat and easy to manipulate across well-drawn staffs. The
exercises are short but well presented, even if I did find the
bouncing-ball metronome a trifle distracting.
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't work is the sound. Like almost all music programs,
Music Ace 2 relies on the MIDI files in your computer, which means
that the Bach Invention sounds less like a harpsichord and more
like the Wurlizter organ outlet at the mall. But does the sound
quality really matter in a program that's designed, after all, to
teach only music fundamentals?
</P>
<P>
   It does. What is really fundamental about music is making it.
Like too many theory lessons, Music Ace 2 becomes an excuse to put
away the musical instruments before the student really learns to
derive pleasure from playing. Give a student a piano or a drum and
she will bang away until she gets tired or until she learns to make
music. After 20 minutes of clicking my mouse in time to the
bouncing ball on Music Ace 2, all I had was a sore wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The people at GVOX have been trying to put together software
education and practical musical training for some time. Their
latest product, Ricky Recorder, tries to teach the recorder to
children with the help of a CD-ROM and a clever little microphone
that attaches to the instrument and plugs into your computer's
sound card, allowing the program to ``hear'' what you are playing
and offer lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is, Why the recorder? For those who were
forced to learn ``El Condor Pasa'' by Simon and Garfunkel (``I'd
rather be a hammer than a nail ...'') in grade school music class,
the instrument's breathy sound can be particularly traumatic. But
it's cheap: GVOX even throws in a Yamaha recorder with the
software.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? My microphone's operation was spotty at best. But
GVOX's idea is a good one for people who, for whatever reason,
can't find the time or money for formal lessons. But even if the
technology is seamless, the content on the CD-ROM isn't. The main
page of the program has four icons: a robin, a blue cloud with the
letters ``www'' written on it (for a connection to the GVOX Web
site, it turns out), a soggy-looking notebook and something that
looked like a sundial that threatened to shut down whatever I was
doing when I clicked on it.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons (found in the notebook, I discovered) show the basic
fingerings for the recorder with ghostly, hard-to-read hands and
throw in a healthy dose of theory, almost as much you find in the
more careful Music Ace 2. Whether many beginning players are
willing to wade through the lesson on dotted notes just to play the
first four bars of ``Hot Cross Buns'' is doubtful. After an hour
spent with Ricky Recorder, I had a change of heart. I really would
rather be a hammer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONOPAH, Ariz. _ From the highway, it is six miles to Brenda
Black's house, along a dusty road through boulders and saguaro
cactus. For the first four miles, a power line parallels the road.
But then the necklace of wooden poles and black cables _ the
reassuring accompaniment to millions of miles of American highways
_ ends. The house is still 1,000 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as a visitor discovered after pulling up next to the
Honda and the Chevy Blazer in Ms. Black's driveway, she is not
lacking for appliances. One of four television sets was on; so was
the ``movie star lighting'' over the bathroom sink. The kitchen
boasted not only a microwave oven, but also an electric grill.
Indeed, Ms. Black's house near Tonopah, some 60 miles west of
Phoenix, is typically American, which means it is jammed with
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, it is becoming easy for ordinary families to live
``off the grid'' _ that is, without a hookup to electric lines _
and not sacrifice comfort. For $270 a month (about $1 a kilowatt
hour), Arizona Public Service will install a backyard unit
consisting of solar panels that produce enough power for most
domestic uses, a generator that kicks in automatically when there
isn't enough sun and a propane tank to fuel the generator. The
company guarantees the equipment, promising that it will to keep
power flowing around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had them out here in the middle of the night,'' Ms. Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   A result? ``It's solar power for the fast-food generation,''
said Katy Hundelt, an off-grid customer outside Sedona. ``If we
didn't tell you, you'd come in the house and never know we had
solar,'' she said. ``We have everything everyone else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, living off the grid, an option that was once available
only to the rich or the intrepid, is going mainstream, at least in
this sunniest corner of the country. Arizona Public Service has yet
to advertise the program. Even so, Pete Johnston, the company's
manager for technology development, said, ``It's taking off.''
There are now 30 families hooked up, he said, and ``we're adding at
least one a month.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, solar systems have been available for decades. Dan
Reicher, the assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency
and renewable energy, said, ``A surprising number of companies
make, supply and even finance solar systems,'' although he added
that the majority of such systems augment company-provided power.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Public Service has big hopes for its off-grid program.
``There are a lot of people moving from California to Arizona,
people with a fair amount of money,'' Johnston said. ``They want to
build on dramatic sites. And until now, their only options were
propane generators or do-it-yourself solar.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers who developed the no-fuss system see themselves as
environmentalists. And in trying to limit reliance on fossil fuels,
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the program may prove to have an environmental downside, as
new homes, untethered to power lines, begin turning up in some of
the state's most pristine locations. Ms. Hundelt's house occupies
just such a spot. ``We've got a whole mountain for a backdrop,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vern Swaback, a Scottsdale architect responsible for some of the
largest suburban developments in Arizona, said that everyone there
has had the experience of discovering that a favorite mountaintop
or butte is suddenly dotted with buildings. ``Too often,'' he said,
``people are under the illusion that what they're looking at is
preserved open space, when it's just land that people haven't
gotten around to using.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Verner, an off-grid customer outside Prescott, in northern
Arizona, worries that ``the open land may get chopped up.''
</P>
<P>
   William Riebsame, a professor at the University of Colorado who
studies land-use patterns in the West, said the '90s have seen an
explosion of home building in remote areas, where obtaining
electricity is often a challenge. In Arizona, hooking up can cost
$50,000 and more _ sometimes much more _ for each mile off the
grid. Most off-grid customers, said Herb Hayden, the program's
coordinator, are more than half a mile from the nearest power line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence from the grid, with reliable power for everything
from family entertainment centers to pool and spa pumps, would be a
further enabling force for even more rural and near-wilderness
development,'' Riebsame said.
</P>
<P>
   Reicher, the assistant secretary of energy, disagreed, noting
that for most people, the cost of building roads and bringing in
water are even more daunting. ``I don't see solar as a big factor
in where people decide to build,'' he said. Moreover, he noted that
state and local laws on land development were the traditional way
to control land use.
</P>
<P>
   In Bisbee, a small mining town in the southeast part of the
state, a California company is turning a canyon lined with cholla,
agave, cottonwood, yucca and pinyon into a development called
Bisbee Ranch. The land, which has been described as ``national park
quality,'' had not been developed, in part because bringing in
electricity was prohibitively expensive. That was before Arizona
Public Service made a deal with the developer to provide the
off-grid system to those who will buy the 60 40-acre plots.
</P>
<P>
   The other utility _ telephone service _ ceased being a stumbling
block when cellular technology came in. (Even in cell-less areas,
radiotelephones work fine, as the reporter interviewing homeowners
for this article found out.) Wireless Internet connections will be
next.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the developer of Bisbee Ranch, Joe Pinsonneault, said
of the off-grid system: ``This seems to be the ticket to the
future. It's really the millennium system.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not be far off. It has been about a century since
electrification came to America, with the resulting patterns of
habitation, where even rural houses were built in proximity to the
grid. Now, the off-grid system, at least in the Sun Belt, could
result in a new development model.
</P>

   The technology the off-grid customers are using isn't especially
new. Photovoltaic panels capable of powering a house (at least in
the Southwest) have been around for decades. Prices have been
dropping steadily. Assistant Secretary Reicher said that in 1980,
the cost of producing a kilowatt hour with photovoltaic cells was
about $1; now it's down to about 15 or 20 cents in some cases.
(That compares to an average cost of about 9 cents a kilowatt hour
for power from the local utility.) ``It's a wonderful technology,''
he said, ``with no moving parts.''

   Until now, a family hoping to rely on solar power had to do its
homework. The Real Goods Trading Co., a leading purveyor of
residential solar generators, markets systems similar to those
offered by Arizona Public Service. But they start at $5,000, and
$17,000 is about the lowest price for a unit that will handle
``problem loads'' like a laser printer or an adjustable-speed
ceiling fan, the company says. Plus, as Real Goods warns in its
Internet catalog, its kits ``require substantial time, expertise
and small parts to install on site.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the off-grid system is more expensive than a
conventional hook-up (the average residential electric bill in
Arizona is $92 a month), but it's much less expensive than bringing
in a power line. Other options _ including wind turbines and
hydrogen-powered fuel cells _ are not yet economical enough for
residential use, said Doug Livingston, the technical products
merchandise manager for Real Goods.
</P>
<P>
   Generators are more affordable, but they tend to be problematic.
Ms. Verner, the off-grid customer near Prescott, made do with a
diesel generator on her family's cattle ranch for almost 20 years.
The equipment was smelly and expensive, she said, and the power
wasn't steady enough for a computer. Now, her teen-age children
have no problem doing their homework on the family's PC.
</P>
<P>
   And in the old days, she said, ``I had to wait till nighttime to
do wash'' when there were fewer demands for power. ``Now,'' she
added, ``from about 10 till 3, I have electricity coming out of my
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Public Service's off-grid customers generally do not
have air-conditioners, but they do have energy-efficient
evaporative coolers. Otherwise, normal appliances are OK. The
company recommends using mainly fluorescent lights. Ms. Black has
noticed that if she leaves the microwave on too long, the back-up
generator kicks in, consuming propane. So if she has to cook for
six minutes, she may do it in three two-minute stretches.
</P>
<P>
   But that's her biggest problem with the off-grid system, which
is why Ms. Black is the envy of neighbors who haven't yet signed
up. ``Some of the other people who live out here, they've just got
generators,'' she said. ``And when the generator breaks, they've
got nothing.''

ALTERNATIVES TO BASIC MICE

<P>
   Q. My parents, in their late 60s, are beginning to use a
computer. They are having a hard time working the mouse; to
compound the problem, my father is left-handed and my mother
right-handed. Is there a good alternative to the standard PC mouse?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of different kinds of mice and other
pointing devices available, so it's just a matter of finding
something that your parents feel more comfortable with. For any new
computer user, regardless of age, using the mouse effectively often
requires a bit of practice to learn the necessary motor
coordination and skill.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to slow down the speed of the mouse's movement and
clicking while your parents are learning. Go to the Start menu,
then Settings and Control Panel, then Mouse. There, you can also
change the default settings for a left-handed or a right-handed
user with one click.
</P>
<P>
   For alternatives to the standard PC equipment, check out options
from mouse makers like Logitech (www.logitech.com) and Kensington
(www.kensington.com). Logitech makes a cordless mouse that can be
moved from one side of the keyboard to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Some users find trackballs or computer pens and tablets easier
to manipulate than a mouse, and Kensington makes a number of
trackballs with large programmable buttons.

   Compaq Joins Battle For Pocket-Size Market
</P>
<P>
   While Handspring and Palm Computing slugged it out last week,
Compaq this week unveiled a new contender in the pocket-size
category: a Windows CE device that scraps the showy color screen in
favor of a slimmer design.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from the Palm V, Compaq's Aero 1530 is the
skinniest CE personal digital assistant yet. It is a half-inch
thick and sells for $299. Although that is $150 less than the Palm
V, the Aero 1530 still holds things like contact, schedule, task
and e-mail information.

   Licensing Issue Stirs Up A Debate Over Using GIFs
</P>
<P>
   Web developers, faced with the prospect of paying $5,000 for
using an image-file format that has become a building block of the
Web, are taking their anger public.
</P>
<P>
   The tiff is over GIFs. Most people who create Web pages are
familiar with GIFs _ the slang term for digital images that carry
the ``.gif'' extension and have been compressed using the Graphics
Interchange Format. But most people are probably not aware that the
programming code behind the GIF format is patented and belongs to
Unisys, the computer company based in Blue Bell, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Unisys quietly posted the new policy on its Web
site. It requires any Web developers using GIF who do not have a
GIF license to get one for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-known imaging products, like Corel Draw or Adobe
Photoshop, already come with Unisys licenses. But that is not the
case for the vast majority of imaging software that can be
downloaded free. Even people who simply use GIFs by copying images
from other Web sites could be liable under the policy unless they
can prove that the images were originally created using licensed
software.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, several developers caught wind of the policy,
and angry messages streamed into Unisys and into techie-oriented
Web sites like Slashdot.org and Linuxworld.
</P>
<P>
   To many Internet denizens, the concept of patenting pieces of
computer code is equivalent to patenting mathematical equations.
They believe that such codes should be freely available.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Picher, a spokesman for Unisys, said the company had no
plans to go after people who have simply copied images and pasted
them into their sites (although, he noted, copyright holders might
have their own problem with that.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not actually going out and tracking people down,''
Picher said. But he added that if developers created a popular Web
site ``with valuation in the billions, they might expect a phone
call from us.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Need to Start the Wash? It's Just a Phone Call Away
</P>
<P>
   A certain long-distance communications company lets you ``reach
out and touch someone,'' but the World Wireless Communications
company is promising to let you reach out and control parts of your
house through the World Wide Web. ``The garage door on your home
could be controlled by the browser on your desk at work,'' said
Donald I. Wallace, the president of X-tra Web (www.x-traweb.com),
the division of the company introducing the technology.
</P>
<P>
   The X-tra Web system works by attaching a tiny microcontroller
called an X-Node to an appliance or machine. The X-Node then
transmits data to an X-Gate, an Internet gateway, that then can be
monitored from the Internet with a standard Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Node itself has a little Web page in it, so we're
actually giving the washing machine or the garage door its own
little mini Web page,'' Wallace explained. ``It has its own IP
address, just the same as any other Web page does. So all you have
to do is open your browser, type in the IP address of your garage
door and you would get back the status of the garage door.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to allow control or observation of things
like automated teller machines, home appliances, office equipment,
medical monitors and security systems over the Web. The X-tra Web
technology is already being tested or used by a number of
businesses, including a vending-machine company, a fast-food
franchise and an engineering firm, but the company also has an eye
on the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are inexpensive, about $25 per X-Node and $150 for
the gateway, and the company expects to see Web-enabled homes by
early next year. And hey, it may just get the kids interested in
housework _ just make sure little Tommy doesn't crash the dryer.

   Works Suite 2000 Weighs In As a Hefty Microsoft Upgrade
</P>
<P>
   With the accordianlike expansion of hard drive space on new
personal computers, software developers appear increasingly
comfortable offering consumers more huge programs that fill them
up.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Microsoft released Works Suite 2000, an integrated
collection of utility and reference applications that is a kind of
office suite for the home computer user. The program is at least
400 percent larger than Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in between 785 megabytes and 1.4 gigabytes (depending
on installed features), Works Suite 2000 promises to help users do
everything from home publishing, organizing their lives, managing
finances, planning trips, editing photographs and doing research in
an included digital encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is a complete solution for home users,'' said
Hillarie Flood, the product manager for Works Suite 2000. ``When
you look at the types of things that people do in their homes and
compare them with what we ship, there is really a good match
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Works Suite 2000, which includes Microsoft's Word 2000, Money
2000 Standard, Home Publishing 2000, Expedia Streets and Trips
2000, and an express version of Picture It, costs $109, which makes
it a lot cheaper than its corporate cousin. It is an upgrade
product, which means that it requires at least a copy of Word
Perfect or Word on a computer before it can be installed. &QL;

   A Program That Lets You Talk Your Way Around
</P>
<P>
   Don't be alarmed if you find someone muttering ``whisky, whisky,
whisky'' at their computer. They may be using Conversa Web, which
allows users to run Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser with
their voices rather than their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of clicking on Web page links, Conversa Web users simply
read them out loud. For graphics that provide links, the program
generates miniature cartoon bubbles containing a number that is
read aloud to make the link _ the company calls them ``saycons.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple spoken phrases like ``go back'' operate the browser's
navigation commands. Conversa Web can be used only to operate the
browser, not for dictation.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the idiosyncratic spellings frequently used in
Web addresses (say, ``kwik'' for quick'') make it impossible to
enter them with normal speech. Instead users must spell them out
using the military-style oral alphabet (``whisky'' for ``w,'' for
example).
</P>
<P>
   Web addresses, after they have been entered orally or by typing
them in, can be put on an oral favorites list and called up with a
word of the user's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Conversa Web 3.0 costs $59.95. It only works on Windows-based
PCs with versions 4 or 5 of Internet Explorer.

BUSH EXPECTED TO CALL FOR MORE MILITARY SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush will use the Citadel in
Charleston, S.C., Thursday as a backdrop to renew his call to
``rebuild the military power'' of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and other Republican presidential candidates have accused
the Clinton administration of weakening the military.
</P>
<P>
   In his second major policy speech, Bush is expected to tell
cadets at the Citadel, a private military college, that the United
States needs to improve housing for armed forces personnel and
increase pay and training. He also seeks a new system of
intermediate range, anti-ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a dangerous world. There are madmen, terrorists
and missiles,'' Bush said in New Hampshire earlier this month where
he gave businessmen a taste of what he is expected to say on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will rebuild the military power of the United States of
America,'' he said in Hew Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at the Citadel will detail his vision for the
military, said Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, who served as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff under the governor's father, President George
Bush, reviewed the speech that was written by Bush and his policy
advisers, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those advisers, Condoleezza Rice and Bob Zoellick, also
worked in the Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has vowed ``never, ever'' to commit U.S. forces
to United Nations control _ a line that resonates with Republicans
critical of the Clinton administration's handling of peacekeeping
efforts abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a defense strategy expert at the non-partisan
Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, was critical
of Bush's earlier remarks on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``His defense rhetoric is not that notable, because it is
essentially repeating conventional wisdom,'' O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other Republican presidential hopefuls also have
charged that the U.S. military has deteriorated under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a prisoner of War during the
Vietnam war, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah have accused the
administration of allowing military equipment and weapons to age,
while troops have been overextended in peacekeeping missions around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the Democratic nomination
to succeed Clinton, has called for quality-of-life initiatives to
boost morale, such as increased pay, better housing and better
training.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to sign defense legislation this year that
would give members of the armed services a 4.8 percent pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, while endorsing the pay increase, also is seeking a boost
in benefits for the nation's veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we do for our veterans after the battle will matter if
we don't back them up while they're in the trenches and on the
front lines, fighting for us,'' Gore told the 81st annual American
Legion National Convention in Anaheim, Calif., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush postponed his defense speech last week when Hurricane Floyd
threatened the East Coast, and rescheduled it at the Citadel. South
Carolina is an early primary state that could be key to earning the
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is going to be talking about is the future of the
military. And who better to give the speech to than the future of
the military?'' Tucker said.

   Also Thursday, Texas first lady Laura Bush is scheduled to be in
San Antonio to address the Texas Association of Broadcasters on
early childhood reading initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   She will then attend a fund-raiser with San Antonio businessmen
that is expected to raise $125,000 for her husband's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised $52 million, becoming the first presidential
hopeful to pass the $50 million barrier. President Clinton and
Republican nominee Bob Dole raised roughly $45 million each in
1996, amounts that eclipsed earlier campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has said he will not accept federal matching
funds, a move that will allow him to spend as much as he can raise
before the GOP primaries next year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes also has agreed not
to accept matching funds from the government.

`WEST WING': A POWERFUL WORKPLACE DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in ``The West Wing,'' the camera follows Chief of Staff
Leo McGarry like a lovesick lap dog, zooming down long corridors
and short hallways, zipping around sharp corners, popping in and
out of offices, slipping in and out of doorways, maneuvering,
navigating, weaving and dodging personnel moving at the same speed
but in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, McGarry (John Spencer) is talking to everyone and
everyone is talking to McGarry, and the pace is so frantic and
maddening and chaotic that you wonder: How could government work so
much in sync yet achieve so little?
</P>
<P>
   The Aaron Sorkin drama is like that. It's the workplace that
never rests, or sleeps, or shuts up. ``Sports Night,'' which Sorkin
created and writes, often goes at the same
get-out-of-the-blocks-fast pace, offers the same witty, rapid-fire
dialogue, and presents the same kind of characters, so committed
that they need to be committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear talk like that in this office,'' the
president's secretary barks to McGarry, who, while sprinting
through the Oval Office, has just called the commander in chief a
``geek'' for riding his bike into a large tree and injuring an
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   In concept, ``The West Wing'' _ one of the most widely discussed
series of the new TV season because of its pedigree, its political
subject matter and co-star Rob Lowe _ owes its existence to ``The
American President,'' the sentimental feature film that Sorkin also
penned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' is what ``The American President'' would have
been had it focused less on Michael Douglas as the prez and more on
bouncy speech writer Michael J. Fox and his crew of image makers.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they are represented by a fine batch of actors, but we'll
get to them later. First, Lowe, the self-proclaimed ``political
junkie'' whose only connection to politics is voting and that
three-way tryst videotaped while he attended the 1988 Democratic
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe plays deputy communications director and beleaguered speech
writer Sam Seaborn. We first meet him in a bar trying to avoid a
reporter and get the attention of a woman eyeing him from across
the way. Yeah. Sex still follows this guy like a bad penny.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward. Lowe is gathering his clothes from the woman's
apartment. A few moments later, he learns that she's a law student
and part-time bartender and call girl.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Sam is having a rough day, consider Deputy Chief of
Staff Josh Lyman, played by Bradley Whitford. He has mouthed off to
an extremist leader from the Christian right on a TV news show and
could be fired. We don't learn his fate until the episode's end,
when the president (Martin Sheen) hobbles in to address the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Josh is also a former beau of political consultant
Madeline Hampton (Moira Kelly), the new troubleshooter now working
for _ and sleeping with _ the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schiff is the hustling Toby Ziegler, a gruff
communications head whom we meet on an airplane, as he is
condescending to a flight attendant who orders him to shut down his
laptop and cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' kicks off as all the staff members get beeped
about the president's terrible bicycling skills. C.J. Gregg
(Allison Janney) gets her message while on a treadmill, trying to
hit on the sweaty cutie one treadmill over. That she ends up flying
off the thing while trying to check the beeper is a hit-and-run
demonstration that a single professional woman just can't get a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen rounds out what I think is the most gifted cast of the new
television season. His president is a folksy populist, a shrewd
political strategist who is blunt and honest. He seems to have a
thing for spewing lengthy anecdotes while everyone around him
patiently listens.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope he keeps this to a minimum. This is the same
speechifying we get from ``Sports Night'' _ as if a cable sports
program is saving the world from evil.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at least, Sorkin can set up those kinds of scenarios:
Problems on Thursday's episode involve Cubans trying to defect to
the United States on tiny rafts, and that visit by a group of
radical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' pilot is as sleek as television gets, a
well-written, well-executed piece of work that looks even better
because it doesn't look like most of the shows we consume.
</P>
<P>
   I can't detect any problems so far, unless the politically
active Sheen has a bone to pick with a Sorkin script and shuts down
the set with a sit-in.
</P>
<P>
   But I figure Sorkin would merely find a way to write that into
the script as well.

INSTANT MESSAGES, POPULAR AT HOME, PROVE TO BE A MIXED BLESSING AT
WORK 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately, Virginia Shea has started to sneak around on line.
Instant messages, she said, have left her no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I log on to try to work, then see that somebody on my
instant-message contact list is on, too, I log off right away _
without even reading my e-mail,'' said Ms. Shea, a writer who works
from her home in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``I just know they are going to
send me a message to say hi or something. I often just don't have
time to say hi.''
</P>
<P>
   Her other option would be to stay on line without replying.
``But that would be totally rude, wouldn't it?'' Ms. Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   She has to ask? Ms. Shea is the author of a 1994 book called
``Netiquette'' (Albion Books). If she doesn't know how to deal with
instant messages in the workplace, it raises the question, Who
does?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: nobody, apparently. Instant message programs,
which allow computer users to carry on quick on-screen
conversations with one another, started as a home hobby, enabling
chatty teen-agers to keep in touch without big phone bills. The
popularity of the two most widely used programs, ICQ and America
Online's Instant Messenger, has shot up, with the number of home
users leaping from a mere 500,000 in early 1997 to more than 25.1
million at the end of June, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before home computer users
started to install instant-message software on their office
computers and create informal networks of conversing colleagues.The
business market is big enough and lucrative enough that Microsoft
and Yahoo spent part of the summer in a spat with AOL because they
want to link their instant-message systems to AOL's so that
messages can easily flow from one system to the others.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike e-mail messages, which wait patiently for you to open
them, an instant message is the electronic equivalent of a ringing
phone because it pops up on the recipient's screen right away.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody apparently forgot to ask instant-message users what
they thought. Many of the features that make the service so
appealing to teen-agers _its speed, intrusiveness and the ability
to see who else is on line _ has made it as welcome as a Friday
afternoon meeting in many offices.
</P>
<P>
   Messages that pop up on screen at an inopportune moment
(sometimes from the next cubicle) are destroying workers'
concentration. Thoughtless text scrawled and sent in haste can
spark online arguments. And in some offices, the question of who is
privileged enough to receive certain instant messages is creating
the kind of tortured pecking order last seen in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Razvan Surdulescu, a software developer at Trilogy Software in
Austin, Texas, started using instant messages several months ago to
chat with friends in and out of work. But he started to be
frequently interrupted by personal messages just when he was about
to go to important meetings. ``It got out of control in April,'' he
said, ``because I have a lot of friends who weren't working and had
a lot of time on their hands. Every day at around 5 p.m., they'd
ask if I wanted to have a chat, at the worst time of day. So I had
to set the controls to make myself invisible to most people. I
started lurking, in the sense that I was only available to
co-workers who really needed to reach me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages can be more annoying than other forms of
electronic communication because they appear on screen as soon as
they are sent. Recipients of voice mail, e-mail or faxes can choose
to acknowledge a message whenever it is convenient. But with
instant messages, the sender is in control, unless the recipient
dodges messages electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you can turn off the ringer on your phone, you can turn
off your instant messages, keeping everyone, or just certain
people, from getting through. But just as with a phone that is
never answered, people will wonder why you are not available for
instant messages. Another strategy is to tell your computer to
respond to instant messages by sending a message saying you will be
back later, but that can also irritate people trying to reach you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cyber-equivalent of someone walking into your office
and starting up a conversation as if you had nothing better to
do,'' said Jeanne Hinds, who publishes a Web page called Etiquette
Hell and is the co-moderator of a an e-mail group that discusses
general etiquette. ``It violates the basic courtesy of not shoving
yourself into other people's faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hinds, whose Web page (www.thinds.com/jmh/ehell) chronicles
lapses in politeness no matter where they may occur, said that
instant messages violated the American sense of private space.
``Even in the office, we think of our personal space as being a
five-foot radius around ourselves,'' she said. ``Instant messages
come blaring into the space, and it's an invasion.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Another troublesome feature of instant message programs are
Buddy Lists or other contact lists. ``It's a very cliquish thing,''
said a worker at an Internet start-up venture in New York City who
asked not to be identified because she feared losing her job if her
employer found out that she was chatting with friends through
instant messages. ``You know you're in the `in' crowd if you get on
the right contact list and start hearing all the office gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages can turn your co-workers into Big Brother. When
you use an instant message program, your list of contacts pops up
on screen and lets you know whether a co-worker on the list is
logged on. ``Usually on Fridays, people stay home to work instead
of coming into the office, but if you call up your contact list,
you see that a lot of those people are not actually on line,'' the
worker at the Internet startup said. ``I noticed this happens more
frequently on beautiful sunny days, by the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Already overburdened by an avalanche of electronic
communications _ the typical corporate employee sends and gets 201
messages a day and may be interrupted as often as every 10 minutes,
according to a study released this year by Pitney Bowes _ many
workers say they cannot handle any more. So they are going to great
lengths to hide out from a form of electronic communication that
should, in theory, make their jobs easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have a new communications medium, it takes some
time to learn to use it politely,'' said Robert Bacal, an
independent communications consultant who specializes in defusing
hostile situations in the workplace. ``It took years, for instance,
for telephone etiquette to become ingrained in people's minds.''
Bacal, by the way, refuses to use instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   Many new users may not understand how to address people politely
using instant messages. ``If you watch a little child try to use
the phone, just sitting there in silence or else talking to the
family dog instead of the person on the phone,'' he said, ``you get
an idea of how some people are behaving with instant messages in
the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages were not nearly so intrusive before they moved
into the cubicle. ``Instant messages are what we call a viral
thing, something that started coming into the workplace on its
own,'' said Michael Sheridan, a vice president for strategy at
Novell, which added an instant-message feature to its Groupwise
network software product more than a year ago. ``You frequently
can't control a social phenomenon like this, so you kind of have to
not fight it. But it's time for the company to embrace it so there
can be appropriate controls.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, sending instant messages can take up a
significant portion of the workday. A manager at a Fortune 500
communications company who asked not to be identified because she
was worried about her employer's reaction to her instant-message
chats said that she had used AOL Instant Messenger earlier this
year to carry on numerous personal conversations every week with a
co-worker in another department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would discuss who she was dating, what would be appropriate
first-date behavior, where to shop for clothes, that sort of
thing,'' the manager said. ``But it got out of hand in June, when
there was a birthday party luncheon for one employee and certain
people were invited, but my friend was excluded. This is a very
politically charged office, and she became obsessed with sending me
instant messages asking, `How did this happen?' I told her I was
too busy to talk, but she kept sending them and took up so much of
my time that I had to skip lunch _ I ended up missing the birthday
party myself. I was furious, and I lost my temper.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few days, the manager said, she used a different
screen name so her acquaintance would not know how to reach her on
line. ``We recovered eventually, but decided to keep the chitchat
to a minimum in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minimum, it turns out. In August, the manager's
company put an end to instant messages. ``Our company could see the
activity on everyone's terminal and apparently noticed a lot of
people were using instant-message software,'' the manager said.
``So they just stopped our ability to use any Internet-based
instant-message program. I guess it's back to e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, instant messages can be a useful communications tool
for colleagues who may be geographically remote but must still work
closely. ``We have one customer with offices in both North America
and in South America who reduced their yearly long-distance phone
bill by $28,000 because of instant messaging,'' said Lee Todd, the
senior director for the Lotus Sametime instant-message and
instant-meeting product. ``Instead of calling South America and
leaving voice mail 10 times a day, which you have to pay for each
time, they used instant messages to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   All three leading makers of network software _ Novell, Lotus and
Microsoft _ have incorporated features into their instant-message
programs to allow users to decide who can reach them and when. A
person can arrange to have electronic notes, which bring to mind
stick-on paper notes, sent out in response to instant messages to
signal that the person is away from the desk or in a meeting until
4 p.m. (or just generally hiding out). But it can be hard to hide
out if the person who is sending you a message is sitting in the
same office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or you could just turn it off,'' said Surdulescu, of Trilogy
Software. ``But I guess that kind of defeats the point.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The first day of autumn will bring a warming trend to the
Northeast. A freshening wind from the southwest will direct
unseasonably warm air from the middle of the nation toward the
Atlantic Seaboard. Sunshine will prevail near the coast, but
patches of clouds will arrive across the interior Northeast. An
elongated high-pressure system, stretching from the Carolinas to
Texas will promote bright and dry conditions over most of the
South. After a very cool morning in the northern Gulf states,
readings will rise to seasonal levels by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and patches of showers will cover Florida as a front
remains over southern sections. The return flow of humid air around
high pressure over Texas will draw moisture into the Rio Grande
Valley. A weak disturbance over the southern Rockies will be
infused with the moistened air leading to more widespread clouds
and afternoon thundershowers from New Mexico to Nevada. Low
pressure aloft off the California coast will invite some clouds and
showers into central sections of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of slightly cooler air into the upper Great Lakes will
be preceded by gusty winds and scattered showers. The cold front
marking the edge of the new cool air mass will push across the
Midwest with increasing clouds, but most sections will stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will dominate the interior West with sunshine in
the northern Rockies and inland Northwest. A cold front approaching
western Washington will cause clouds and onshore winds. Northern
California will be brighter, though afternoon showers should
develop over the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn Begins
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of fall at precisely 7:31 p.m. EDT Thursday means
little meteorologically. During the next several weeks, however, as
solar rays become less direct in the Northern Hemisphere, the
weather will surely respond. The sun does not heat the atmosphere
directly since the envelope of air is mainly transparent to its
high-energy radiation. The earth absorbs much of the sun's energy.
Lower energy radiation from the ground then heats the atmosphere
from below. In the weeks ahead, the diminishing solar energy at the
ground will lead inevitably to a chilling of the atmosphere above.

GARTH BROOKS PLAYS THE ROCKER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a music critic, the truest measure of an album's worth often
comes after the review. While writing about a record, one is
required to listen to it over and over until each song is etched
into memory.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, be the review positive or negative, free will
takes over, and the best sign of an album's merit is how many times
the critic _ with hundreds of CDs arriving in the mail weekly _
listens to it again, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The R.E.M. album ``Monster,'' for example, feels over-rated in
retrospect because the desire to listen to it has disappeared,
while the Neil Young album ``Ragged Glory'' deserves all the praise
it received because it survives prominently on the listening pile.
</P>
<P>
   Already it is apparent that ``Garth Brooks in ... The Life of
Chris Gaines'' (Capitol 7243-5-20051-2-3), an apochryphal greatest
hits album recorded by the country star Brooks under the pseudonym
of the rock star Gaines, is a good album that I will probably never
listen to again.
</P>
<P>
   It is like a movie one relishes while watching but completely
forgets afterward. At best, there are a few songs _ the psychedelic
pop ballad ``Maybe,'' the more traditionally Garth ``It Don't
Matter to the Sun'' _ worth putting on mix tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, however, Brooks deserves a pat on the hat for the
undertaking. Detractors accuse him of using the pseudonym because
he is too chicken to risk failure with a rock album under his own
name. Others say it is part of Brooks' attempt to rule the
entertainment world, to sell more albums than the Beatles (the only
act that has outsold him, according to the Recording Industry
Association of America).
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks claims that the collection was released solely to
create anticipation for and familiarity with a character in a movie
he is starring in and helping to produce, ``The Lamb,'' which looks
back on the life and mysterious death of Chris Gaines, a fictitious
rock icon who found success first as a member of an '80s
one-hit-wonder band called Crush and later as a Grammy-winning solo
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The album is billed as a ``pre-soundtrack'' for the film, a
movie for which a not single frame has been shot. Brooks, who often
refers to himself in the third person as if Garth Brooks is just
another character, a middle American Everyman, has already
committed to releasing one more Gaines album, the actual soundtrack
to ``The Lamb''; if these albums are successful, he might record
the five albums that supposedly predate the greatest hits package.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is a testament to cowardice, marketing or
megalomania, ``Chris Gaines'' is a gutsy undertaking, not only as
an attempt by an outsider to fit into another genre but also as a
greatest hits album that tries to fit into each phase of that
genre's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines may be a pseudonym _ complete with an elaborate invented
background that incorporates bits of Dylan, Beatles and Prince lore
and parallels elements of Brooks' life (the solo careers of both
begin in 1989, and both have the same number of letters in their
first and last names).
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Gaines is very much Garth Brooks, who has described
himself as a melting pot of the past. Chris Gaines represents a few
of the ingredients in that pot: James Taylor, the Eagles, the
Beatles, Boston and Aerosmith (whose ``Fever'' Brooks has covered).
</P>
<P>
   The overall impression of ``Chris Gaines'' as an album with no
aftertaste is partly the result of the concept, an exercise in
image alteration, vocal manipulation and imagination. The overly
slick songs are as much bought as they are sung; they're the sound
of one man rich enough to purchase his own rock album to sing on.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Brooks manages to sound nothing like himself
about half the time, smoothing out his country crack and twang for
a pop falsetto, a driving rock rasp and a surprising amount of
rhythm-and-blues balladeering. But on songs like the cheesy
synthesizer-rocker ``Way of the Girl,'' one can hear the gulf
between the vocalist and the material, which is so empty of meaning
that it would be hard for anyone to sing it with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Likable but not spectacular, ``Chris Gaines'' is in keeping with
much of the work of its producer, Don Was, who is responsible for
many albums by rock stars that are released with great fanfare but
don't have staying power; among them are Brian Wilson's ``I Just
Wasn't Made for These Times,'' the Rolling Stones' ``Voodoo
Lounge,'' Iggy Pop's ``Brick by Brick,'' Bob Dylan's ``Under the
Red Sky'' and the ``Backbeat'' soundtrack, a not entirely
dissimilar exercise in which alternative rock musicians pretended
to be the Beatles during their Hamburg days.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Brooks combines '60s melodies with '80s production
for most of the album. He rips off Dylan's ``Knockin' on Heaven's
Door'' for the verses of ``Main Street,'' mixes deadpan rapping and
the Youngbloods' ``Get Together'' for ``Right Now,'' and
incorporates the opening of the Beatles' ``Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds'' in ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Brooks' country music, the influence of macho '80s rock is
everywhere: the photographs of fake album covers in the CD booklet
carry images of a straitjacketed Gaines flanked by nurses in garter
belts and Gaines with hands folded contemplatively over the chest
of a woman in a hot pink brassiere.
</P>
<P>
   Another major influence is Babyface, the rhythm-and-blues
songwriter, singer and producer whose song for the Tony Rich
Project, ``Nobody Knows,'' became a No. 1 country hit when it was
performed by Kevin Sharp and seems to be an inspiration for the
acoustic-guitar soul on this album.
</P>
<P>
   Babyface, in fact, is also a producer of ``The Lamb''; in
addition, the Nashville songwriting team that wrote most of the
album _ Gordon Kennedy, Wayne Kirkpatrick and Tommy Simms _ are
best known for the Eric Clapton and Babyface collaboration ``Change
the World.'' The first single of theirs from the Brooks album,
``Lost in You,'' previously appeared on an album by Ricky Jones, an
r-and-b singer who has worked with Babyface.
</P>
<P>
   But let's take Chris Gaines at face value and pretend that this
is an actual greatest hits album (recorded in reverse chronological
order with two new songs) by a Grammy-winning rocker with a career
spanning from 1986 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   What do we think of Gaines? He has spent too much of his career
being overproduced, he has let the same people write most of his
material, he seems to change a lot without actually evolving, his
voice is nice but his work lacks consistency and vision, and while
his music isn't disposable, it isn't valuable, either. In other
words, he's a good puppet in the hands of Brooks, an ambitious and
agile but limited puppeteer.

HISPANIC GROUP URGES PARENTS TO TURN OFF TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thoroughly unimpressed by the offering of new
television shows on the nation's major networks, state leaders of
the League of United Latin American Citizens on Wednesday urged
Hispanic parents to pull their children away from the tube and
focus on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic community has basically decided that we are going
to take the bull by the horns,'' said Rene Lara, a member of the
organization's Texas education committee. ``Turn off the television
and work on homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Lara and LULAC directors from across Texas said the directive is
part of a larger education plan to address problems that
disproportionately affect minorities, such as school dropout rates
and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   The effort dovetails with a nationwide ``brownout,'' or boycott,
of the major TV networks being encouraged by leaders of the
National Council of La Raza and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations have decried the lack of minority actors in
network shows and criticized the use of negative stereotypes to
portray minorities on television.
</P>
<P>
   LULAC members singled out the season premiere Tuesday night of
``Will &AMP; Grace'' as an example of a lack of sensitivity toward
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene on the NBC program, a wealthy, salty-tongued
character named Karen tells her Salvadoran maid: ``Hey, you're on
the clock, Tamale. Get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the group, only one other Hispanic _ also portrayed
as a maid _ appeared the same evening on network TV in ABC's
``Dharma and Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez, a LULAC district director from San Antonio,
said he was concerned about the potential harmful effects such
stereotypes would have on Hispanic children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are Hispanic children supposed to grow up thinking when
they are only portrayed as maids and gang members?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Chavez, LULAC district director for Central Texas, said
she participated in the brownout Tuesday and, after resisting a
compelling urge to turn on her TV, she discovered she can do better
things with her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a TV watcher. I didn't know what to do with myself,'' she
said. ``But I got busy on the computer and the Internet, and I
found that I could do a lot of constructive things.''

IF YOU TAKE PICTURES, A DIGITAL CAMERA IS PROBABLY IN YOUR FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB NORBERG   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Digital cameras are more expensive, produce
lower-quality pictures and are slightly more difficult to use than
their roll-film counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But because they are digital and the photos can move easily over
the Internet, they're the fastest-growing part of the photographic
market: 1.8 million digital cameras are expected to be sold this
year and 6.8 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to get pictures in digital format immediately,
they want to store pictures on the Internet and they want to e-mail
them,'' said Michelle Lampmann of InfoTrends Research Inc., a
Boston research firm. ``It's still going to be a few years before
they are mainstream, but sales are just starting to pick up for the
general consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras already are well-entrenched in business
applications, including real estate sales, insurance adjusting and
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all you want is to take pictures of your child's
birthday party or eighth-grade graduation, digital cameras probably
are in your future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that within my lifetime there will be more
people using digital cameras than film cameras,'' said 45-year-old
Alexis Gerard, publisher of The Future Image Report in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is that camera prices are dropping; the pictures
can be viewed immediately, then saved or deleted; and pictures can
be e-mailed to friends and relatives around the world or put on
your own Internet photo album. The cameras can be used to catalog
possessions, such as home furnishings or a stamp collection.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a digital camera, the first thing to consider is how
it will be used. A $300 digital camera will be just fine for
pictures that will be e-mailed to friends and family, while a
$1,000 camera will take high-quality pictures that can be enlarged
and printed.
</P>
<P>
   Both digital and film photography work in similar ways, taking
light in through a lens.
</P>
<P>
   In a film camera, the light falls on a rectangle of film that
has 18 million pixels, or light-sensitive specks that capture
light.
</P>
<P>
   In digital cameras, the light falls on an electronic sensor that
can have up to 2 million pixels. The more pixels, the better the
resolution. One million, or a megapixel, is considered the
threshold for satisfactory pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The camera image can be seen on a color liquid crystal display
or through an optical viewfinder, like those found on
point-and-shoot film cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the shutter button is pressed, many digital cameras save
the image on small removable cartridges of ``flash memory,'' which
typically range from 8 to 32 megabytes in size, produced by
manufacturers such as SmartCard or CompactFlash. Other cameras save
images to built-in flash memory modules, while one Sony camera uses
floppy disks that can be loaded directly into a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of pictures per megabyte depends on the resolution _
the higher the resolution, the larger the file size and the fewer
images that can fit on a memory cartridge. A 32mb cartridge will
hold 36 pictures at high resolution, 71 at normal and 181 at low
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Once the picture is taken, the photographer can bring the images
up on the LCD and delete those he doesn't want.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures are then transferred to a user's computer in a
number of ways. The camera can be attached by a cord to the
computer through a serial port; the cartridge can be put into a
card reader that is attached through a serial port; or the
cartridge can be put in an adapter that allows it to be placed into
the floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the ordinary PC, Kodak is producing a $10,000 machine
that will allow photographers to insert memory cartridges into a
slot and have pictures printed automatically. Those machines are
now being installed in photography shops.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of Internet sites _ www.photopoint.com,
www.photoloft.com, zing.com, clubphoto.com _ where digital pictures
can be e-mailed for storage, shown off in photo albums and
contests, or be made into prints.
</P>
<P>
   Sony makes one of the most popular cameras on the market now
because it uses a floppy disk that slips right into a personal
computer. The disk, however, has limited storage capacity _ 2
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Many digital cameras have a zoom lens. An optical zoom lens
works just like the zoom lens on a film camera, bringing the image
closer. A digital camera with a digital zoom enlarges the image by
using a smaller part of the sensor, which causes the image
resolution to drop off.

   Digital cameras have a lot more buttons and knobs than most
conventional cameras, but the buttons can be ignored and the camera
allowed to operate automatically. The buttons let the operator
correct color for the type of light, remove ``red eye'' in
portraits, and adjust resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is limited. When the LCD is turned on, standard
batteries can run out after seven pictures, and rechargeable
batteries last even less _ although they're cheaper in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures can be printed, at a cost now slightly higher than
prints for film, either on home printers or at photography shops.
The quality of the highest-resolution picture is close to the
pictures produced by film, but low-resolution enlargements can be
grainy.
</P>
<P>
   And digital photography remains expensive. Cameras for the
consumer market can cost $270 to $1,000; printers $400;
photo-quality print paper $1 a sheet; ink $30; batteries from $1.99
for standard to $60 for rechargeable batteries and a charger;
memory cartridges $28 to $130; and card readers and adapters, $60
to $100.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the drawbacks, the market for digital cameras is
growing rapidly. InfoTrends predicts 1.8 million cameras this year,
at an average price of $658, and 6.7 million in 2003, at an average
cost of $400.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, roll film cameras have hit a plateau of 15
million units a year, according to industry analysts.

MAKING BOOKS: WHEN SECRECY MEANS PUBLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the seemingly immutable axioms of book publishing is that
the purveyors of new books try noisily and at times shamelessly to
get as much advance, prepublication publicity as conceivable for
their product. But every season there are a handful of titles for
which there is the opposite impulse, with publishers just as
aggressively trying to suppress any early word of a book's
contents. These choice titles are embargoed. In this fall season,
less than one month old, there have already been four interesting
examples.
</P>
<P>
   The books were ``The Sword and the Shield'' (Basic Books), a
secret history of the KGB by Christopher Andrew and Vasili
Mitrokhin; ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII''
(Viking) by John Cornwell; ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan''
(Random House) by Edmund Morris; and ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the
American Man'' (William Morrow) by Susan Faludi.
</P>
<P>
   Generally books are embargoed because the publisher has sold an
excerpt to a magazine or made a deal with a television news
magazine program for first-use rights (called first serial rights).
But there are other reasons for secrecy. For instance, if the book
is alleged to contain news, or the mere fact of its publication is
news, then by releasing it to stores and reviewers on the same day,
a lucky publisher can orchestrate a tremendous burst of publicity,
and, hopefully, sales. (An example of this was ``Hannibal''
(Delacorte Press), Thomas Harris' sequel to ``The Silence of the
Lambs.'' It went on sale this summer but was so anxiously awaited
by readers and bookstore owners that the mere acknowledgment of its
existence produced a crescendo of book-selling publicity.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes a book is potentially so controversial or
it is such a lemon (or both) that the publisher wants to give it
some shelf time in the stores before it is buried in a wash of bad
reviews or mocking news stories.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to attempt to enforce an embargo. First,
there is the confidentiality agreement. To receive a copy of the
book the recipients, usually reviewers, have to agree to look and
read but not tell until a mutually decided-upon day. That is the
most common method, and it keeps the book's secrets, yet allows
book reviewers time to read and digest it. The other way is for the
publisher simply to keep all the copies out of sight, hidden until
they are shipped, timed to arrive on the reviewers' desks and in
the bookstores on the same day. Sometimes, although certainly not
always, the secret can be kept. But publishers admit there is
nothing more deleterious to the peace and sublimity of a publishing
house than the dreaded decision to embargo a book and the worry
that the embargo will be broken.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo was placed on the KGB book, which was based on a
secret archive, because its American publisher, Basic Books, had a
contract with the original publisher, Penguin UK, to issue it
simultaneously so that the publisher on one side of the Atlantic
would not be scooped on the other side. But, alas, ABC News
independently learned about the existence of the archive, if not
its contents, and broke the story nearly a week before the book's
scheduled publication, and this led to newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeown, president and chief executive of the Perseus Books
Group, of which Basic Books is an imprint, said: ``Frankly, in
retrospect, I don't think we were hurt. It turned out we were
better off. Hurricane Floyd would have buried us, and we wouldn't
have gotten a great amount of news coverage.'' The book had a first
printing of 80,000, but there are now 105,000 copies in print in
the United States, and the book will be No. 7 on The New York
Times' nonfiction best-seller list on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faludi's book, ``Stiffed,'' was embargoed because Newsweek
had bought first serial rights. Lynn Goldberg, the publicist for
``Stiffed,'' said that the magazine had a two-week window to
publish it first, either on Sept. 6 or Sept. 13, plus the right to
have it on the newsstand for a whole week before the book went on
sale. ``So we had it embargoed until Sept. 21,'' she said, ``but
Newsweek ran it on Sept. 6. An embargo is not only hard to put in
place, but it's also hard to dismantle, so we kept the publication
date at Sept. 21,'' but, of course, as soon as the magazine was
out, those who wanted to broke the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The book about Pius XII was embargoed because the publisher had
sold first rights to Vanity Fair magazine, which published an
excerpt in its September issue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the book embargo that will have the most notoriety was
the one on the Reagan memoir. Random House refuses to discuss the
book until its publication date, Sept. 30. It was embargoed mainly
for the usual reason: Random House had sold the first serial rights
to Newsweek, and, obviously, if the book's content became known
before the magazine was in readers' hands, the bang of exclusivity
that Newsweek paid for would be lost. But there was another reason
the book's contents were guarded with such ardor. The writer,
Edmund Morris, placed himself in the book as a fictional Zelig-like
narrator who first met the future president on Reagan's high school
football field, which was long before the real Morris was born.
</P>
<P>
   So in this case the main reason for the embargo was that the
contract with Newsweek mandated one, but there was also the desire
to get the book into the stores with some momentum before reviewers
could decipher what was history and what could well have been
borrowed from Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The book embargo has a relatively short but nonetheless
illustrious history. In 1979, The Nation magazine printed an
article based on a pirated copy of President Gerald R. Ford's
then-unpublished memoir, ``A Time to Heal'' (Harper &AMP; Row and the
Reader's Digest Association), which had sold first serial rights to
Time magazine. An appeals court eventually upheld The Nation's
right to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But the first book that anyone remembers being embargoed was
``All the President's Men'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), the seminal 1974
Watergate book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. How vigilant
does a publisher have to be to keep an embargo? Well, in that case,
according to someone associated with that publication, a man
purporting to be a reporter for one news organization was caught
climbing over the wire fence surrounding the warehouse where the
book's copies were stashed away.

   Wood in contact with the soil will eventually rot. Builders try
to prevent this by supporting framing members of a house, porch or
deck on masonry footings or a concrete foundation. Even with these
precautions it is possible for wood to rot if it gets wet enough
and if the temperature rises above the freezing mark.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that colonial homeowners were less troubled with wood
rot than we are today. It may have something to do with the fact
that the early settlers built their homes from timber cut from
first-growth trees _ trees that had been standing in the forest for
a century or more. The lumber from these naturally aged trees had a
dense cell structure that resisted water and rot.
</P>
<P>
   Other historians point out that colonial homebuilders took the
time to season wood before using it in a structure. The most common
method was a ''water-cure'' process in which the newly cut wood was
submerged in water, ideally a stream with moving water, for about
two weeks. The boards were then removed and allowed to dry in the
hot sun for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Many builders are aware that certain woods _ cedar, redwood and
cypress _ have a natural resistance to rot and insect damage.
Builders favor these woods in areas where moisture and warm
temperatures make wood rot and insect damage a serious problem. Yet
these woods are expensive primarily because they come from
slow-growing trees and are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make wood resistant to rot and insects, timber
suppliers have tried to treat boards with various chemicals. The
first chemical to be used was ordinary salt. It was sometimes added
to the water in the water-cure method and the boards were allowed
to soak and absorb the salt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1831, creosote a thin, tar-like fluid obtained from the
distillation of coal tar, was patented. At first it was simply
brushed onto the surface of the wood. Later, a pressure-treatment
method was developed where the lumber was immersed in the liquid
under pressure in containers. Pressure treatment forces the
chemical deep into the fibers of wood to make the board almost
invincible to the attacks of rot, fungi or insects.
</P>
<P>
   Though creosote is an effective deterrent, it has serious
drawbacks: it is flammable and boards treated with creosote cannot
be painted. Even more important, creosote has been determined to be
a health hazard. Today it is only used for industrial applications,
like in railroad ties, trestles and pilings.
</P>
<P>
   Lumber companies and the building trades looked for other
chemicals to replace creosote in pressure-treated lumber. One
option that was developed e was chromated copper arsenate, which is
accounts for about 20 percent of treated lumber sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another chemical that is used to make pressure-treated wood is
ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate.
</P>
<P>
   These compounds contain chromium, arsenic and copper _ all
toxic. They have to be toxic to kill insects and fungus, but many
people want to know if the treated lumber is safe to use around the
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Environmental Protection Agency maintains that,
according to their test results, the chemicals in pressure-treated
lumber remain fixed within the wood fibers and only small amounts
leak out. Still they caution that this wood cannot be used for
kitchen countertops, cutting boards or for food storage.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups feel that the Environmental Protection
Agency tests are not accurate enough. These groups have conducted
independent tests, reaching the conclusion that significant amounts
of chemicals can leech out from pressure-treated wood and
contaminate surrounding soil. For this reason, they caution
homeowners from using this lumber around vegetable gardens. In
addition, other safety authorities feel that is not advisable to
walk barefooted on decks made with pressure-treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, manufacturers introduced another chemical, alkaline
copper quat, which they claim is less toxic; but even wood treated
with that chemical includes a number of safety precautions. Some
builders maintain that wood treated with alkaline copper quat is
less rot- and insect-resistant than traditional pressure-treated
lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines for buying and working with pressure-treated lumber
will be discussed next week.

BRONFMANS TAME A TOWN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Greetings exchanged at the door with a private
security guard ricochet off the towering walls. A woman's heels
scrape stone as she trots up two flights. An alarm is briefly
triggered. It is move-in day, and the host, Clarissa Alcock
Bronfman, sweeps into the living room to greet her first visitor in
the lean, modern house she and her husband, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the
chief executive of Seagram Co., have just built for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The landmarked facade of their East Side town house has a
neoclassical restraint Edith Wharton would have loved. But step
inside, and you forget the past: Where wood once reigned, the
vestibule is now paneled in waxed sheets of steel in a shade of
warm bronze. Two steps up, a steel and glass door swings open to a
sun-filled two-and-a-half-story atrium court, replacing a
decorator-done parlor and as foreign to a hard-core Manhattanite as
Oz was to Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a loft, the fashion these days for nearly all
residential renovations. Nor is it a typical town house, dark and
cloistered. The piazza contains a striking skylight and little
else: there are broad limestone steps flanked by two wide ledges
holding a larger-than-life-size Nigerian fertility statue and an
artist's carved spheres of polished roots.
</P>
<P>
   The living room is almost as spare, dominated by a Corbusier
chaise beneath a monumental Roberto Matta painting. ``I don't want
any more things in here _ I want it to be about the architecture,''
Ms. Bronfman, 33, said, adding with a sporting sense of challenge,
``I'll just figure out another way to make it more intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how easy it will be to feel at home under the eyes of a
private guard and a house manager who materializes with a cell
phone clipped to his belt (the millennium edition of the bygone
butler and the bell cord) is still unresolved. But Ms. Bronfman is
trying. When the major-domo proffered bottled water, she uncapped
it and swigged. Their architect, Peter Rose, had done his part: at
the urging of Ms. Bronfman, who is Venezuelan, he removed the core
of the house to create a courtyard ``piazza'' that echoes the
leisurely comings and goings of Mediterranean life. ``Give me a
court in the middle, in honor of my Latin upbringing,'' she had
said. ``Light means happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rose, it was a chance to break out of the stuffy hierarchy
of a grandiose parlor floor and a layout in which family members
are removed from one another's view. ``The model of the town house,
for all its aspirations, is uncomfortable,'' said Rose, 56, who
tries to capture the magic of moving through unhindered spaces with
constantly changing viewpoints. ``I never loved the stacked sixplex
with its grand stair going up to something not very important. I
wanted to create options and a momentum so that all the power isn't
turned over to a living room that isn't used much.''
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate this scrutiny-shy couple with three children who
wanted an absolute division between public and private realms, Rose
conceived a plan with the complexity of a Chinese puzzle. The lower
three public rooms _ dining room, then living room and library _
lead off the soaring sky-lighted atrium court. And each room has a
view of another across the court, and of the street or garden
beyond. The library, which has an interior window and a balcony, is
meant to be a pivotal in-between space where the family can spend
time with close friends.
</P>
<P>
   The skylight actually works as a kind of false ceiling. Visitors
would hardly suspect that there are two-and-a-half stories of
bedrooms above, reached only if you know which white panel is a
secret door to a network of back stairs and hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms above the skylight feel secluded as well as airy
because the architect arranged them around a second courtyard open
to the air. The children's playroom has a small terrace; the master
bedroom has an inward-facing balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s family has a reputation for bold
architectural one-upmanship. It was his aunt, Phyllis Lambert, who
commissioned Mies van der Rohe to design the Seagram Building in
1958, the paragon of a modern office tower. So why not reinvent the
town house, too?
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are surprisingly small for a house pushing upward of
15,000 square feet _ who ever heard of a master bedroom on the
Upper East Side too small for anything but a bed, a fireplace and a
bookcase? ``I'd be happy if there was only a bed,'' Bronfman said
graciously (his wife happened to design theirs, a curvaceous wenge
wood platform).
</P>
<P>
   As one moves about the house, getting there is half the fun _
and the challenge. On the first of three landings, doors give way
into the narrow dining room and backyard beyond, with four linden
trees (a Weber barbecue parked beneath one) to block the neighbors'
view.
</P>
<P>
   The stairs continue climbing the wall, like a vine, to the
average-size living room. On the last flight, to the library, the
steps become narrower, with a four-inch gap between the tread and
the wall. It could almost be a goat path in the Italian Alps.
Bronfman loves the look; his wife worries about the safety of their
three small children, but the architect recently added a plastic
safety guard. (Attaching bungee cords to the children could work as
well.)
</P>
<P>
   The courtyard feels something like a minimalist opera set for
``Cavalleria Rusticana.'' But the placement of these small rooms,
all on different levels, dispels the theatrics of the large central
space. Rose is known for his artisan's love of solid building
materials, craftsmanship and old-fashioned building methods: He was
the architect of the Canadian Center for Architecture, a museum in
Montreal founded by Ms. Lambert. She put her nephew in touch with
Rose after Bronfman admired the museum's logic and elegance. ``With
Peter, there's so much care about detailing and a sense of space,''
Ms. Lambert said. ``You always know where you are and where you're
going.'' She had expected her nephew to go for a more conservative
choice, she told Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, she said more recently: ``Edgar does come from the
Seagram Building _ it's part of his life. And Clarissa's there
pushing him towards modernism, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bronfman, whose uncle is a prominent architect in Caracas,
remembered how shocked she was to discover, while the pair were
dating six years ago, that her future husband's office in the
Seagram Building was decorated with English antiques. (She insisted
that he remodel it in a more contemporary style.) When they
contemplated living in a modern town house, Ms. Bronfman said, ``At
first, all Edgar wanted to know was, `Where's the molding, where's
the chair rail?'''
</P>
<P>
   The project took an excruciating four years, during which
Bronfman was re-focusing Seagram's from a liquor maker into an
entertainment giant, with the purchase of Universal Studios and
Polygram, to reflect his own love of show business.
</P>
<P>
   As the uncertain fortunes of Universal kept the family on the
verge of moving to California, Bronfman apparently underwent a
design conversion. By the end, he was requesting a steel wall in
the vestibule and a powder room sink of wenge. ``I told Peter two
things,'' Bronfman said. ``It had to be anti-artifice, no faux
anything. And it had to be noble, not grand, but something that
speaks for itself eloquently and quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose admitted that he never exactly understood what
``anti-artifice'' really meant. ``But I know I've responded to
it,'' he said, in the voice of someone well-acquainted with the
demands of powerful businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The details, executed with exacting authenticity, range from the
load-bearing walls (16 inches at the base tapering to 12 inches at
top) to leather-topped slide-out ledges in the library bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bronfman is interested in the details, too, especially the
practical ones. ``To architects, it's always all about esthetics,''
she said of her battles with Rose over everyday amenities like
broom closets on every floor (``I don't want to see any mop buckets
in the elevator.''); a place for clotheslines (How about those
bedroom balconies?); drains in the bathroom floor so her children
can splash at bathtime, and a pantry with bulk capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Venezuela, you never knew from day to day what the
political situation was going to be,'' Ms. Bronfman said, ``so you
always bought in bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is determined to counteract the house's formidable
tendencies. ``I never want it to be so neat and perfect that there
can't be Legos in the library or a stroller at the front,'' Ms.
Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   She admits to some initial angst about doing a contemporary
house. ``So many end up with a cold feeling,'' she said, adding
optimistically, ``But being a Latino, there are always going to be
a lot of people coming and going without announcing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be something happening,'' she said.
``That is going to be the life of our home.''

 &HT;    Doogie Howser grows up
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Neil Patrick Harris is 26.
</P>
<P>
   But the baby-faced ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' star still looks like
he gets carded at clubs.
</P>
<P>
   What's his secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I take these little blue pills,'' he says, laughing. ``No,
it's a lot of lotion. When I was younger, people would always say
to me, `Be happy because when you're older, you'll look younger.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has a lot to be happy about. He's starring in ``Stark
Raving Mad,'' a promising new NBC sitcom in which he plays a
neurotic book editor forced to work with an unorthodox horror
writer.
</P>
<P>
   While the odd-couple show is already being compared to, well,
``The Odd Couple,'' Harris says he watched a year's worth of ``Will
&AMP; Grace'' to prepare for the role. ``It's a great show, and it's a
little over the top and that was good for me to watch to see how
full-bodied my acting needed to be,'' says Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Acting is something Harris always wanted to do. The New Mexico
native capitalized on the break he received at 14 (he met a
screenwriter at a summer drama camp) by landing the role of a young
boy troubled by his parent's divorce in ``Clara's Heart,'' starring
Whoopi Goldberg. After appearing in an episode of Burt Reynolds'
``B. L. Stryker'' in 1989, Steven Bochco tapped Harris to star in
``Doogie Howser'' as a precocious teen doctor coping with normal
teen problems. Harris showed both his comic and dramatic range on
the ABC show, which was canceled in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of that show and being known as that
character,'' says Harris. ``It wasn't like it was `Family Matters.'
It was a well-written Steven Bochco show.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a character Harris would like to put behind him. After
``Doogie'' got canned, Harris chose not to work in TV for several
years. ``It was important to have a respite from being seen in TV
before I was seen again,'' he says. ``It's detrimental to jump from
one show to the next because then you're known as being a TV actor.
I was going through so many physical changes, I just wanted to grow
up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that growing up, however, included college. Does Harris
miss having that kind of experience?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit, but I got such a great education on the
series,'' he says. ``But I missed a little of that social culture,
that feeling of being anonymous and just cavorting around in a
drunken stupor from bar to bar when you're a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Harris has certainly been keeping busy.
He appeared in ``Starship Troopers'' and played a cunning,
back-stabbing king in the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' Two years
ago, he made his musical debut in L.A.'s production of ``Rent,''
playing Mark, the aspiring filmmaker. ``I listened to that music in
my car for about a year before I got the part,'' he says. ``But
people were disappointed I was in it. They were like, `TV people in
`Rent'? Is that what it should be?'''
</P>
<P>
   His other stage credits include starring roles in ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' ``Luck, Pluck &AMP; Virtue'' and ``A Fair Country.'' In fact,
Harris says he'd like to direct theater one day. ``I've always seen
things from the big picture, instead of that tunnel-vision focus
actors tend to have,'' he says. ``I like to be in charge of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris co-stars with Madonna and Rupert Everett in the feature
film ``The Next Best Thing,'' playing Everett's sick, gay friend.
</P>
<P>
   So, how was Madonna?

`ETHEL &AMP; ERNEST': MUM, DAD AND NOT ALWAYS SO MERRY OLD ENGLAND
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Publication notes at end of article.)

<P>
   So at last we meet the models for the amusing working-class
characters in Raymond Briggs' inimitable comic-strip books for
children and adults, ``Father Christmas'' and ``Father Christmas
Goes on Holiday,'' among others, and even the terrifying ``When the
Wind Blows'' (1982), about an English couple living and dying in
the wake of a nuclear holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   These models are Ethel and Ernest Briggs, the artist's parents,
and while they don't experience an atom-bomb attack in ``Ethel &AMP;
Ernest: A True Story,'' they suffer all the other vicissitudes of
civilization from the late 1920s until their death in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In sequences of expressive cartoon panels punctuated with
frequent vaudeville-like word-balloon exchanges, the two of them
meet in London in 1928, fall in love and decide to marry.
</P>
<P>
   She ends her employment as a parlormaid:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like leaving them,'' she tells Ernest. ``They're so
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serve em right,'' he responds. ``Bloated plutocrats!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to swear, Ernest.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps working as a milkman:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you'll ever be promoted?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bloomin' fear! Not me! Yard foreman? Stuck in a tin shed
all day, adding up rows of figures? Blow that for a lark. I like
the fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   They buy and furnish a house, bear and rear a son, survive the
Depression and World War II, adjust to the advent of the nuclear
age, the Cold War and the welfare state and cope with technological
change and the waywardness of their artistic son:
</P>
<P>
   ``Art school! Oh, blimey,'' says Ernest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a shame,'' responds Ethel. ``He might have gone to
Oxford and Cambridge and got a nice job in an office.''
</P>
<P>
   In time they get used to their son's ways, although Ethel can
never give up offering him a comb for his long hair or accept that
because of his wife's emotional illness, she will never make her a
granny. At the end, Ethel and Ernest grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary existences lived countless times. Yet in the details of
Briggs' sparkling cartoons, the characters become richly specific
and endearing. For instance, the couple's dumbstruck reaction to
their first glimpses of each other is caught in the near-wordless
opening 35 panels, where she cleans house and catches sight of him
bicycling by: She waves at him with her dust rag; he doffs his cap
and grins jauntily. They quickly come to count on their greetings
and grow disconsolate when by chance they miss seeing each other.
</P>
<P>
   So you expect Ethel to be overwhelmed when Ernest shows up at
the front door on Saturday asking her, ``How about coming to the
pictures with me?'' But impishly, Briggs makes her more impressed
by the bouquet he is carrying than by his invitation, although of
course she happily goes with him.
</P>
<P>
   This subtly establishes how much more important to her are the
outward signs and symbols of behavior than their inner meaning, an
attitude later comically reflected when Ernest, reading the
newspaper, remarks: ``At last! Churchill's taken over: `Blood,
toil, tears and sweat.''' And she, bearing cookies from the oven,
responds: ``ERNEST! Don't! Disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she can appear almost noble in her devotion to proper
appearances, especially in a scene in which on a blustery day she
puts out newly washed sheets on the clothesline and looks for all
the world like a graceful yachtsman unfurling a spinnaker.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is similar to ``When the Wind Blows,'' with the
characters appearing both pathetic and heroic in the face of
overwhelming events. Come war or reduced rations or the
``tele-vision,'' they carry on, Ernest hoping for the best from
Labor, Ethel with her faith in Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``We'll own all the coal soon. They're going to nationalize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``I bet we still have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Well, course we'll have to PAY for it, you daft
ha'porth!''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``So we won't OWN it, then, will we?''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Well, um ... not exactly ... but it means the profits will
go to the government instead of lining the pockets of the bosses!''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``And then the government gives the money to us?''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``NO!''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``So what's the difference then?''
</P>
<P>
   But finally the details of the illustrations are what make you
read through ``Ethel &AMP; Ernest'' over again. For instance, there's a
cat that shows up first when the couple are exclaiming over the
garden they've acquired with their house. As they get older and
settle into their routines, the cat shows up more often, lying on
their bed or sitting in front of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after Ethel dies, the cat acquires the name Susie and
becomes Ernest's substitute companion, even curling up next to him
at night and lying across his shoulders as he eats. In the last
three panels of Ernest's life, the cat can be seen leaping away
from him as he rises from the table with some sort of chest or
stomach attack, then pressing on the kitchen door to get out as
Ernest retches over the kitchen sink and finally, months later,
walking out into the spring garden as Ernest collapses to the
floor. Not cruel, this shadowy animal, but as seemingly indifferent
to the passing of a brave but insignificant life as is the great
wide world.

FEW CAN BEEF ABOUT TODAY'S LEATHER-BOUND FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cows are moooving into homes across America. Most are arriving
five hides at a time, stretched across sofas that lounge in family
rooms, dens and living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle-based Bon Marche stores, leather-upholstered pieces
are 45 percent of their furniture business, up from about 17
percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Shop for leather furniture today and the reasons for this surge
are obvious. These leathers are so soft and supple it's hard to
believe they're related to the cold, hard leather chairs and sofas
once found sagging around fraternity houses and waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Today's leathers also come in styles ranging from contemporary
and transitional to traditional. Shoppers can pick colors ranging
from coral to plum along with the blacks, beiges and dark greens
that seem to dominate furniture showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these new leathers even come with pedigrees. Fashion
designer Ralph Lauren has put his label on leathers for the home.
Coach, a name synonymous with durable handbags, launched a leather
line earlier this year with Baker Furniture _ a well-known United
States maker and distributor of fine furniture.
</P>
<P>
   John Black, vice president of design and development for Baker,
says Coach wanted furniture as classic as its handbags. ``It's
leather from an American point of view, scaled to the American
home,'' Black says.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hatfield, divisional vice president of furniture for The
Bon, says his company decided in the early 1990s to offer better
quality and more styles of leather to customers. For years leather
had been associated with contemporary decor.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive retailers, prices under $1,000, more styles and
dramatically improved leather quality have made this furniture even
more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Add wearability and versatility into the mix and it becomes
``must have'' for more and more shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Baron, the U.S. executive for Natuzzi leathers of Italy,
says leather sales escalated in the 1980s when Macy's department
store and Natuzzi came up with a leather sofa to retail for $999.
``That was the shot heard 'round the world,'' Baron says.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, leather has become just another all
natural upholstery option, like wool, cotton or linen.
</P>
<P>
   According to research by Ikea, a leather sofa can last about
four times longer than an upholstered piece. But shoppers need to
consider how it's going to be used. Subject even the hardiest
leather sofa to climbing toddlers, large dogs and constant use and
it's not going to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Morrissey, furniture manager for Ikea, says sales of
leather furniture are up about 30 percent over last year. Her store
focuses on three grades:
</P>
<P>
   _Entry-grade leather that's treated to make it stronger, and may
have a pattern embossed on the hide.
</P>
<P>
   _An intermediate-grade that is more supple and feels and smells
like leather.
</P>
<P>
   _And Ikea's top of the line _ untreated buffalo leather with a
very natural look.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hatfield, the most luxurious and expensive hides
tend to be fully dyed analine leathers _ hides that have been
vat-dyed after tanning, so that color permeates the skin. That
means a scratch is less likely to be noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the selection of hides that makes the most visible
difference in a piece of furniture. Some are thicker than others.
Some hides have scars from insect bites or cuts. A hides buyer has
to be selective, Hatfield says. And when it takes about five hides
to make a sofa, it's important that they're very similar.
</P>
<P>
   Leather furniture made from cattle hides is a booming business _
jumping from $2.9 billion in U.S. retail sales in 1996 to about
$3.7 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Myers, president of Leather Industries of America, says
leather furniture is a rapidly growing market worldwide. U.S.
demand is so great that foreign companies are setting up factories
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leather upholstery has taken off like Boeing,'' he says from
his Washington, D.C., office.
</P>
<P>
   Myers says he has a favorite leather sofa, one that's only
gotten better with age. He's told his family he wants to be
shrink-wrapped with the sofa and buried in it.
</P>
<P>
   Leather furniture shouldn't be an impulse buy. It's a major
investment that lasts a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for a standard three-seat sofa range from $899 to about
$8,000 for a top-of-the-line model with a designer label. In
between are quality leather sofas made with hides from Italy for
about $2,499.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fabric, however, which comes with tags announcing fiber
content, leather has a different vocabulary: Analine dyed, suede,
nubuck, embossed (that means the pattern is imprinted on the hide)
_ to mention a few terms frequently seen and heard.
</P>
<P>
   When buying leather for the home, consider how it's going to be
used and where. Cow hides shouldn't be too near a heat source, or
placed in direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   And remember that not all leathers are created equal. Suede
finishes, for example, are soft, luxurious and sturdy but they
can't take spills. A greasy cookie or dropped hors d'oeuvre could
be disastrous. That's why suedes are more likely to be found in
low-traffic areas, or in homes without dogs or children.
</P>
<P>
   Although suedes can be treated with a stain guard, Jerry
Hatfield of The Bon Marche says to proceed with caution. It could
change the color.
</P>
<P>
   As in all upholstered pieces, the frame can't be examined when
you're buying, so ask if the frame is hardwood that's been fit
together with dowels and glue _ a sign of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Sit on a sofa arm _ see if it feels sturdy. Ask about the finish
and how to care for it. Most stores sell care kits with the
furniture at prices from $10 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to buy a leather sofa with a warranty, and to buy
from a retailer who's been around for a while and likely to be
there if needed.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to have black, brown or beige. They may be
very forgiving colors, but if you like off-white, remember that
leather is easier to maintain than a fabric of the same shade.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a leather sofa needs regular dusting, and an annual
cleaning according to manufacturer's directions.

 &HT;    Law &AMP; Order's new hunk in volatile position
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Talk about pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse L. Martin is certainly under it. As ``Law &AMP; Order'''s new
hunky detective, the 30-year-old Martin is stepping in where the
equally hunky Benjamin Bratt stepped out as detective Rey Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's supposed to be pressure,'' says Martin,
shrugging his coat-rack shoulders. ``You know, I'm going into a
slot once inhabited by Benjamin Bratt, who's one of the more
beautiful people in the world and everybody loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Martin smiles ... slowly. It's one of those smooth ladies
man smiles you see in dimly lit nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, I got my own thing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That he does. Martin, perhaps best known for playing Ally's
doctor boyfriend on ``Ally McBeal,'' makes his ``Law &AMP; Order''
debut tonight (10 p.m. EDT) as hot-headed detective Edward Green.
</P>
<P>
   And in typical ``Law &AMP; Order'' fashion, no big deal is made of
Green's arrival. When the episode begins, Green is already working
with Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) on a case where a gunman has shot
several women in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Martin, who in 1994 turned down a small ``Law &AMP;
Order'' role as a car stereo thief, get the gig?
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of came about because a little birdie told me that
there may be some cast changes on `Law &AMP; Order' and I went to Dick
(Wolf) and just asked for it and lo and behold, I got the job,'' he
says. ``If you talk to any New York actor, ``Law &AMP; Order'' is one
of those shows you've either been on or want to be on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'''s Steve Harris better watch out. ``Law &AMP;
Order'''s Green has the potential to be one of TV's most complex
African-American characters. In the opening episode, we already
learn that he likes to gamble (while on a case he high-tails-it to
Atlantic City to play poker), is prone to using excessive force (he
makes ``NYPD Blue'''s Sipowicz look like an aging neighborhood
watch patrolman) and has a smart mouth (he calls Briscoe ``Old
Spice''). Oh, and we'll learn later that he and Van Buren (S.
Epatha Merkerson) will bump heads in the squadroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, ``Law &AMP; Order'''s creator, says there will be a
generational and attitudinal difference between Green and Van
Buren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had two African-Americans in the front who are not
going to be in lockstep,'' says Wolf. ``It's not going to be
racial, it's going to be two African-Americans disagreeing
strenuously about the way business should be conducted, which I
think is interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect those juicy storylines to play out quickly.
``The character information is going to be dealt out in eyedroppers
rather than soup ladles,'' says Wolf, ``but I think that gives the
writers a chance to go into areas that they haven't explored since
Jesse's character is a little bit more flawed than Ben's.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Martin: ``This guy's not perfect, and he's got a track
record of excessive force because he thinks he's doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has certainly done a lot of right things in his brief
career. Besides playing Ally's main squeeze, Martin was an original
cast member of the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning Broadway
musical ``Rent.'' He played an AIDS counselor on ``413 Hope St.,''
Fox's ill-fated drama and recently played an alien baseball player
in an ``X-Files'' episode directed by David Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, took some heat while on ``Ally McBeal.'' The
show was criticized by some since race was never raised during Greg
and Ally's relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually very glad that I didn't have to work under that
weight,'' he says. ``I suppose as a white actor, you never have to
go into a relationship on television and say, 'Wow, I'm a white
actor and you're a white character. That's wild that we're working
together, right?' One of the cool things about doing that show was
that (it) never came up. It was more about the relationship than
anything else. Everybody in th

   LIFE-IN-AMERICA23 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ David Eldridge never thought
of high school football as a healer. The Lebanon High School
football parent, however, had his eyes opened last season when he
said last year's state champions transformed a town divided over a
school levy and other matters. ``It brought the community together.
It gave us something to rally around. People put their differences
aside and the school is better for it,'' Eldridge said. ``If the
football team is down, there's not that aura of cooperation amongst
everybody.'' He said football lets people cast aside prejudices
rooted in educational or financial differences. Respect becomes
performance- and effort-based. Ned Drees could have told Eldridge
all about the power of high school football. (Reines, Dayton Daily

   TAIWAN-QUAKE _ PULI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese by the thousands
threaded across half-ruptured bridges Wednesday, past fresh
rockslides and across miles of rippled asphalt to search for
relatives at the epicenter of the Taiwan earthquake. They found
that nature had dealt capriciously with this mountain town of
89,000 people closest to the quake's ground zero. Here and
elsewhere in Taiwan's hardest-hit Nantou County it looked as if the
quake had hopscotched across the landscape like a giant tornado,
devastating one place while leaving adjacent territory seemingly
untouched. Developing. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service). 30.

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to their anti-American cause and
when they failed tried to discredit the civil rights leader as an

researched KGB files. The book also says that Soviet agents tried
but failed to influence Andrew Young when he was the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations under President Jimmy Carter.

billions of tax dollars it spent on treating smoking-related

   WACO-PROBE _ WASHINGTON _ In a sign of startup difficulties for
the investigations into the 1993 Waco siege, special counsel John
Danforth complained that Senate investigators went to Texas
``without even troubling to give me a call.'' Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, sent back a message that he hadn't
known about the visit, either. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., had
sent the aides. Senators were divided on whether to conduct their

   LIFE-IN-AMERICA23 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ David Eldridge never thought
of high school football as a healer. The Lebanon High School
football parent, however, had his eyes opened last season when he
said last year's state champions transformed a town divided over a
school levy and other matters. ``It brought the community together.
It gave us something to rally around. People put their differences
aside and the school is better for it,'' Eldridge said. ``If the
football team is down, there's not that aura of cooperation amongst
everybody.'' He said football lets people cast aside prejudices
rooted in educational or financial differences. Respect becomes
performance- and effort-based. Ned Drees could have told Eldridge
all about the power of high school football. (Reines, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

LOTS OF GOOD KIDS' BOOKS OUT THERE BEYOND `HARRY POTTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor child. All summer you pranced like a racehorse nervously
awaiting the bell, then bolted to the bookstore the minute the
third ``Harry Potter'' went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   You raced through it faster than you can say ``Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' wishing the home stretch would never
come and then ... it ended, at page 435.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the book's Sept. 8 release, you've already read
it. Maybe twice.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? It'll be a whole year before Scholastic publishes the
fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's phenomenal ``Harry Potter''
series.
</P>
<P>
   And next time you can't cheat and buy the British edition ahead
of time, because future books in the series will be published
simultaneously in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, you might have to _ dare we say it? _ READ SOMETHING ELSE!
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there are lots of terrific books right up your alley _
full of fantasy, humor, adventure and pluck.
</P>
<P>
   To help us steer you straight to a great read, Christy McDanold,
owner of Secret Garden Children's BookShop in Ballard, gathered a
crateful of must-reads for ``Harry Potter'' fans.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring you'd already heard of Roald Dahl and Lloyd Alexander _
No? What a ghastly omission _ we selected some others that
especially piqued our interest.
</P>
<P>
   We also polled other booksellers and threw in a couple of our
personal favorites. Unless noted, most titles are for ages 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   So power up your Firebolt racing broom and let's get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firegold,'' by Dia Calhoun (Winslow Press, 286 pages, $15.95
hardcover, $9.95 paper)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone dreams of discovering the talented ``unknown'' who's
destined for great things. McDanold thinks she's found one in
Calhoun, a first-time author from Tacoma whose originality and fine
writing compensate for the low-budget look of this fantasy novel
from a startup press.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathon, haunted by the sense that he is different, wonders if
he is descended from the dreaded Dalriadas, the mountain folk with
magnificent horses and mystical powers. When everyone blames him
for a blight that destroys the valley's apple orchards, he escapes
to the Red Mountains in search of answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dark Is Rising,'' by Susan Cooper (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 244
pages, $3.95 paper)
</P>
<P>
   On his 11th birthday, Will Stanton learns he is the last of the
Old Ones, immortals dedicated to thwarting evil. Now he must find
six magical signs that will aid in the final battle against the
Dark. A Newbery Honor, Carnegie Honor, and Boston Globe/-Horn Book
Award winner. ``The excitment (sic) went on and on,'' wrote one
young reader on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: ``The Grey King,'' from the same series, won the 1976
Newbery Medal. Put this author on your list.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.S.: Cooper's new book is a time-travel adventure called
``King of Shadows'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 186 pages, $16). Check it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dragonslayers,'' by Bruce Coville, illustrated by
Katherine Coville (Pocket Books, 119 pages, $3.99 paper).
</P>
<P>
   Coville has many books to tantalize ``Harry Potter'' fans,
including ``Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher,'' and a new series
called ``Into the Land of Unicorns.'' The second title in that
series, ``Song of the Wanderer,'' is due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, slightly younger kids will find an easy route to
excitement in ``The Dragonslayers,'' a light-hearted adventure
about an old squire, a young page boy and a willful princess who
must stop arguing long enough to dispatch a spiteful
witch-turned-dragon. Opening line: ``Do you have the lizard snot?''
asked Grizelda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Wizardry,'' by Diane Duane (Harcourt Brace, 356 pages, $6
paper)
</P>
<P>
   In this second book of Duane's ``Wizardry'' series, two
13-year-olds on summer vacation join with a whale wizard and become
whales themselves to battle the sinister Lone Power. ``A powerful
tale of sacrifice and redemption,'' says School Library Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elidor,'' by Alan Garner (Harcourt Brace, 173 pages, $6
paper).
</P>
<P>
   Four children explore an abandoned church in a Manchester slum,
then are drawn into another world, where they must try to overcome
evil and guard the unicorn Findhorn. First published in Britain in
1965 and shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal, it's out in a new
American paperback edition. ``Intelligent, rich and terrifying,''
says the (London) Times Literary Supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ella Enchanted,'' by Gail Carson Levine (HarperTrophy, 232
pages, $5.95 paper)
</P>
<P>
   This acclaimed novel for ages 8 and up tells how a spunky
princess tries to break the curse of a well-meaning but foolish
fairy who has ``gifted'' her with obedience. ``If you commanded me
to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it,'' Ella tells readers.
``I was in danger at every moment.'' A 1998 Newbery Honor book, it
also made best-of-the year lists of the American Library
Association, the School Library Journal and Publisher's Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Beginning,'' by Lemony Snicket (HarperTrophy, 164
pages, $8.95 hardcover).
</P>
<P>
   In a tone of delectable doom, the author (who's coming to
Seattle next month) warns readers away from this first volume in
``A Series of Unfortunate Events.'' Here the three Baudelaire
children suffer the sudden loss of their parents (whom we never
meet) and must thwart the wicked guardian who pursues their
fortune. Also out: Book 2, ``The Reptile Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Reader,'' writes Snicket (pen name in cheek), ``I'm sorry
to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely
unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky
children. ... One might say they are magnets for misfortune.'' Put
the book down at once, Snicket advises, and ``read something happy
if you prefer that sort of thing.'' As if.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mossflower,'' by Brian Jacques (Philomel, 431 pages, $21.99
hardcover. $5.99, editions by Avon and Berkeley)
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Jacques (pronounced ``Jakes'') has
enthralled preteens with his acclaimed Redwall series, featuring
bold-hearted, talking animals and scheming villains in days of
yore. The plots are meaty, with plenty of good-vs.-evil and
characters with unpronounceable names and dialects. Kids eat it up.
``Mossflower,'' the prequel to ``Redwall,'' pits Martin the Warrior
against two ruthless felines for leadership of the abbey. In
January look for book 12 in the series, ``The Legend of Luke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honus and Me,'' by Dan Gutman (Avon, 137 pages, $4.99 paper)
</P>
<P>
   A boy cleans out his neighbor's attic and finds a rare and
valuable T-206 Honus Wagner baseball card. The card magically puts
Joe in contact with Wagner himself, in a ``Field of Dreams'' sort
of way, and helps Joelay to rest a sad mystery. Original,
thought-provoking and a quick read.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Wizard of Earthsea,' by Ursula K. Le Guin (Bantam, 184
pages, $6.99)
</P>
<P>
   The Earthsea Cycle, with more than a million copies in print,
invites comparisons with Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Here, in book one,
the great sorcerer Ged is recalled as a power-hungry youth who
unleashes a terrible shadow over the world. Reader comments on
Amazon.com range from ``It STUNK!'' to ``These books will stay with
you for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Wedding for Wiglaf,'' by K.H. McMullan (Grosset &AMP; Dunlap, 91
pages, $3.99)
</P>
<P>
   Here's light-hearted action for the younger set _ say third
grade. In book four of the Dragon Slayers' Academy series, Princess
Belcheena seeks a husband with red hair who has killed at least two
dragons and whose name begins with ``W.'' When the headmaster of
the Dragon Slayers' Academy hears there's a matchmaker's reward,
guess whom he nominates?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Well-Wishers,'' by Edward Eager (Harcourt Brace, 220
pages, $6)
</P>
<P>
   Eager's magical novels, dating back 40 years, are out in a new
Young Classics paperback edition. In this sequel to ``Magic or
Not?'' a group of children plunge into further outlandish
adventures through the magic of an old wishing well.
</P>
<P>
   Eager, who died in 1964, considered E. Nesbit the finest
children's book writer of all time and often cited her as his
inspiration. So it's timely that Nesbit's classic novel, ``Five
Children and It,'' has been reissued this month in a deluxe
hardcover edition illustrated by Caldecott Medalist Paul O.
Zelinsky (Morrow Books of Wonder, 242 pages, $22).
</P>
<P>
   ``Protector of the Small: First Test,'' by Tamora Pierce (Random
House, 216 pages, $16).
</P>
<P>
   ``First Test'' advances the plot of ``Alanna: The First
Adventure,'' (Random House, $4.99 paperback), about a girl who
disguises herself as a boy to become a knight. Moving ahead a
generation, ``First Test'' introduces Kel, the first girl to train
for the knighthood. Unfortunately for her, the narrow-minded
trainer Lord Wyldon isn't big on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mirror of Merlin,'' by T.A. Barron (Philomel, 320 pages,
$19.99)
</P>
<P>
   New this month: the fourth book in Barron's well-received series
about Merlin's early years. Other titles are ``The Lost Years of
Merlin,'' ``The Seven Songs of Merlin'' and ``The Fires of
Merlin.'' Booklist says this series ``just keeps getting richer in
characterization, ambience and Celtic lore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Compass,'' by Philip Pullman (Knopf, 416 pages, $20
hardcover, $5.99 Ballantine paper)
</P>
<P>
   Darker and more complex than ``Harry Potter,'' this rich fantasy
and its sequel, ``The Subtle Knife,'' have a large adult following.
Still to come: the final installment of the trilogy, collectively
titled ``His Dark Materials.'' The series describes the sometimes
bleak adventures of two children, Lyra and Will, whose ability to
slip between worlds sets them on a perilous quest to find the
origins of the universe and halt the course of evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuck Everlasting,'' by Natalie Babbitt (Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux, 139 pages, $4.95 paperback, $16 hardcover)
</P>
<P>
   In this profound and beautifully crafted novel, 10-year-old
Winnie Foster stumbles onto a family that has drunk from a fountain
of eternal youth. Between being kidnapped and helping an accused
murderer out of jail, Winnie must decide whether to accept an offer
of everlasting life with all its burdens and complexities.

CANDIDATE SUES NEWSPAPER FOR LACK OF COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Martin Eng, one of 14 candidates running for
mayor, is suing the San Francisco Chronicle, saying that the
newspaper has ignored his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Sept. 15 in San Francisco Superior Court,
accuses the Chronicle of being negligent in its duty and of
violating Eng's civil rights by excluding him from its coverage of
the mayor's race. Eng seeks compensation for ``economic loss,
humiliation, harm to reputation and emotional distress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle ran profiles of the three leading candidates _
Mayor Willie Brown, Clint Reilly and former Mayor Frank Jordan _
earlier this month. None of the other 11 candidates was profiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win this suit all the way, I think it will change the
whole fundamentals on news reporting on candidates,'' said Eng, a
real estate broker who was president of the Chinese-American
Republican Club in the mid-1990s but is now an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Eng suggested the Chronicle's actions were related to his being
the only Chinese-American candidate but would not elaborate on the
connection. His lawyer, Edward Simpson of San Francisco, also would
not clarify any aspect of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says: ``The actions of the Chronicle in not
reasonably and fairly reporting with respect to Eng's candidacy ...
are on information and belief due to Eng's race and are thus
discriminatory. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's general counsel, Ronald Ingram, said he would
not comment on litigation and has not yet been served in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara O'Connor, a professor of communications at
California State University at Sacramento, said of the lawsuit:
``There isn't a chance in hell they'll prevail. There's no legal
grounds that will be sustained in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Media lawyer Kelli Sager said newspapers have a right to print _
or not print _ whatever they want, a right guaranteed under the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Supreme Court has very clearly ruled on this issue,''
said Sager, who is based in Los Angeles. ``They have said that a
newspaper is not obliged to run information about anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Connor said, ``There's a real danger from the public
policy perspective when legitimate voices are silenced. I do think
the media has a responsibility to open up the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Managing Editor Jerry Roberts referred coverage
questions to Linda Strean, an assistant managing editor, who did
not return a call for comment.

`STARK RAVING MAD' LIKELY TO SUCCEED DESPITE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst that can happen to a new show is to be guaranteed
success from the get-go. Creativity suffers. Complacency sets in.
The show nevers seems to fire on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to ``Veronica's Closet,'' which started strong two
years ago but pulled up lame a few furlongs into its first season.
It stayed on the air because it had the NBC equivalent of Most
Favored Nation status: the 9:30 slot on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Better than a Nobel Prize, the time slot means huge ratings
(which allow the network to overcharge advertisers), enormous
paydays (which allow the actors to buy Porsches), and the
possibility of syndication royalties ad infinitum (which allows the
actors to pay for detailing on their Porsches).
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Veronica's Closet'' has been shuffled off to Monday
nights, the new beneficiary of the slot between ``Frasier'' and
``ER'' is ``Stark Raving Mad,'' a remarkably standard,
unspectacular new comedy that will probably finish the season in
the Nielsen top 10, possibly the top five.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a prissy, multiphobic book editor named Henry McNeely
(Neil Patrick Harris), whose principal client is a best-selling
horror writer named Ian Stark (Tony Shalhoub), who likes nothing
better than scaring the beluga out of McNeely, all in the name of
research.
</P>
<P>
   As the Felix Unger of this odd couple, Harris proves he's good
at slapstick, falling over furniture with the aplomb of an early
Dick Van Dyke. But Shalhoub, who's good at everything he does,
seems uncomfortable in the Oscar Madison role.
</P>
<P>
   It takes good chemistry between actors for the audience to think
there's no chemistry between characters. If Harris and Shalhoub are
waiting for spectacular ratings to help fuel their chemical
reaction, then they really are stark raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   Stark Raving Mad. Half-hour comedy series about a prissy book
editor and an earthy horror novelist. Starring Neil Patrick Harris
and Tony Shalhoub. Season premiere Thursday night on NBC. Parental
guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WITH MENCKEN AROUND, POLITICIANS DIDN'T HAVE A
PRAYER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often, usually in the slough of a political campaign, I
find myself returning to the works of H.L. Mencken. It is not any
ideological affinity that draws me but the inimitable effervescence
of the man's language. Particularly in the current combat, with so
many presidential claimants sporting religious credentials,
Mencken, who died in 1956, remains as impertinent and as pertinent
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist assigned to cover the campaigns of George W.
Bush, Al Gore or Elizabeth Dole, of Gary Bauer, Patrick J. Buchanan
or others must perforce tread carefully when the candidates allude
to alliances with religion. Who in the press is about to express
public skepticism about anyone's faith? Even the most impudent
critics, who feast on financial finaglings and sexual
indiscretions, shy away from questioning or giving offense when it
comes to professions of piety.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken had no such compunctions. Religion, particularly as
practiced by American go-getters, was his specialty, and skepticism
was a commandment. He hailed the skeptical approach as ``socially
very valuable, immensely more valuable, in fact, than any known
sort of faith.'' He rarely acknowledged that politicians might be
sincere about their religious beliefs, and, anyway, for him
sincerity was no excuse for what he deemed outlandish notions.
</P>
<P>
   The booboisie, as he liked to call his fellow Americans,
provided him with ``unfeigned delight,'' and in any period of
campaign smog his prose was an air purifier. For readers
unacquainted with his range, spirit and invective, here, from a
1922 essay, is his summary of American public manners: ``the
unending procession of governmental extortions and chicaneries, of
commercial brigandages and throat-slittings, of theological
buffooneries, of aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and
harlotries, of miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities,
grotesqueries and extravagances.'' He wrote, ``Only a man who was
born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh himself to sleep
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   What he called ``theological buffooneries'' occupy many pages of
his work. The exhibitions of religious fervor as primaries approach
sometimes bring to mind the knee-bendings of football players who
seem to believe that God cares who scores a touchdown. Many
assuredly must be in earnest, but it is not always easy to sort
faith from ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mencken evinced little admiration for the practices of
Roman Catholics and Jews, as a specialist in genus Americanus he
directed most of his animadversions at various manifestations of
Protestantism. In his book ``Treatise on the Gods'' he boasted that
he could invent any number of new sects ``and all of them would be
10 times as plausible'' as any then in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken's views of religious fundamentalism became famous
through his dispatches on the 1925 Scopes ``monkey trial,'' but he
went beyond the creationists when he took on ``the corps of
evangelical pastors ... a body devoid of sense and lamentably
indifferent to common honesty.'' He tells a story of a Frenchman
who was leaving the church of his fathers. When asked what variety
of Protestantism he planned to patronize, he replied, ``I have lost
my faith but not my reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then it has become impermissible for members of one
denomination to come out so rudely against the competition. But
Mencken, that ecumenical insulter, would surely have mined laughs
from a president's taking counsel with his pastor about his
relations with a young intern or of a vice president's sudden
appreciation of generous Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Menckenism gone out of style? One reason, of course, is
a deficiency of talent. Few journalists have written so bitingly or
humorously about public figures. But probably more important, by
the time of his death America's constraints on his sort of
invective had become more severe, and there were signs of further
constriction on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The casually disparaging cracks about selected groups to which
Mencken was prone had gone out of style. After the Holocaust it was
harder to make jokes about Jews, and as the civil rights movement
gained force, the nation became more considerate about references
to blacks. So, too, did sensitivity increase about Asian-Americans
and Latinos, the gay and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Even admirers of the Mencken spirit can welcome the increased
shows of tolerance, respect and diversity in America. Most people
take pride in the ability of different races and religions to live
together in reasonable tranquillity, well worth the loss of a
little easy humor. And yet, particularly when the political juices
are flowing and language turns to jelly, Mencken is missed.
</P>
<P>
   In his gentler moments Mencken could praise the Old Testament
for its literature and Christianity for its spirit of charity. But
mostly, by his accounting, the religious squadrons were composed of
con artists and their gulls. When it came to politicians, he found
religion being pressed into service ``as a sanction for moral
theories, for political and economic dogmas, for reforms (or
opposition to them) in laws and manners, for social protests and
revolutions and even for purely private enterprises, including the
commercial and the amorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting elected must be among the less discreditable of those
goals, but not even the naughtiest pundit these days is about to
echo Mencken's opinion that in America, religion ``is used as a
club and a cloak by both politicians and moralists, all of them
lusting for power and most of them palpable frauds.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, that's a broad-brush judgment, unfair and typically
Mencken. But in these months of piety ascendant, with politicians
and athletes and actors competing for heaven's support, it comes as
a breath of refreshing irreverence.

U.S. WARRANT HALTS RETURN OF A DISPUTED SCHIELE TO AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Portrait of Wally,'' one of the two disputed Egon
Schiele paintings once plundered by the Nazis and held in New York
under a grand jury subpoena until Tuesday, will not be going home
to the Austrian foundation that lent it to the Museum of Modern Art
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after New York's highest court set aside the subpoena, the
U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York
obtained a seizure warrant for the painting. The warrant, requested
by the U.S. Customs Service, cited federal laws prohibiting
smuggling, allowing seizure of stolen property and governing
violations in customs laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally,'' which the Modern had borrowed from the Leopold
Foundation in the fall of 1997 for a three-month exhibition, was
claimed on Dec. 31, 1997, by the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray, a Jew
who had to leave the work behind when she fled Vienna just before
World War II. The painting was sent to Austria's National Gallery,
which later traded it to Dr. Rudolf Leopold.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant did not cover ``Dead City,'' which has been claimed
by another family and can be returned. ``Wally'' will remain at the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bizarre situation,'' said Stephen M. Harnik, the
lawyer for the Leopold Foundation, who said he was called by the
Department of Justice on Tuesday afternoon. ``They had 20 months to
investigate this, and at 4 p.m. they didn't know if they were
interested in one painting or both. An hour later, they called back
and said `Dead City' is free to go. And then two hours later they
said they had obtained a warrant for `Wally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harnik said he had been questioned about the paintings by the
Justice Department in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that state
law protects art lent to New York institutions in all cases.

`CHICAGO HOPE': BACK WITH A DARKER VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new opening credits for ``Chicago Hope,'' with swelling
music and actors' faces taking turns on the screen, make it look
like a retread of ``Dynasty.'' That is exactly the wrong image. The
aging show had degenerated into soap opera. But with its creator,
the everywhere-at-once David E. Kelley, determined to revamp it,
the series returns Thursday night with a darker outlook: more
focused on medicine, more cynical about doctors and bloodier than
ever. Except for the blood gushing onto the operating room floor,
the sharper approach works.
</P>
<P>
   Though half the cast has been replaced, the series has not been
reinvented; it is still about a hospital in the forefront of
medical techniques. But it has taken on an ambiguous tone that
makes it seem like a companion piece to ``The Practice,'' Kelley's
piercing show about good lawyers, bad lawyers and, often, good
lawyers who do not-quite-legal things.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing part of Thursday night's ``Chicago Hope''
takes a similar approach to doctors, revealing some nasty
professional secrets. The story involves a patient who dies after
having liposuction. No one can find the plastic surgeon who
abandoned him in the recovery room, so two neurosurgeons, Gina
Simon (Carla Gugino, new to the series) and Aaron Shutt (Adam
Arkin, a mainstay from the old cast), argue about who has to tell
the man's wife he is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic surgeon (Bruce Davison, in a guest role) is found
trading stocks on the Internet. And depictions of the
money-grubbing, overextended aspect of the medical profession get
harsher. People scheduled for surgery may want to avoid this, or
they may want to watch in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a Kelley show without at least one ridiculous
over-the-top element, though. That comes Thursday night when a
priest is wheeled into the hospital. ``What have we got?'' Dr.
Keith Wilkes (Rocky Carroll, another good holdover) asks the
paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Severed penis,'' she answers, holding up a plastic bag full of
red fluid. ``It's right here,'' ready to be sewn back on. There is
a ludicrous explanation for the priest's condition, however
medically plausible the reattachment may be.
</P>
<P>
   With more emphasis on medicine, the show is left with the danger
that the characters will be no more than coat hangers for moral and
medical issues. Most additions to the cast have qualities so neatly
set up, the writers will have to struggle to make them surprising.
Barbara Hershey plays a cool, arrogant heart surgeon; cool and
arrogant go without saying for this show's heart surgeons. With
long red curls, she looks as if she's trying too hard to live up to
her glamorous name, Francesca Alberghetti.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Holly plays her opposite, a down-to-earth plastic surgeon
with flowing straight blond hair who sits with her feet on a chair.
Mandy Patinkin, who appeared in the series' early seasons, returns
as Dr. Jeffrey Geiger. Together, these three try to save a little
boy with a cleft palate and a life-threatening condition, Marfan
syndrome. Patinkin's character is the most absorbing, as he veers
between his deeply bred superciliousness and his devotion to his
young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley will not write all of this season's episodes. Next
week's, written by Gardner Stern, involves two men, one rich and
one poor, vying for a heart transplant. The script has a similar
dark vision of the medical profession and a similar undertone that
says the docs are basically good. Neither episode is wildly
engrossing, but both are intriguing enough to point toward a future
for the series and to justify this salvage mission on a show that
was ripe for cancellation.

   There's a lot to keep track of during the first episode of
``Third Watch.'' The principal characters (there are at least nine)
keep materializing and disappearing, darting from emergency to
emergency while they dodge the traffic, the smoke, the bullets, the
fire, the blood and the vomit. Maybe your head will spin. Maybe
that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some advice: Don't try to keep everyone straight. Things
will begin to sort themselves out by the end of Thursday night's
introductory hour on NBC. And here's a prediction: As this series
settles into its regular Sunday night slot, starting this weekend,
you will begin to care about these imaginary people nearly as much
as they care about one another.
</P>
<P>
   This ensemble drama series is about police officers and
paramedics on the 3-to-11-p.m. shift (the third watch) in a very
fictional New York City. They work in and around the 55th Precinct
station house and, just across the street, a firehouse known as
Camelot because it's at the corner of King and Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   What borough is that in? Fuhgeddaboudit. In this neighborhood _
which includes avenues called Lexington and Riverside and shiny,
silver elevated trains _ every municipal employee has a heart as
big as all Gotham and looks like, well, an attractive Hollywood
actor. But hey, don't hate them because they're beautiful. These
dedicated civil servants delight in the lives they save and agonize
over the ones they don't.
</P>
<P>
   No, these cops and ambulance jockeys aren't as gritty or
dyspeptic as the officers on ``NYPD Blue.'' These are more like the
doctors and nurses of ``ER.'' That's no surprise. The executive
producers of ``Third Watch,'' John Wells and Christopher Chulack,
are part of the team responsible for ``ER,'' NBC's dependable meal
ticket in these hungry times for network television.
</P>
<P>
   They borrow liberally from the ``ER'' prescription: appealing
characters tested in life-or-death crises, one after another. But
in sure hands the formula works.
</P>
<P>
   That formula depends heavily on strong casting, and judging from
Thursday night's episode, this team has what it takes. At Camelot,
you'll find a pair of bantering young paramedics named Kim (Kim
Raver) and Bobby (Bobby Cannavale), the only two cast members whose
characters share their own first names, as well as the veteran Doc
(Michael Beach), who is helping the sensitive rookie Carlos
(Anthony Ruivivar) learn the ropes. Over at the police station
you'll meet the hotheaded Bosco (Jason Wiles) and his partner Faith
(Molly Price), the overworked mother of two small children, as well
as the fatherly Sully (Skipp Sudduth), who has taken under his wing
young Davis (Coby Bell), the son of Sully's revered partner, who
died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Don't fret. And don't worry about Kim's ex-husband,
Jimmy the randy fireman (Eddie Cibrian), or about Mantooth, the
firehouse Dalmatian who likes doughnuts but not dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's script, by Wells, flings the characters into
crises from a car wreck to a tenement fire to a birth on the floor
of a subway car. All this gives them opportunities to display the
human qualities that bind them to one another and, more important,
to the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The most fascinating dynamics involve the two interracial
pairings of mentor and novice: the black Doc with the Latino
Carlos, and the white Sully with the black Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our job?'' Sully demands of his pupil at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, fresh from the academy, answers without hesitation,
``Enforcing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Sully snaps. ``We're solving problems. We go from job to
job solving problems as quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be an accurate or complete description of police
work. But it sounds like a solid foundation for a television
series.
</P>
<P>

AUSTRALIAN OINTMENT CAUSING A BUZZ AMONG ARTHRITIS PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURST, Texas _ It looks like axle grease and smells like
molasses and curry powder mixed with motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   It's messy to use and has been nicknamed ``the goo from Down
Under'' or simply, ``the goop.''
</P>
<P>
   And it costs $98 for an 8-ounce jar.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthritis Relief Plus contains many herbal ingredients
traditionally used to relieve pain and swelling, plus some credited
with rebuilding bones and joints. They are mixed in a coconut oil
base that some arthritis sufferers say carries the herbs deep into
damaged joints.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation classifies the ointment as an
``unproven remedy'' and says that topical pain relievers should be
used as part of a comprehensive program, but North Texas arthritis
sufferers who have used the ointment say they have found some
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Beebe, 75, of Colleyville, began arthritis treatments when
she was 28. She was given cortisone injections, wore copper
bracelets and strapped on magnets seeking pain relief. In January
1984, she had her right hip replaced with a steel ball and plastic
socket.
</P>
<P>
   She says she took anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers until
her doctor made her stop because she was developing stomach ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just putting up with it,'' she says. ``Some days were
worse than others. I had to have help stepping off or on a curb. My
son put an extra step at the back door to make it easier to get in
and out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in here last January with a cane,'' she says at the
Arthritis Relief Center in Hurst, which a neighbor recommended. ``I
told my neighbor that it won't work; but you hurt so bad, you're
willing to try anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Beebe says she told her doctor in July that he would laugh when
he heard how she finally relieved the pain in her right hand and
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't laugh at anything that works,' '' said
Beebe, who says her arthritis pain ended after 30 days of using
Arthritis Relief Plus _ and hasn't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Allen Martin, 77, of Hurst, who had his left knee
replaced and was considering a knee replacement on the right side
when his wife, Billie, dragged him over to the Arthritis Relief
Center in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery relieved pain in the left leg, but it is still a little
stiff, despite six weeks of physical therapy. For a month after the
surgery, her husband declared it ``the biggest mistake of his
life,'' Billie Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   He tried Arthritis Relief Plus, but after three or four weeks he
declared it ``a good idea that's just not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Martin persevered, rubbing in the cream all around his
knee and lightly wrapping it with an elastic bandage each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 30th day, he said, `I hate to say this, but the pain's
gone. My leg's not hurting anymore,' '' Billie Martin says. Allen
Martin is back at work doing carpentry repairs and maintenance
around the town houses where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis Relief Plus was developed in Australia 20 years ago to
help rehabilitate injured race horses and dogs. It was reformulated
several years ago in a less grainy ointment for humans, says Marta
Matthews, an Australian native who introduced the alternative pain
relief cream in this country about 18 months ago when she opened
the Arthritis Relief Center in Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   She sells primarily over the Internet and on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The herbal ointment is rubbed in at night and the affected joint
is wrapped lightly to keep the ointment from rubbing off and making
a mess. As with other topical pain relievers for arthritis, it
usually takes two to four weeks to begin working.
</P>
<P>
   To what do the ointment's advocates attribute its success?
</P>
<P>
   First, it contains capsaicin, a substance found in hot peppers,
which relieves pain by interfering with pain signals to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains English oak, an astringent shown to reduce
swelling; turmeric, an astringent with anti-inflammatory and
antibiotic properties, traditionally used on sprains and bruises;
winter cherry to relieve joint and nerve pain; fenugreek to soothe
inflamed tissue; Norwegian kelp for mineral deficiencies; Solomon's
seal (''knit-bone'') to help heal bones and bruising; and menthol.
</P>
<P>
   With no known side effects, the treatment is a welcome
alternative therapy for some. A recent research review published in
the New England Journal of Medicine found that traditional
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administered to treat
arthritis _ including aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium _ can
cause gastrointestinal ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is low, but because huge numbers of people take these
pain relievers, especially arthritis sufferers who take high doses
for long periods, toxicity from the drugs ranks as the
15th-most-common cause of death in the United States, says a report
in the September-October issue of Fitness Matters, the journal of
the American Council on Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthritis is not terminal, it's just debilitating,'' Matthews
says. ``What gets you in the end are the side effects to the drugs.
This has no side effects and doesn't interfere with any other drugs
you may be taking. If your knee hurts, you put it on your knee. If
your hand hurts, put it on your hand. There's no need for it to go
through your whole system.''

REFLECTIONS FROM ONE WHO CALLS WEDGWOOD HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY FRIAUF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There's no place in my world, no niche in my
psyche for this: a massacre in a church, across the street from my
old grade school. Kids from my old high school gunned down while
praying.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Shulkey Elementary, named for someone my mother-in-law
knew: a battle zone. Suddenly. In a neighborhood where nothing ever
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive dissonance, psychologists might say. Mourning,
ministers might say. Unimaginable, I say. The image of the
space-suited firefighter going into a church to look for a bomb is
the stuff of recurrent nightmares. And that was the mildest of the
scary things. So many people suffered so much and will suffer
immensely in the months and years ahead. I'm just a whiny lamenter,
a 1999 Greek chorus.
</P>
<P>
   When my family moved to Wedgwood in 1960, we were on the edge of
development. Our beagle roamed cow pastures and brought home trophy
rabbits. Wedgwood was a huge middle-class family place. Daddies
worked at General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) or Carswell Air
Force Base or sold insurance. It seemed unanimous that the moms
stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   I walked to Shulkey every day. Sometimes friends walked with me;
sometimes I walked alone. It didn't matter; nothing ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   We went to church every Sunday unless we were deathly ill. Most
everyone in the neighborhood did. We went swimming on summer
Saturdays. I learned to ride an old blue bike that got passed
around the neighborhood, with daddies running alongside. After a
movie theater opened in Wedgwood, our parents dropped us off, even
elementary-school kids, and picked us up hours later. Nothing ever
happened.
</P>
<P>
   We caught horned toads and dropped them when ``blood'' came out
of their faces. During the Cuban missile crisis, my friends and I
dug bomb shelters until we hit solid limestone. But nothing ever
happened.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up. I'm old enough to know that no place is safe from
violence. I know that the world has changed; I was night city
editor at this paper during Fort Worth's highest-crime period this
century. But when I drive to Wedgwood, I still feel immune.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting my mother four blocks from Wedgwood Baptist, taking my
children to YMCA summer camp at Shulkey, shopping in the fabric
store, I feel in my soul that Wedgwood is a safe place. This year,
no one killed anyone, January through August, in my old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ever happened there.
</P>
<P>
   Now something has.
</P>
<P>
   What do I do? What do I say?
</P>
<P>
   All I can tell my children is that you are as safe as Mommy and
Daddy can help you to be. And there's no cocoon anyone can put
around another human. In the face of inexplicable acts by people
with minds that aren't right, all we can do is seek to be part of
the solution.

MINISTERS TELL CHILDREN NOT TO LOSE HOPE IN WAKE OF TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Rev. David Hunt of Bethany Fellowship
Assembly of God
</P>
<P>
   prays with his 12-year-old son before school every morning, but
few mornings more fervently than the morning after the mass
shooting at a Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the slayings, father and son closed their eyes
and said aloud:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fear. I have power, love and a sound mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are bound to be worried about their children's faith in
the aftermath of last week's tragedy, in which a gunman fired
repeatedly into a crowded youth rally, killing seven before turning
the gun on himself. Ministers say that the days after a tragedy _
particularly a slaying in a sanctuary _ are an appropriate time to
teach youth about the sometimes complex aspects of developing a
spiritual life, especially if children are mature enough to begin
questioning religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do worry that young people just discovering religion will
begin to doubt God's love,'' said the Rev. Lloyd Taylor of
Southwood Baptist Church in southwest Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, ministers say, young people need to know they
are loved and have not been abandoned by God. And they need to know
that faith and hope are made for troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jonathan Ogujiofor, priest at St. Simon of Cyrene
Episcopal Church near Lake Arlington, said he was shaken as the
lights of police cars and ambulances swirled across his southwest
Fort Worth neighborhood after the shootings. He lives next door to
Wedgwood Baptist Church, where the killings took place.
</P>
<P>
   Three friends of Ogujiofor's 15-year-old son and 17-year-old
daughter were killed at the neighborhood church. The family prayed
that night, but Ogujiofor did not want to press too deeply into
spiritual concepts as the night grew late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were still too traumatized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he gave comfort first and, 24 hours later, he sat the
children down to talk.
</P>
<P>
   He told them: ``This is life, this is the way life comes and
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friends did not die because they were bad people. We all
die. The goal is to live well while we are here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God can and does allow things like this to happen. He teaches
us that `You cannot count on life, but you can count on me. If you
keep still, you will know I am right there, and you will know from
the comfort I will give you, from the power you receive by your
ability to overcome and bear suffering. You will know that I am
here.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The words don't come easily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will find that same eloquence when talking with a
child. Ministers say that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   At east Fort Worth's Hope Community Church _ where the
receptionist answers the telephone, ``Welcome to Hope'' _ the Rev.
Harold Bullock said: ``Don't just drop the facts on them and run.
Talk to them when there is a lot of time for them to ask
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to his own children, ages 13 and 10, and explained that
tragedies remind us how vulnerable we really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees to our safety.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that although there is pain, there is also a
great deal of beauty in life. It is normal to have both, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may want to blame God. They should know that being a
Christian does not mean they will be immune from tragedy,'' said
the Rev. Bill Bowers of Wedgwood Church of the Nazarene, which is
near Wedgwood Baptist. Bowers was preparing to offer a prayer
before the Fort Worth City Council meeting the night after the
shootings. But he paused to contemplate what we should tell the
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful things will happen. The main goal is for our soul to
be right, however long we have on this earth,'' Bowers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, the Rev. Paul Gomez stood in front of his
congregation, housed for now in the United Artists Fossil Creek
movie theater, and in front of the screen that normally flashes
scenes of violence, adventure and romance. In the stillness of the
theater, he often explains to his CrossRoads Church congregation
that humans were put on the Earth with the power of choice, and
thus bear a great responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had to choose to pull that trigger. They were not made
to do so,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   People can also chose to remain faithful, even in troubling
times.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers say they are concerned that Wedgwood Baptist tragedy
will send ripples of fear through the community.
</P>
<P>
   At Meadowbrook United Methodist Church south of downtown Fort
Worth, the Rev. J. Neil Norman told his teen and pre-teen children
that the answer is not to build bigger walls and better security
systems to keep gunmen out of sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get closer to people, not push them away,'' Norman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he is encouraging his children, and his
congregation, to spend less time on their own entertainment and
more time volunteering to help people in need, people who could
turn to desperate measures if they do not find some kindness at
some turn in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ connected with people who are outcasts, but we don't
take the time,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwood Baptist, Taylor agrees. Times like these, he said,
should strengthen our resolve to work for a better world.
</P>
<P>
   And ministers say that the belief that we can bring about new
beginnings through our own actions is a large part of what
Christian faith is about.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hunt prays with his son in the mornings, he takes time
to tell him: ``Faith is no good unless it's tested. Hope is no good
unless you get to use it.''

Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about Leonard de Paur and the Lincoln Center Out of Doors
Festival. 
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the propulsive beat of the Nigerian Fela Anikulapo
Kuti's music, the choreographer Ronald K. Brown led his 12 sinuous
dancers across the floor in fast, rhythmic movements, each stride
increasing the tension in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, horns and sirens blared on lower Broadway, and rain
lashed against the windows. Oblivious, the group advanced as one
and then froze, eyes lowered, their only movement the small,
nervous gestures they made with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The spectators were caught off guard. Just five minutes into
``Upside Down,'' Brown had already reached a wrenchingly emotional
place. It is a place he fruitfully visits often. ``Upside Down,'' a
section from a larger work, the 1998 ``Destiny,'' illustrates the
enormous effort and energy it takes to move toward inner peace in a
chaotic world. Like all of his work, ``Upside Down'' is, to Brown,
evidence of the human struggle.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown's aptly named company, Evidence, begins its one-week
engagement at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, it will present
``Upside Down'' as well as two other Brown works: ``Ebony
Magazine,'' to a score by the British composer Wunmi Olaiya, and
the New York premiere of ``Water,'' to music by the jazz composer
Philip Hamilton, the Nigerian composer Fahali Igbo and the a
cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock. Cheryl Boyce Taylor will
accompany ``Water,'' reading the poem she wrote for it.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece in the Joyce program exhibits the joyous physicality
and sensitivity to contemporary anguish that have made Brown, who
is 33, one of the hottest choreographers now working in modern
dance. All told, he has had an extraordinary year.
</P>
<P>
   It started last fall with a three-week season at Dance Theater
Workshop and continued with commissions from Philadanco and the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company. He also made new works for the
Spoleto U.S.A., Celebrate Brooklyn and Jacob's Pillow festivals.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will feature
his newest piece, ``Grace,'' during its season at the City Center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What thrust Brown into the spotlight? A combination of forces,
according to people in the dance field. ``Besides Ron's being a
gorgeous performer,'' said Martha Myers, dean of the school of the
American Dance Festival, ``he deals frankly with racial and sexual
issues. It's made him noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Maureen D. Knighton, executive director of 651 Arts
in Brooklyn, asked Brown to be artist in residence. ``He creates a
partnership with audiences,'' she said. ``He helps them process
complex subjects like racism, AIDS, love and loss. His work is
charismatic.''
</P>
<P>
   David R. White, executive director of Dance Theater Workshop,
began presenting him 10 years ago. ``Ron frames his works as
rituals,'' he said. ``This gives them resonance, a timeless
quality.'' Brown's series at the Joyce's Altogether Different
Festival in 1998 both packed the theater and pleased the critics.
The impressive showing encouraged Linda Shelton, the Joyce's
executive director, to ask him to open the season this fall.
</P>
<P>
   To win wide exposure, artists obviously need talent. But finding
presenters to support them is also critical. In the small field of
dance, most presenters know one another. ``We talk with each other
a lot,'' said Ella Bass, executive director of Jacob's Pillow,
``and often rally around an under-recognized artist to help find an
effective presence in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, an artist who shows work at Jacob's Pillow will
probably also be seen at the American Dance Festival, P.S. 122, the
Kitchen, Dance Theater Workshop and eventually at the Joyce or the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Does a choreographer automatically
ascend a ladder, starting with small venues like P.S. 122 and then
climb to the Joyce and the Brooklyn Academy? White responded with a
definite ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what they want to present,'' he said. ``Some
works do better in one place than in another.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Meyers Brown, artistic director of Philadanco (and not
related to Brown), isn't convinced that consensus among presenters
is a good thing. ``I think it often simply comes down to `flavor of
the month,' especially with black artists,'' she said. ``It seems
there's only one `black star' chosen every few years.''
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned Garth Fagan and Bill T. Jones as examples. But her
concern goes deeper. ``I worry that some of these overnight
successes aren't up to making back-to-back ballets. More is not
always better. They need time to stop and work on their art.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent hot, rainy day, Brown would have definitely agreed
that he needed more time after being rudely rushed out of a studio
for running a few minutes late in rehearsal. But for someone under
pressure, he seemed unusually composed as he sipped an ice coffee
in a nearby SoHo restaurant.

   ``A Star Called Henry''
</P>
<P>
   by Roddy Doyle
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Viking, $23.95
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans who remember Roddy Doyle at all don't even
remember him, but rather the ``The Commitments,'' a marvelous 1991
movie based on his novel of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commitments,'' film and book, concerns a scruffy bunch of
Irish teens from a resolutely working-class area of Dublin north of
the River Liffey. Enamored of people like Wilson Pickett, they form
a band, argue a lot, play one gig and sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At once hilarious and bittersweet, ridiculous and utterly
believable, the novel established Doyle as an Irish writer to
watch; his dialogue was utterly perfect, his narrative brisk, his
tone wonderfully conversational.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd ever been to Dublin, you could again smell the streets,
hear the musical-but-gruff voices of the streets and the pubs, and
see the children (who possess the liveliest, laughingest eyes of
any children anywhere) and young women, who are the most beautiful
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful as ``The Commitments'' was, though, it was merely
Doyle establishing a voice: warming up, taking batting practice, as
it were. He's written four novels since then, each as good as or
better than the last, culminating with ``The Woman Who Walked Into
Doors,'' one of the bleakest, saddest looks at family abuse ever
set to print.
</P>
<P>
   But all are connected by being set in modern (or at least
recent) Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Star Called Henry,'' then, is a departure; the novel is set
in the Ireland of the first two decades of the century, a time of
monumental changes, including rebellion, civil war and the
establishment of the Irish nation.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all _ horrible tenement poverty, murders, back
streets, assassinations, underground rivers, dead children,
reprisals, ambushes and secret alliances _ moves Henry Smart. Born
of a mother slowly going crazy from seeing so many of her infants
die, and a one-legged dad who guards the door of a whorehouse and
kills people for a shadowy underworld character, Henry grows up
fending for himself on the streets from the age of 5. He is in the
thick of things during the failed rebellion of 1916, and the years
of guerrilla warfare that lead to the establishment of the Irish
nation.
</P>
<P>
   How to describe ``A Star Called Henry?'' Think, perhaps, of a
cross between ``Angela's Ashes'' and Thomas Berger's ``Little Big
Man'' _ mixed in with a killer's-eye-view of the Irish revolution
and a fascinating look at Dublin street life. In Smart, Doyle has
created a fantastic character who inhabits the Irish night and the
margins of history: An impossibly handsome man who becomes a legend
mere hours after his birth, Smart rides like a cypher through the
smoke and gunfire of the war years without being photographed, his
presence unrecorded, training rebels in the countryside, sleeping
with dozens of women (including, in one vivid scene, his onetime
teacher, Miss O'Shea), haunted by memories of his youth and the
death of his brother Victor.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative might well disappoint those who hunger for some
sort of moralistic story about the Revolution, or of a kid fighting
his way out of poverty, as in ``Ashes.'' To me, Smart's moral
ambivalence _ and Doyle's ability to put him in a particular place
in Irish history without turning him into a martyr or a symbol _ is
the book's greatest strength.
</P>
<P>
   Smart is motivated as much by lust and adventure and simply
getting the heck out of poverty as by any lofty moral ambitions.
he's more than happy to have sex with Miss O'Shea while the
Revolution rages around him, for example, and he abandons his
fellows at the first opportunity for the rivers running under
Dublin, which his dad once showed him.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a sad, restless age, Smart knows abandonment and
has no qualms about killing. Doyle makes him and his story
thoroughly believable and involving, both by playing his fictional
story against history and through the use of vivid dialogue,
scene-setting and a cast of characters that includes tenement
women, fledgling revolutionaries, a deadbeat father, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Star Called Henry'' is a gem, a novel one simply hates to
see end, but it is an uneasy one. It offers perhaps Doyle's finest
and most memorable and contrary character, thrown into a momentous
moment in European history and always trying to run one step ahead
of disaster _ a fully realized human being who will not be beaten
by a life he never asked for nor fully understands. Smart is cruel,
he is sweet, he is devious, he is unbearably sad. He lives by
night, and to read only a few pages is to be consumed by his
endless struggle to survive against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   And among today's novelists, Roddy Doyle is the man. &QL;

 NEW YORK: SoHo restaurant.

<P>
   ``It's funny how all this attention feels on the inside,'' he
said. ``My dancers and I are more conscious of how some of us will
pay the rent and where's the next gig.'' He paused. ``I only hope
it brings other kinds of support.''
</P>
<P>
   His wish list includes fall and spring seasons in New York,
workshops in the winter and his own space, with a theater, where he
could establish an arts center. But right now, a consistent,
affordable place to rehearse would be quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved to put his worries aside for a moment, he talked about
the past. His love of dance goes back to childhood, he said. As a
boy, he and his cousins made up dances in his Brooklyn living room,
and he had fun at the Police Athletic League learning routines from
a dancer from the Broadway show ``The Wiz.''
</P>
<P>
   But when his mother went into labor with his younger brother on
the day he was supposed to audition at Dance Theater of Harlem, he
took it as an omen that he should forget such a ``sissy'' pursuit
and be ``a manly big brother.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader and writer, he decided to become a journalist
instead. His resolution didn't last long. A dance teacher talked
him out of it when he was 16, and he began studying ballet and
modern dance with Mary Anthony. In 1985, only 19, he established
his own troupe and named it Evidence because his dancers were
trained to embody ``evidence'' of their lives and times in their
movements. When he didn't get gigs, he performed with Ms. Anthony's
company and Jennifer Muller/The Works.
</P>
<P>
   Bessie Schonberg, the celebrated teacher, taught Brown to
choreograph. ``She was tough,'' he recalled. ``She'd ask: `What do
you want? What did you expect me to see?' If I was silent, she'd
say, `Speak up for yourself.''' He gained confidence and began to
tell stories about humanity, combining dance with danceable music
and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words,'' he explained, ``give people another element to grab
onto.'' His integration of movements from African and Caribbean
dance with his own sensuous, high-energy style began to make his
choreography more and more distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   His social commitment also set him apart. ``I want society to
get better,'' he said. ``I want to move things forward.'' His sense
of mission doesn't burden his work. The dance ``Ebony Magazine''
criticizes the values of glossy magazines but does so with humor.
``Choreography has to be about what can't be written or painted or
sung,'' he said. ``Ultimately, it has to be its own thing. I don't
want to tell you what I'm feeling; I want you to see what I'm
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's ideas come to him as images. ``Water'' originated in
Brown's mind as scenes of men in bloody clothing running down the
street and wrestling with one another. ``Make a contemporary
warrior dance,'' suggested his friend the composer Fahali Igbo,
when Brown revealed his thoughts. ``Show how young black men are
wasting their warrior natures and can do something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, water images came to him, memories of people he'd seen
washing for prayer in West Africa. He called Ms. Taylor, told her
his impressions and asked her to write something for his new work.
The next day, she delivered the 10-page poem that accompanies
``Water.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Joyce, ``Water'' won't be the same piece that was seen at
Jacob's Pillow last summer. ``I'm still changing it,'' Brown said.
``My dances aren't fixed; they're physical journeys. They're my
sole focus. Recently, a friend got angry with me because I said I
didn't want to perform at the Met. I guess I'm supposed to have
grand ambitions now.'' He laughed, as if to say, ``Isn't making
dances wonderful enough?''

DOONESBURY CREATOR CAN'T RESIST BEATING AROUND THE BUSHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Former President George Bush says cartoonist
Garry Trudeau is ``spoiled, derisive, ugly and nasty.'' Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush once called him ``the slime of the Earth.'' Barbara
Bush says the Doonesbury creator has devoted his life to ``cutting
down'' other people.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bush family has another reason to scorn Trudeau _ in
fact, a whole series of them.
</P>
<P>
   After recently tweaking Texas Gov. George W. Bush over unproved
allegations of past drug use, Trudeau has devoted this week's comic
strips to a long-forgotten controversy from the days when he and
Bush were students at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   The running gag revolves around the allegation _ first raised by
the Yale Daily News in 1967 _ that Bush and fellow members of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity were branded with a frat symbol.
Bush says it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any brands on me,'' Bush said in an October
interview with the Star-Telegram. ``There was a kind of rush-week
silliness that goes on, but there was no branding.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides and friends of Bush said the governor has not voiced any
opinion about Trudeau's version of Yale fraternity life. In
Thursday's comic, a character says that Bush ``once presided over
savage initiation rites that included beatings and the searing of
flesh.'' The plot line will continue through Saturday's strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read Trudeau's stuff, and I don't think George does
either,'' said Clay Johnson, who joined the Yale fraternity with
Bush and remains a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the branding story stemmed from an initiation rite
that was intended to frighten pledges. Recruits were shown a
red-hot branding iron and told that they were going to be branded.
Instead, Johnson said, they were touched with a heated clothes
hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a match, lighting it and touching the
blown-out match to your skin. They fake you out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has kept his views about the current Doonesbury
series to himself, it is no secret that he shares his family's low
opinion of the cartoonist. Trudeau provoked the family's ire in
1984 with a cartoon suggesting that then-Vice President Bush had
placed his manhood in a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go up and kick the hell out of him, frankly,'' the
target of the barb admitted later, after he had cooled off. George
W. Bush took his complaints directly to Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all. And I made it
absolutely clear to Mr. Trudeau. And if he didn't like me telling
him that, I don't care,'' a still-seething Bush told an interviewer
a decade after the offending cartoon was published.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for United Features Syndicate, which distributes
Doonesbury, said Trudeau does not give interviews. But the Pulitzer
Prize-winning cartoonist talked about his feud with the Bushes in a
1991 essay in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau chided the Bushes for ``being so prickly,'' suggesting
that if they cannot laugh off his barbs, they should try to ignore
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, it's never personal,'' he wrote. ``At the risk of
sounding like Sonny Corleone, it's my job. I've been doing the same
thing for over 20 years. I was whacking public figures back when
Dan Quayle was still whacking golf balls through law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's career as a cartoonist began during his junior year at
Yale in 1968, the same year George W. Bush graduated. The comic
strip debuted in the Yale Daily News under the name Bull Tales, but
some of the characters have since become nationally known as part
of the Doonesbury cast.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes B.D., a helmet-wearing athlete based on Brian
Dowling, Yale's star quarterback during the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Trudeau's political satire that generates the most
controversy, especially with the Bush family. In addition to
targeting the former president, Trudeau has turned his sharpened
pen on Barbara Bush and three Bush sons, George W., Jeb and Neil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, some Florida papers refused to run a Doonesbury episode
that accused Jeb Bush of trying to block a fraud investigation
involving a business associate. The allegation, which Doonesbury's
distributor later acknowledged was ``misleading,'' was particularly
sensitive because it came during the final days of Jeb Bush's first
campaign for Florida governor. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau says he considers virtually everyone fair game for his
satire, with a few notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever make fun of my wife, Jane Pauley,'' he said in
an Internet question-and-answer feature sponsored by United
Features Syndicate. ``A corollary of that is that I generally stay
away from broadcasters perceived as her direct competitors _ Diane
Sawyer, Barbara Walters, et. al., on the grounds that it would make
it harder for her to maintain a professional collegiality she
greatly values.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Bushes aren't bound by such constraints. Barbara
Bush couldn't resist a shot at Pauley and her husband when she felt
Pauley mistreated her during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a perfect pair,'' she said.

1984 with a cartoon suggesting that then-Vice President Bush had
placed his manhood in a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go up and kick the hell out of him, frankly,'' the
target of the barb admitted later, after he had cooled off. George
W. Bush took his complaints directly to Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all. And I made it
absolutely clear to Mr. Trudeau. And if he didn't like me telling
him that, I don't care,'' a still-seething Bush told an interviewer
a decade after the offending cartoon was published.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for United Features Syndicate, which distributes
Doonesbury, said Trudeau does not give interviews. But the Pulitzer
Prize-winning cartoonist talked about his feud with the Bushes in a
1991 essay in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau chided the Bushes for ``being so prickly,'' suggesting
that if they cannot laugh off his barbs, they should try to ignore
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, it's never personal,'' he wrote. ``At the risk of
sounding like Sonny Corleone, it's my job. I've been doing the same
thing for over 20 years. I was whacking public figures back when
Dan Quayle was still whacking golf balls through law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's career as a cartoonist began during his junior year at
Yale in 1968, the same year George W. Bush graduated. The comic
strip debuted in the Yale Daily News under the name Bull Tales, but
some of the characters have since become nationally known as part
of the Doonesbury cast.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes B.D., a helmet-wearing athlete based on Brian
Dowling, Yale's star quarterback during the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Trudeau's political satire that generates the most
controversy, especially with the Bush family. In addition to
targeting the former president, Trudeau has turned his sharpened
pen on Barbara Bush and three Bush sons, George W., Jeb and Neil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, some Florida papers refused to run a Doonesbury episode
that accused Jeb Bush of trying to block a fraud investigation
involving a business associate. The allegation, which Doonesbury's
distributor later acknowledged was ``misleading,'' was particularly
sensitive because it came during the final days of Jeb Bush's first
campaign for Florida governor. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau says he considers virtually everyone fair game for his
satire, with a few notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever make fun of my wife, Jane Pauley,'' he said in
an Internet question-and-answer feature sponsored by United
Features Syndicate. ``A corollary of that is that I generally stay
away from broadcasters perceived as her direct competitors _ Diane
Sawyer, Barbara Walters, et. al., on the grounds that it would make
it harder for her to maintain a professional collegiality she
greatly values.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Bushes aren't bound by such constraints. Barbara
Bush couldn't resist a shot at Pauley and her husband when she felt
Pauley mistreated her during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a perfect pair,'' she said.

 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The meeting room on lower Broadway was alive with
movie people as the filmmaker Jennie Livingston settled in across
the table from Rudy Tjio, the head of acquisition of Time
Medienvertriebs G.m.b.H., a German film company. Based in Munich,
Tjio had gone to the Independent Feature Film Market, now in
session at the Angelika Film Center and various places around lower
Manhattan, looking for movies to back. Ms. Livingston, director of
the highly acclaimed documentary ``Paris Is Burning,'' had one to
propose.
</P>
<P>
   Noted films like ``Blood Simple,'' ``The Brothers McMullen,''
``Clerks,'' ``My Dinner With Andre,'' ``Roger and Me'' and
``Welcome to the Doll House'' were discovered at the market. So was
``Paris Is Burning.'' Her new film, ``Who's the Top?,'' hasn't been
made yet. Ms. Livingston needs money for that, and on the advice of
her producer, Ruth Charny, she has made a 15-minute clip of the
work in progress and entered it in the market's ``no borders''
program, which allows more experienced filmmakers to meet
representatives of hundreds of movie and television companies that
might finance their work.
</P>
<P>
   No one here needs to be reminded that it is tough to get a deal.
The market directory lists 335 projects _ finished features, works
in progress, shorts, scripts, documentaries _ by 381 filmmakers.
Some are newcomers. Ms. Livingston's reputation is based on one
film, which in the current commercial climate doesn't necessarily
open checkbooks for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, as well known as Ms. Livingston is, ``Paris Is
Burning'' is her only full-length film, and it is a documentary.
``Who's the Top?'' will be her first dramatic feature, a vastly
different proposition. Also, ``Paris Is Burning'' was released in
1991, and at times over the last several years she has been
involved in other fields and didn't promote herself as a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a deal would be nice, but she's not expecting one.
``They could be interested or they could just be tracking you,''
Ms. Livingston, 33, said.
</P>
<P>
   At the market the object of the screenings, meetings and
partying, which began Sept. 17 and ends Friday, usually is more to
make contacts that could pay off in the future. ``I'm really
confident but also really sanguine,'' she said. ``I go my path. If
something happens, something happens. If not, then I've done what I
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris Is Burning,'' about competitions among gay black and
Latino men at drag balls in New York, was shown at the market in
1989 and released commercially in 1991. It made $4 million at the
box office and helped widen opportunities for gay films in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Tjio's company distributed ``Paris Is Burning'' in Germany. But
that takes Ms. Livingston only so far. ``Who's the Top?'' is about
sexual stress in a lesbian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``How important is story?'' Tjio asked Ms. Livingston at their
sit-down. A press release prepared for the market describes ``Who's
the Top?'' as ``the first lesbian S-and-M musical comedy.'' Tjio
had read a synopsis but hadn't seen the clip, which includes an
appearance by Steve Buscemi, who may have a role, and the clip will
be screened at the Angelika. (Videotapes have also been available
in the market library.)
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling being everything to Ms. Livingston, she carefully
explained her film to Tjio. One of the women is fairly
straightforward in her needs, while the other acts out her kinky
proclivities in dream fantasies staged as musical production
numbers. Ms. Livingston mentioned Federico Fellini's ``8{'' and
Luis Bunuel's ``Belle de Jour'' as kindred films. In the scenes
already made, a bottom is spanked and dancers move to suggestive
lyrics. ``I used to think kinky sex was a cure for capitalism; now
I make whips for a living,'' a woman says.
</P>
<P>
   Tjio wanted to know about the sadomasochism. How much was there?
Ms. Charny, the producer, told him that Ms. Livingston saw
sexuality and eroticism through a particular esthetic sensibility.
``She takes things that are taboo and makes them familiar,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Livingston got straight to the point of the film,
saying, ``They love each other and have to work this out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before her meeting with Tjio, she acknowledged
that movie companies were cautious about sadomasochism but said
that this element did not carry the film. ``It's a story about a
couple of women who don't see eye to eye sexually,'' she said.
``How do you deal with having different sexual inclinations? It's
an adult issue that any person who has been married or in a mature
relationship has encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjio asked about budget. Ms. Livingston said they were planning
on $1.2 million. They have already spent about $30,000 on the clip.
Tjio requested a tape and the script. Did he seem interested?
``Most of these things are long shots,'' Ms. Charny said later.
``They're to establish long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay themes are not the obstacles they once were in raising
money, Ms. Livingston said. ``People are way sophisticated,'' she
added. ``No one's going to be homophobic if they think they can
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Livingston says, there are hurdles for women. ``The
carpet is laid out for a young male with talent,'' she said.
``Blocks are put up for the young female.'' She said, ``For anybody
who's trying to present a point of view that's original or
political or tell a story in an unusual narrative way, it's not
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   All films at the market, from finished features to snippets, are
screened at the Angelika, and Thursday. Ms. Livingston will have
her turn. ``What's so great about having this clip is that you can
like it or not,'' she said. ``The advantage is that I'm not saying,
`Imagine this or imagine that.' I'm saying `You see it. Take it or
leave it. Jump on the bandwagon or don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, a dozen film companies had already requested
meetings with Ms. Livingston and Ms. Charny, including Fine Line,
Miramax, Artisan Entertainment, Fox Searchlight and Film Four from
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some cases people are going to be serious
contenders for paying for this movie,'' Ms. Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The movie companies also feel pressure to identify suitable
projects at the market. ``It's hard to find films that will have a
theatrical life,'' said Peter Broderick, president of Next Wave
Films, a 2-year-old company that is owned by the Independent Film
Channel and backs movies for theatrical distribution. ``When we
find a film like that, we essentially get married to the
filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Will they get hitched to Jennie Livingston? Next Wave, based in
Santa Monica, Calif., has five representatives at the market. All
had seen her clip by the time they gathered with Ms. Livingston and
Ms. Charny on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great at the meeting,'' Broderick said. ``It's a
totally unique clip, very stylishly done, not like any movie I've
seen before. That always gets our attention.'' The sadomasochism
presented no problem. ``Some people felt that `Paris Is Burning'
was shocking,'' he said, ``but it changed the way people thought.
This one will make people think differently about gender issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Money was a problem, however. ``The budget is higher than Next
Wave is ready to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Ms. Livingston, then 22 and a recent graduate of Yale,
arrived with a trailer and a flier for ``Paris Is Burning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a couple of meetings out of it,'' she said. ``It didn't
lead to anything, but it was a good experience to be out there
hustling.''
</P>
<P>
   After finding backing elsewhere, she returned with a complete
film in 1989 and screened it at the Angelika. A run at the Film
Forum led to appearances at the 1990 Sundance and Toronto Film
Festivals. The next year ``Paris Is Burning'' was on many
10-best-film lists.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Ms. Livingston has been working in and around film.
She wrote a script that went unproduced. ``It was a satire,'' she
said. ``We couldn't get the money. It happens to every filmmaker,
the pet project that doesn't get made until 10 years later. That
ate up two or three years in terms of focus.'' Later she made short
films, went to Germany on a grant and lectured at Yale and many
film schools. Now she is writing a documentary for the American
Movie Classics Channel on film fans and the nature of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   For a while she questioned her resolve. ``Is this film stuff,
which is so much about performance and competition, something that
I can keep doing, knowing how difficult it is when you tell stories
people don't necessarily want to hear?'' she said. ``In my time of
searching, I decided, yeah, this is what I want to do.''

   TOBACCO-SUIT (Washington) _ The Justice Department closed the

   TAIWAN-SCENE (Tali, Taiwan) _ This little town in central
Taiwan, near the epicenter of Monday's enormous earthquake, seems
utterly shellshocked by the damage, which killed more than 2,000
people, injured countless others, and destroyed thousands of homes.
In towns throughout central Taiwan, rescue workers tried to save
hundreds of residents trapped in the earthquake's rubble but there
were innumerable sites and the work itself was unavoidably slow and
painstaking. By Seth Faison.

   EDUC-PHILANTHROPY (Undated) _ Long dismissed as the runt in the
family of philanthropy, public schools and their students are
getting fresh attention from a small parade of extremely

with such offerings in an exhibition of cutting-edge British art

 &HT;    U.S. SUES TOBACCO INDUSTRY TO RECOVER HEALTH COSTS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charging cigarette makers with a ``campaign of
fraud and deceit'' stretching back to 1954, the Justice Department
sued the tobacco industry Wednesday for federal health costs
totaling hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokesman said the action was a politically
motivated attempt to raise money through the courts and to sink the
$50 billion cigarette industry. He said it would fight the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not succumb to politically correct extortion. We will
not settle this lawsuit,'' said Greg Little, associate general
counsel for the nation's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris
Inc., of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit should be dismissed, and we believe it will,''
Little told reporters at a press conference to rebut the lawsuit's
allegations. ``We are right on the law, we're right on the facts,
and we fully expect to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton _ who telegraphed the possibility of the
lawsuit last January in his annual State of the Union address _
stayed mostly out of sight Wednesday, nursing a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P>
   Through his press office, Clinton issued a terse statement
supporting the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is taking the right course of action,''
the statement said in part. ``It is time for America's taxpayers to
have their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, made clear that the
administration also plans to press the cigarette industry on
another front: higher cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to push it,'' Lockhart said of a White
House proposal to gradually raise cigarette taxes by up to 50 cents
a pack. ``I think you'll hear more about it in the days to come.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to announce the lawsuit, Attorney General
Janet Reno denied that it had political overtones. She said it was
an effort, ``based on the evidence and the law,'' to recover money
that taxpayers have spent to care for smokers who were lied to for
decades by cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 45 years, the companies that manufacture and sell
tobacco have waged an intentional coordinated campaign of fraud and
deceit,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have conducted themselves without regard to the truth,
without regard to the law, and without regard to the health and
life of the American people,'' said Reno. ``The consequences have
been staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno asserted that 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, each year the federal government alone spends
more than $20 billion in taxpayer money just to treat diseases
caused by cigarettes,'' said Reno. ``Today, on behalf of the
taxpayer, we're asking the tobacco companies to pay their fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court here, names Philip Morris; the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., of
Winston-Salem, N.C.; the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., of
Louisville, Ky.; the Lorillard Tobacco Co., of Greensboro, N.C.;
the Liggett Group, Inc., of Durham, N.C.; the American Tobacco Co.,
of Louisville, Ky., and five other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the companies conspired, beginning with a
1954 meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York, to deceive the
American public over the health risks of smoking, conceal the
addictive qualities of nicotine and target children in their
marketing and advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all relevant respects, defendants acted in concert with
each other in order to further their fraudulent scheme,'' the
Justice Department alleges in its 88-page filing.
</P>
<P>
   In a 43-page appendix to the suit, the Justice Department
alleges 116 separate violations of federal racketeering laws by one
or more of the companies named in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the federal Racketeer Influence and
Corrupt Organizations statute, the United States may force
violators to repay so-called ``ill-gotten profits,'' shown to be
earned as a result of fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal Medicare Care Recovery Act allows the
U.S. government to sue to recover medical costs in cases in which a
third party causes injury or disease to a person and the U.S.
government is authorized by law to pay for the victim's medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was applauded by public health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It once again puts the pressure on the tobacco companies,
first of all, to pay for a greater fraction of the harm that
they've caused,'' said Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Project, which has been advocating legal action
against the cigarette makers since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies that have made hundreds of billions of
dollars over the years in profits, while they were imposing
trillions of dollars of financial costs _ and that's just financial
costs _ on the country,'' said Daynard, a professor of law at
Northeastern University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the case has a sound legal basis,'' said Daynard.
``There's no question the factual predicate is there.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris's lawyer, Little, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Clinton administration of ``blatant'' politics
and said the suit suggests that ``this is an administration that is
trying to run these particular manufacturers out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, Little said, the suit has the potential to leave
the cigarette makers too strapped to pay debts they owe to
individual states under a series of legal settlements reached over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the industry reached a settlement with the
attorneys general from 46 states under which the cigarette makers
would pay an estimated $196 billion between 1998 and 2025. The
money would be shared among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ Florida, Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi _
are to share an estimated $40 billion in industry payments under
separate settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to states are based in large part on the
tobacco-related medical bills paid out by Medicaid, the federal
health insurance program for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said federal programs other than Medicaid _ such as
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly, and
the Department of Veterans Affairs _ have also accrued huge
tobacco-related expenses over the years.
</P>
<P>
   She gave no dollar estimate for those expenses. But Clinton, in
his January speech, said overall federal outlays due to
smoking-related illness and disease totalled in the ``hundreds of
billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the industry agreed to pay an estimated $368.5 billion
over 25 years to the federal government. That proposal collapsed in
Congress, however, after lawmakers sought additional provisions
that the tobacco industry rejected.

DRAMATIZING THE AIDS CRISIS WHEN IT SEEMS PASSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
David Bahr most recently wrote for Arts &AMP; Leisure about the film
``The Acid House.'' 
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, ``Three Thousand Scripts Against a Virus''
ruffled more than a few feathers in France. Begun by the French
government as a screenplay competition to promote AIDS awareness,
the project was intended to produce a series of AIDS-related
public-service shorts for television and movie theaters. Of several
thousand submitted scripts, approximately 30 were made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet hardly any involved gay characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really shocking and absurd,'' says Pierre Salvadori, a
French director and critic of the project who is himself not gay.
``I think one of the films dealt with a bisexual. But for the most
part, they totally ignored a major part of the population that was
sick or infected.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Association of Lesbian and Gay Pride Films, an
activist group, responded by organizing its own screenplay
competition, also financed by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that we should do something to complement the first
project because there was nothing geared to the gay and lesbian
population in the context of AIDS,'' says Pascal Dutertre, the
association's president. The result of their politically charged
labor is ``L'Amour Est a Reinventer'' (``Love Reinvented''), a
series of 10 short films first shown on television and then
released theatrically in France in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to have these films originally shown on French
television _ something organized by the state to sensitize a very
large audience,'' Dutertre says. ``But it was broadcast late in the
evening, so it was pretty much a failure in terms of our original
objective. But theatrically it's been one of the greatest successes
of its type, compared to public service projects like those on
drugs and racism.'' A year after its release, it's still running.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``L'Amour Est a Reinventer,'' which opens in New York on
Friday with two additional shorts _ ``Close To,'' by the American
director David Ottenhouse, and ``Cherish,'' by the Australian
filmmaker Stephen Jones _ is an AIDS-crisis project arriving in
America in a post-crisis climate.
</P>
<P>
   Made in 1996, the French films were in production just as
protease inhibitors, the powerful combination of drug therapies,
came into use. Since then, AIDS-related deaths have declined
significantly, and gay writers like Andrew Sullivan and Dan Savage
have even proclaimed that the health crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Castle, the co-president of Jour de Fete Films, the American
distributor of ``L'Amour Est a Reinventer,'' acknowledges that
movies about AIDS seem increasingly passe. ``Obviously the days of
`Longtime Companion' are over,'' he says, referring to the 1990
drama about a group of dying HIV-infected gay men. ``And no one is
making those films anymore anyway. ``There's so much optimism now
in terms of people getting better that the last thing people want
to be reminded of is that you die from it and people still die from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castle believes that ``L'Amour Est a Reinventer'' remains
relevant, both as a work of activism and as an auteur showcase.
``Many of the films are exceptionally strong,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dutertre agrees: ``Of course, in terms of drug treatments, these
films are a bit old. But in terms of the gay community and the
artistic quality of the films, they remain interesting and
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most effective shorts are Jean-Claude Guiguet's ``Une
Nuit Ordinaire'' (``An Ordinary Night''), about a man who visits
his lover in the hospital; Salvadori's ``Un Moment'' (``One
Moment''), about a couple who engage in unsafe sex in the heat of
passion, and Anne Fountaine's ``Tapin du Soi'' (``Night Hustler''),
about a condom-toting male prostitute looking for affection.
</P>
<P>
   These succeed not because of any message but because of their
skillfully rendered narratives. In fact, with ``Une Nuit
Ordinaire,'' one of the project's more affecting works, AIDS takes
a back seat to the film's prime focus: the tender, erotic love
shared by two men.

 UNDATED: two men.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We worked on the screenplay and made the story about an
amorous relationship that went beyond sex,'' says Guiguet. His
short shows a young man on a bicycle on his way to make love to his
partner in the hospital while singing to a recording of ``J'ai
Rendez-Vous Avec Vous'' (``I Have a Date With You'') by the postwar
chanteuse Patachou.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to conjure death while it was imminent,'' Guiguet
says, ``but to push back the inevitable by a few hours, showing how
love and desire are the only means of staying alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiguet avoids making any explicit references to AIDS and death
in his film, a choice, he believes, that allows the film to
transcend time and place. ``The film was completed in 1996,'' he
says. ``The therapies had just come out, and no one yet knew if
they were going to work. But because there are no rules about
healing, I left it open in my film.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly universal, Salvadori's ``Un Moment,'' shot from the
perspective of an unseen protagonist who engages in unprotected sex
with a younger man, raises the issue of condom-use fatigue. ``It
shows a moment of passionate merging and loss of responsibility,''
says Salvadori, ``which is followed by isolation and fear. After
the sex, the boy turns his back on the man, leaving him to himself.
It's absolutely unsentimental. Both heterosexual and homosexual
audiences have responded to it because there is an immediate
identification with what happens. It shows something very human.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally 56 minutes long, ``L'Amour Est a Reinventer'' was
extended to 72 minutes with the two extra shorts, making it long
enough for an American release. The first of the two, ``Close To,''
is based on excerpts from David Wojnarowicz's book ``Memories That
Smell Like Gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, about a young man who has anonymous sex with a
deaf-mute pickpocket, was screened at the Cannes and Toronto film
festivals. The closing film, ``Cherish,'' which opened at the 1998
Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in San Francisco, concerns a white
Australian mourning the death of his Aboriginal lover. Although
neither film originated with the French project, they were chosen
by Jour de Fete for their related themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection shows the whole range of what happens with
HIV,'' explains Castle. ```Close To' reveals the dangerous elements
of anonymous sex, while `Cherish' shows the aftermath, how one
carries on with the spirit of a person lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jones, who at 35 has lost several friends to the disease,
there was a particular pertinence to his film's being included in
the program. ``I was motivated by an awareness that a lot of people
haven't actually dealt with their grief in the gay community,'' he
says. ``In making `Cherish,' it was important for me to do
something useful with my grief and to tell my generation's stories
to younger people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who wrote ``Cherish'' with the Aboriginal poet Romaine
Moreton, hopes his film encourages others to tell their histories.
He feels that many important films about AIDS have yet to be made.
``I think there is a need to look beyond the western world,'' he
says. ``Those are the people now most in need of help and having
their stories heard.''

TOP TOYS FOR THIS CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Couldn't find a Furby in December for your
child's stocking? Didn't even catch a whisper of Talking Elmo the
previous winter? Worried that this holiday season will come and go
and you'll still be searching for the hottest toys?
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret, frazzled parent. An expert on toy trends - and
father of three daughters himself - is letting people know three
months before the holiday season what this winter's hot toys will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Silver, head of the industry publication Toy Book, will
release a holiday-season crib sheet for anxious parents later this
week, dubbed the Toy Wishes catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the stress of looking for the right toy during
holiday shopping season can rival an IRS audit,'' said Silver, who
is co-publisher of the $5, 232-page catalog. ``Our idea is that
this will get parents and children on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it will be several more weeks before many of the
hottest toys are available, Silver believes there's one key word
for parents to remember: electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Talking toys with computer chips are expected to drive 1999's
holiday toy buying past last year's $22 billion domestic take. The
key ``I want it'' group is likely to be children between 8 and 12
years old - that tough-to-please category of miniconsumers who have
been more interested in Game Boys than board games the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this could be the year that the industry will bring
back a lot of the older kids, 8 years old and above, that had gone
away in the last few years toward electronic games,'' Silver said.
``They've gotten a big share back so this year will definitely be
better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy analyst Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison said toy
producers have been forced to re-define their marketing to adjust
to how older children have changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional toy companies are waking up to the fact that kids
have been spending a lot more on electronic games - computer, video
and online - and they're going after this group,'' McGowan said.
``Toy companies still have the distribution, ad dollars and
licenses, so now they have to put that kind of product out there
for that group. My daughter, who's 13, has not had a Barbie since
she was 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Sliver's list of the ``Hot Dozen'' toys is heavily weighted
toward electronic gizmos; only two of the 12 - Pokemon Fossil Cards
and Pokemon Pikachu Plush - fall into more traditional
nonelectronic categories.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the other toys on the catalog's ``hot dozen'' list can
talk and most are highly recognizable entries: Working Woman
Barbie, Interactive Yoda and Toy Story 2 Flight Control Buzz
Lightyear, among them. The quartet of WCW Tuff Talkin' Wrestlers -
Goldberg, Sting, Diamond Dallas and Kevin Nash - have infrared
sensors that recognize each other (``Goldberg, you're not gonna
slam me.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rock and Roll Elmo can sing two songs (``ABC'' and ``Shake,
Rattle and Roll''); Jakks Pacific's WWF Net Wired Stone Cold Steven
Austin delivers daily commentary from the WWF Web site; and the
Intel Play QX3 Computer Microscope operates while hooked up to a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Silver stresses the ``hot dozen'' do not necessarily
representthe most entertaining toys but simply the ones that are
going to be hardest to find, much like Tickle Me Elmo in 1997 and
last year's Furby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some great toys that are not on the `hot dozen'
list,'' he added. ``The ones we've named are the ones that are
mostly likely to generate the biggest demand. If you try to get one
of them at a store after Dec. 15, you probably won't be able to
find them.''
</P>
<P>
   What toys will be the hottest of the hot? Silver said there are
five of the 12 that could be especially difficult:
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon fossil cards, which will be a complete new set
complementing the widely sought collector cards that have become
the must-have item for the 8- to 12-year-old set. ``Pokemon is so
big right now in schools and the Pokemon movie will be out in
November, so these will be very hard to get,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Yoda, which will speak lines from the ``Star Wars''
movies on how to become a Jedi Knight, is certain to draw young
boys and collectors. ``This one is a no-brainer,'' Silver said.
``It's going to be scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock and Roll Elmo, successor to 1997's super-hot Tickle Me
Elmo.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Story 2 Flight Control Buzz, which will receive a boost from
Disney's much-admired marketing machine and the hype surrounding
the Nov. 24 release of the sequel. The toy, likely to hit shelves
in late October or early November, was previously called Smart
Flying Buzz and has been re-named several times.

 &HT;    GROUP SAYS ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OFTEN INCREASE TRAFFIC
CONGESTION
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creeping along through road construction projects
is worth the hassle once they're completed, right? Not necessarily,
according to a new study being released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Construction delays often cost drivers more time in the long
run, say officials at the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
private group that commissioned the study.
</P>
<P>
   Using figures provided by state transportation departments and
selected case studies, the group concluded that new, improved roads
rarely result in easier commutes.
</P>
<P>
   Results indicate that road expansion projects ``often deliver
scant time savings to people who use the road everyday, while
allowing and even stimulating significantly more traffic once the
construction project is completed,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, most communities haven't adequately discussed the
costs and benefits per individual driver, said Barbara McCann, a
spokesperson for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most planning is done by engineers who focus on traffic flow,
average daily traffic and level of service, which doesn't address
the concerns of individuals and quality of life issues,'' McCann
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCann said that while easing traffic congestion is often given
as the reason for road expansion projects, they don't always result
in faster commutes. Once the projects are completed, they can end
up luring more cars on the road, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the new road has done is bought a few years of time,''
McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   The project team recommended that transportation officials
solicit more public comment about alternatives to construction
projects. They also urged that officials place a higher priority on
reconfiguring roads to reduce construction delays and that they
explore other ways to relieve congestion during construction
projects. Road expansion projects should not be undertaken until
officials consider the impact of construction delays and increased
travel, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some transportation officials questioned whether the
group could authoritatively speak on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a self-appointed transportation planning group
in Washington, D.C., that's telling local governments how to
address their transportation issues,'' said Matthew Jeanneret, a
spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders
Association. ``Road construction projects are not a haphazard
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing for public comment and participation,
Jeanneret said road construction projects must also adhere to state
and local regulations, as well as environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanneret said the group's goal appears to be delaying
transportation projects, which he said is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kills,'' he said. ``The (U.S.) Department of
Transportation estimates that poor and obsolete roads result in
12,000 deaths each year. By delaying them, you run the risk of
prolonging unsafe roads and having worse congestion and
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the study ``a slap in the face'' to local communities
and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know best what their needs are and how to evaluate
them,'' Jeanneret said.

LULAC URGES HISPANIC PARENTS TO TURN OFF TV AS WAY OF HELPING
SCHOOLCHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hispanic schoolchildren spend too much time
watching television and not enough time doing homework, a Hispanic
civil rights group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So the League of United Latin American Citizens is encouraging
Hispanic parents to turn off the television, especially during
hours children should be doing homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that Hispanic parents and Texas schools change their
habits,'' said Linda Chavez, LULAC's regional director from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The turn-off-the-tube effort is the first component of an
education plan that LULAC plans to introduce by the end of the
year. Its education efforts will focus on improving Hispanic
children's performance in Texas schools, and the group's main
thrust will involve bilingual programs in Texas schools and school
dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   LULAC offered no specifics on how it might address its concerns
with bilingual education or dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Gamboa, LULAC's Waco director, said the
education establishment has failed to deal with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa said LULAC will form a task force of Hispanic groups and
legislative leaders to address school &UR;  &LR; dropout concerns.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He called the dropout rate ``extremely tragic. We've had any
number of years in allowing the public school system of the state
of Texas to make an effort to address the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Texas Education Agency in the past has obscured the
dropout problem by categorizing children who leave school in a
variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander earlier this week
announced the formation of a Public Education Integrity Task Force
to study, among other things, what she termed ``bogus dropout
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   LULAC's call for Hispanic parents to get their children to spend
more time doing homework and less time glued to the television
comes during a 10-day boycott of major television networks. The
boycott was initiated by the NAACP and the National Council of La
Raza and is supported by LULAC. Dubbed a ``brownout'' by Hispanics,
the boycott started Sept. 15 in Houston and extends through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuously portrayed in negative roles (on
television) _ that is when we do have roles,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   LULAC and other organizations criticized the season premier of
NBC-TV's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' in which a white character referred to a
Hispanic maid in a racially derogatory manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime time television not only robs our children of valuable
study time, but it also erodes their positive sense of identity,''
Chavez added.
</P>
<P>
   However, LULAC representatives didn't offer specific suggestions
on how many hours a day children should be allowed to watch
television, saying that decision should be made by each family.
</P>
<P>
   A survey earlier this year by Nielsen Media Research found that
American teen-agers spend, on average, 3 hours a day watching TV,
and children ages 2 to 11 spend about 7 1/2 hours a day viewing
television.
</P>
<P>
   Another study conducted in 1998 by the University of Michigan's
Institute for Social Research found that overall, children average
about 90 minutes in front of the television on weekdays. But that
study concluded TV time occupied far more of a child's time than
schoolwork or reading.

   &UR; LOVE AT HIGH SPEED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Your Honor, my wife is just being ridiculous. Most women would
love to have a husband who still believes in chivalry and I was
only opening the door for her out of chivalry.`
</P>
<P>
   `Mr. Smith,' replied the judge, `I am granting the divorce. I
cannot believe chivalry was your motivation while driving 65 mph.'

   &UR; ANIMAL RIGHTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A guy comes walking into a bar with a little turtle in his hand.
The turtle's one eye is black and blue, two of his legs are
bandaged, and his whole shell is taped together with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender asks the man, `What's wrong with your turtle?'
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing,` the man responds, `This turtle is very fast. Take
your dog and let him stand at the end of the bar. Then go and stand
at the other end of the room and call your dog. I'll bet you $500
that before your dog reaches you, my turtle will be there.`
</P>
<P>
   So the bartender, thinking it's an easy $500, agrees. He goes to
the other side of the bar, and on the count of three calls his dog.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the guy picks up his turtle and throws it across the
room, narrowly missing the bartender, and smashing into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   `Told you it'll be there before your dog.`

   &UR; WHAT'S MY NAME? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly ladies were enjoying the sunshine on a park bench in
Miami. They had been meeting in that park every sunny day, for 12
years...chatting and enjoying each others friendship.
</P>
<P>
   One day one of the ladies, turns to the other and says, `Please
don't be angry with me, dear, but I am embarrassed, after all these
years... What is your name? I am trying to remember, but I just
can't.`
</P>
<P>
   The friend stares at her, looking very distressed, says nothing
for two full minutes, and finally with tearful eyes, says `How soon
do you have to know?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THESE KIDS TODAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers in a small town were well-known as trouble makers.
If there was a problem in town, these boys were guaranteed to be
there. Their parents finally decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   They called on the priest. He was known to have success in
dealing with problematic behavior. He agreed to see them, but only
one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother went first. He walked in and the priest
asked him, `Where is God?` in a mild voice.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother just sat there. The priest asked again,
`Where's God?` The boy again just sat there.
</P>
<P>
   The priest tried once more, in a very annoyed and angered voice,
`Tell me son, WHERE IS GOD?'
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, the boy ran out of the room and straight to his room
at home, where he hid under the bed. His older brother came in and
asked what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The younger boy said, `We are in big trouble this time.
</P>
<P>
   God is missing, and they think we did it!'

<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis J. Zucker of Belmont, Mass., a noted physicist and
philosopher, died Friday at his home. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Vienna, Mr. Zucker came to the United States in 1938
and received a bachelor's degree in physics from Columbia
University in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he taught physics to Air Force cadets at
Hamilton College in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   He received a master's degree from Harvard University in 1946
and joined the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory, where he
worked in electromagnetic theory, focusing on antenna theory and
surface waves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Mr. Zucker's interest in the philosophy of science took
him to Germany to study with renowned physicist and science
philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined the Planck Institute near Munich until 1978, when
he returned to Boston to rejoin the Air Force laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A mainstay of the Boston Colloquium at Boston University, Mr.
Zucker was also the author of articles on applied physics and on
the philosophy of science. With Robert E. Collins, he co-edited the
two-volume ``Antenna Handbook,'' considered the definitive work in
the antenna field.
</P>
<P>
   He also translated von Weizsaecker's book ``The Unity of
Nature'' into English and co-edited a collection of essays,
``Goethe and the Sciences, A Reappraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Zucker leaves his wife, Ilona K. of Belmont; and a sister,
Lily Munford of Pleasantville, N.Y.

NEW ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER TOURS WWII DEATH CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When he campaigned for chancellor last year, Gerhard
Schroeder suggested that Germany had to move beyond its past, to
stop wallowing in the guilt felt over what happened in Germany
under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, as he accompanied Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak around what used to be the Sachsenhausen concentration camp,
the German chancellor acknowledged there was no letting go of a
legacy that includes the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way to deal with this unimaginable crime. We
must remind ourselves and everyone else of it again and again,''
Schroeder said. ``There must never be another Sachsenhausen,
another Auschwitz, another Treblinka, in any place on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by their wives and three survivors of Sachsenhausen
who now live in Israel, the two leaders entered the camp by passing
through a black wrought iron gate with the Nazi admonition that
``Work Will Set You Free.'' In fact, it killed about half the
200,000 slave laborers who were interned in Sachsenhausen between
1936 and 1945, about 10 percent of them Jewish. Some were murdered,
others literally worked to death.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barak, Schroeder wore a skull cap, and both men laid
wreaths to commemorate the victims. While Schroeder said Germans
should never forget what happened at Sachsenhausen, Barak, Israel's
most decorated soldier, said Jews would never allow themselves to
be in such a position again. Among those listening were two
grandchildren of Sachsenhausen survivors who now serve in the
Israeli Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never will we leave ourselves without the means to defend our
lives or at the mercy of other peoples,'' said Barak. ``We will
always defend ourselves and every Jew, wherever they may be. We
swear that as long as we can still draw breath, there will be never
be another Auschwitz, no Jews on death marches to the gas chambers,
no mass graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yirak Bahir, 76, was the only member of his family to survive
Sachsenhausen. A Polish Jew now living in Israel, he brought his
grandson along and reflected on how he survived when so many did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either an accident or a miracle, but in any case it
wasn't any thanks to God, because God wasn't here,'' Bahir said.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Barak seemed equally anxious to have the Israeli
leader be the first foreign head of state to visit Berlin since the
city resumed its position as the German capital this month.
</P>
<P>
   For Schroeder, it was an important symbolic way of reclaiming
Berlin, the place where the Final Solution was devised. It also
answered critics who say Schroeder is so determined to reposition
Germany as an international power that he shies away from
confronting the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, it was his first visit to continental Europe since
taking office in July. While he offered warm words for the German
democracy that has matured over the last half-century, he also said
Germany had an obligation to be vigilant against the sort of
extremists who torched an exhibit at the camp shortly after one of
his predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin, made an official visit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a duty to crush any'' Nazi ``and anti-Semitic bud,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left Germany Wednesday for Paris, where he and French
officials will meet to map out a way for the resumption of peace
talks between Israel and Syria after a three-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Barak called his visit to the concentration camp ``a moral
necessity,'' and turned down offers to meet with German business
leaders and visit the Reichstag, the newly rechristened home of
German parliament, so he could go to Sachsenhausen.
</P>
<P>
   He and Schroeder urged German businesses to settle compensation
claims filed by those who worked as slave laborers under the Nazi
regime. About 35 German firms have indicated they will contribute
to a compensation fund, but many others want assurances that they
will not be subject to additional claims if they become part of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his wife, Nava, brought along three survivors of
Sachsenhausen, including 82-year-old Eli Carmel, who described his
return to Germany as the end of his exodus.

AREA KIDS' REACTIONS TO FORT WORTH CHURCH KILLINGS

<P>
   When a gunman opened fire in a church in Fort Worth, Texas,
killing seven people before taking his own life, children and
adults in this North Texas community reacted with shock, hurt and
anger. Here, students from local schools share their responses to
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   I just moved here, and we're two blocks away from the church.
And we were at the church last week for a meeting. I was just
floored. I'm probably not going back there ever. I was so freaked
out, I couldn't sleep. I was just scared. There were helicopters
circling all night, police cars, lights. There was commotion until
4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   You hear about Columbine, you hear about Kentucky _ that's
really sad, but it's in another state. But when it's down the
street, it hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   I saw my friend on TV. She was on there crying. They were
putting cameras in people's faces, especially when parents would
find their kids. I think it's insensitive. People want a little
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   A church is a holy place. People let their guards down. They're
praying. That's a place you wouldn't want to have to worry about
getting shot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asha McElfish, 11, home school, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's senseless. I see no reason for this. It's just a
waste. I feel sad about it but I don't feel that disturbed about
it. It's going to happen, and there isn't anything we can do about
it. I like to think they are in a better place now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adam Douglas, 17, high school, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I just think it's sad that you can't even pray without being
interrupted by somebody crazy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Justin Kirby, 12, junior high school, Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably one of the most appalling things I've ever seen. I
really hate to see this happen. You would think you could go to
church and be safe and have sanctuary. This is going to affect a
lot of people for a long time. This is going to scare a lot of
people away from going to church.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evan Sustaire, 15, high school, Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to believe because, after hearing about all these
high school shootings, it's not a shock to hear about shootings at
schools. But at a church _ it's somewhere safe, where people can be
at peace. Now, that's been violated. If you can't be safe at
church, where can you be safe?
</P>
<P>
   The next day at school, people talked about it. They tried to
keep it out of the classroom, but it kind of loomed over the whole
day. I know people who went to see one of the counselors. They
needed to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   _Angelica Lara, 15, high school, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I was just baffled. I was surprised because it was a church, and
there were a bunch of kids in there. I watched the news until it
was time to go to bed because some friends had talked about going
and it was all crazy in the beginning and nobody knew who was safe.
At school today, we spent the whole World Geography period talking
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Shayna Reasoner, 14, high school, Azle, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   You just saw students crying all day. We talked about it in
every class. Our teachers feel it's best to go back to routine.
They said we'll take it slow. There was counseling available
because it was just so close to home. I think people just all
needed to be together.
</P>
<P>
   At my synagogue, after the shootings in Los Angeles, it's kind
of like you're in prison. Doors are locked, there are security
guards. It's just really scary. It makes me feel safer but it
doesn't feel like a religious service anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Illana Stein, 15, high school, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   We have lost that feeling of being safe in school, being safe
when you go outside. But the church was the last place you could
feel safe. I've never felt unsafe going to church. Now that's taken
away from us.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Chapman, 16, high school, Hurst, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I think that these shootings represent a flaw in American
society. This flaw may not be caused by any one thing. It's a
combination of many factors _ guns, bad families, lack of religion,
etc. each contributing equally to the problem. Until America can
come together and take stock of itself and decide what should
happen to get rid of this violence in society, and then act on it,
nothing will change. It's useless to point fingers. We've had
fingerpointing for years. Now we need action.
</P>
<P>
   Thane ``Woody'' Tuttle, 16, private school, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I used to go to that church for about five years, when we lived
in Fort Worth. When I found out I was really upset. Someone was
maybe unhappy about their life and they took it out on them. It was
a real shock. It's devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Lohmer, 16, high school, Meridian, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To me it's just really scary because I also go to a Baptist
church. That Wednesday night service was really a time to reflect
on what we did at See You at the Pole, and people were excited.
Now, Fort Worth is going to be synonymous with this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you come to the realization of `What if this is my last
day? What would I say to my friend if I knew she was going to get
shot dead today?' Things do happen and you can't plan everything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kassi Nopratvarakorn, 16, high school, Keller, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If we're not safe at school, if we're not safe at home because
of the drive-by shootings, and if we're not safe at church, where
are we safe? That's the place where you least expect to be looking
over your shoulder. It is kind of scary to know it could be
anywhere. You never know who could be carrying a gun _ some kid,
some crazy person.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Kellerman, 14, junior high school, Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It's really sad that this stuff has happened so much that I
didn't hear much talk about it at school. It was no surprise. It's
getting to be every other week nowadays. I went home from a
Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting and the TV was on. I just
turned the TV off. It is just depressing. It's not even a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Luper, 17, high school, Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   I was in our own church rally at the time I heard about it, and
it scared me. I think everyone in the auditorium tensed up, and
every noise we heard, we looked behind us to make sure it wasn't a
gunshot. I was angry that some man had the nerve to go into a
church and display his hatred and anger. It gives me a sense of
peace about the situation because they were in the House of God,
and I know God was watching over everyone and is taking care of the
ones that are now with him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shelley Nelson, 15, high school, Denton, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's sad that this is what the world has come to today.
I think it's devastating when such innocent people die. When the
shooting happened in Colorado, I know I thought, `How sad,' but it
really didn't hit me. To know this happened just 45 minutes away
really hits me at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jordan Wohlgemuth, 17, High School, Denton
</P>
<P>
   Fifth grade students at Greenbriar Elementary School, in Fort
Worth, wrote essays on their feelings about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very sorry for the people at Wedgwood Baptist Church. I
hope our school doesn't have a shooting because this world is just
getting worse. I wish guns weren't invented because they are
tragic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy McGee.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very sad for that church because that could have been my
church and I could have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mikael Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Where was God that night?
</P>
<P>
   _ Abraham Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about the shooting at the church I was
shocked. There were several people killed because of one man's
anger. Now I am scared. I wonder if that will happen to me. I am
sad because my baby sitter's best friend and other people were
killed in that tragedy. One question keeps going through my mind:
Why?
</P>
<P>
   _ Cayce Oswalt.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for the families of the victims. It was a real
tragedy. Hopefully, that man was a Christian and just had the devil
in him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Megan McCuller.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing in the news what happened at the Wedgwood Baptist
Church, I was very sad for all the people that were in the church
when this happened. Many children were there. Some of my friends
were there. God bless everybody.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gustavo Perez.
</P>
<P>
   My sister's friend died that night and he wasn't even 20. When I
found out about what happened I started to cry. I miss him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Graham.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for the people who died that were in the church.
And I feel sorry because the people that died had more time to
live. And why would somebody kill in the house of Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ramiro Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that the Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting was not fair
at all. My family members' friends died in this tragic shooting.
Wedgwood School members were bawling over lost family.
</P>
<P>
   _ Markus Viramontes.
</P>
<P>
   This really affected me, because it is a rare possibility that a
thing like this could happen in a church. My opinion of this
terrible incident is that it was an ignorant act. It is cruel to
take someone's life and then take your own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Branda Williams.
</P>
<P>
   When I discovered the dreadful news that Wedgwood Baptist Church
had experienced a dreadful shooting massacre, I was in complete
devastation. Some of my fellow neighbors had been at the church on
the day of the shooting. One of them was a horsehair from being
shot, and another one got shattered by glass as the pipe bomb went
off. The gunman had absolutely no right to interrupt a prayer
meeting and concert to kill people because of his own emotions and
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   My heart was crying out to those emotionally and physically
hurt. To those who were not there and to those who were, now is a
time of hope and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Justin Groth.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was a tragic moment for everyone. It also made me
mad, upset and angry. This was the worst moment of my life, because
I have friends who go to that church, but they did not attend the
evening of the killings. Thank heavens! I was thankful that he did
not demolish the church, and I'm glad the policemen got there
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brandon Sims.
</P>
<P>
   My mom explained to me that bad things can happen anywhere, and
from her verbal lesson, I learned to be prepared for anything that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tori Whitmore.
</P>
<P>
   This bothered me terribly. I felt sorry for everyone who was
shot, even the murderer. I just couldn't believe this abominable
attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corben Henry.
</P>
<P>
   This tragedy has affected kids like you all over the country. If
you want to share your own feelings about the Wedgwood shooting,

THE GUN CONTROL ISSUE 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights.

<P>
   GUN CONTROL STATISTICS
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, firearms killed 32,436 people in the United States,
according to the most recent statistics from the national Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Every day in America, 15 children are killed with firearms,
according to a 1996 Children's Defense Fund report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 361 children in Texas died as a result of firearms,
according to Handgun Control Inc., a nonpartisan organization that
lobbies in favor of gun regulations at the state and national
level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Texas hosted 472 gun shows, far more than any other
state in the nation, according to Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms account for 27 percent of the 20,000 fatal injuries
each year to children ages 1-19, according to a 1996 Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health Injury Prevention Center report.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that having a gun at home increases by
tenfold the risk that a teen-ager may commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A September poll by The Washington Post and ABC News found that
63 percent of Americans want stricter gun control laws, 77 percent
want to ban the sale of assault weapons, 49 percent want to ban
people from carrying concealed weapons, and 32 percent want a
nationwide ban on the sale of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THE ISSUE?
</P>
<P>
   The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791,
begins, ``A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security
of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms
shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Americans have increasingly questioned how that
amendment ought to be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun-rights advocates argue that it means exactly what it
says: Citizens have a right to bear arms, without interference from
the government. Some gun-control supporters say the amendment is
outdated because it was written when the country called upon
private citizens to protect its interests. Those citizens, of
course, would need to be armed.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of opinions that fall between those two opposing
viewpoints. Violence in the media, poor parenting, and cultural
attitudes all have been blamed for rampant gun violence in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, guns-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association
insist that simply enforcing the gun-control laws already on the
books will lower the chances that guns fall into the wrong hands.
They argue that law-abiding gun owners are unjustly penalized by
more restrictions, and that gun-owning citizens can actually thwart
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of stricter gun control believe that only new laws
will reduce deaths and injuries by firearms. They endorse measures
such as waiting periods, background checks, requiring manufacturers
to add safety locks to guns and raising the age limit at which
people can buy guns. Gun control advocates point to countries like
Japan and England, where owning guns is highly regulated or
illegal, and gun crimes are almost unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the first major gun control legislation in 1968,
in the wake of the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Sen. Robert Kennedy. It prohibited certain people, such as
convicted felons, from buying guns; set standards for gun dealers;
and placed other restrictions on the sale and use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1994, the federal Brady law took effect. The law is
named for James Brady, White House press secretary under President
Ronald Reagan who was shot in the head and partially paralyzed in
1981, during the attempt on Reagan's life. The Brady law
established a waiting period of five business days for those who
want to buy guns and required background checks for people buying
guns through licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the five-day waiting period was replaced with
an ``instant'' check on gun purchasers, which can be done by
computer. Many gun sellers at gun shows are not licensed dealers,
so background checks and waiting periods do not apply to the people
who buy guns from them.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 states still enforce waiting periods on the purchase of
guns and/or permits to buy guns. Texas has no waiting period and
does not require a permit to buy a gun. To carry a concealed weapon
in Texas, you must be over 21 and qualify for a state license. But
it's illegal to carry guns into ``a place of worship'' if such a
place posts a sign that handguns are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE DO THE POLITICIANS STAND?
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton favors strengthening the country's
gun-control laws, including restricting gun buyers from purchasing
more than one handgun a month. He recently announced a federal plan
to buy guns from their owners, estimating that the program could
bring in 300,000 weapons. But the push to increase national
gun-control laws since the April shootings at Columbine High School
has been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the U.S. Senate passed a gun-control bill that would
have required a three-day waiting period and background check for
people buying guns at gun shows. The House of Representatives
proposed shrinking the waiting period from three days to 24 hours,
but the House bill never came to a vote. Senators and
representatives are now trying to devise a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES DONE?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Britain made it illegal for citizens to possess any
handgun larger than a .22 caliber; Ireland has a similar law. In
1996, Australia outlawed semi-automatic weapons and pump-action
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Canada makes gun buyers wait 28 days and submit to a background
check before they can have their weapons. In Japan, only licensed
shooting teams can own handguns. Since 1994, the United States has
banned 19 types of assault weapons.

TEEN-AGE INVENTOR, ALEXANDER RIVES, HAS LOTS OF ENERGY 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 By JESSAMY BROWN, with information from the ``Seattle
Post-Intelligencer'' 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<TEXT>
<P>
   Name: Alexander Rives.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: toy inventor.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies: crew team, photography.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 18.
</P>
<P>
   Current project: creating a volcano toy
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Rives makes sparks fly. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   He is the inventor of The Lightning Machine, a hand-held
miniature lightning maker sold through his parents' toy company,
Scientific Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sold more than 30,000 of the science kits since
April through retail outlets including Discovery Channel and Museum
Company stores. The Lightning Machine, which sells for $19.99 and
looks like a foil-coated plastic tube with two long copper wires
poking out the top, helps kids learn the basics of static
electricity. It's a 21st-century version of the first device used
to store electricity. Invented in the 1740s at the University of
Leyden in the Netherlands, that gadget was called a Leyden jar.
</P>
<P>
   To make sparks fly, the toy is run across a television screen to
collect electrons, and then the two balls on the top are touched
together to create an electrical arch.
</P>
<P>
   Inventing the toy was pretty easy, Alexander says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have much homework one week,'' he says, ``and it
just sort of happened.''
</P>
<P>
   His newest project, a toy volcano, also seems to have just sort
of happened. This summer, as a volunteer, Alexander went to Iceland
to investigate the interaction between glaciers and the island's
volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Although science is one of Alexander's better subjects at the
private school he attends in Seattle, it's not his favorite
subject. He wouldn't divulge his cumulative grade-point average but
admitted it was close to a 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't exploring science and inventing toys, he's
probably at his computer. Alexander is a computer arts whiz and has
a Web site called Beyond Reality that shows off some of his work.
(www.halcyon.com/alrives/).
</P>
<P>
   He also runs his own Internet business, offering tips to others
interested in computer-generated graphics.

SENATOR ACCUSES CLINTON OF POLITICS IN VIEQUES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., accused President
Clinton Wednesday of preparing to close a 58-year-old target range
on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques in order to cultivate
Hispanic political support for the prospective New York Senate
campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee's panel
on military readiness, released a handwritten note from the
president to national security adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger
dated July 26 in which Clinton said it would be ``wrong'' for the
Navy to resume combat training with live munitions on the Caribbean
island with 9,300 civilian residents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is awaiting recommendations from the Pentagon on the
future use of the Vieques target range, shut down since April when
a Marine pilot mistakenly bombed the range observation post,
killing a civilian Puerto Rican security guard and injuring four
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I fear that a decision will be made on politics
rather than national security,'' Inhofe said at the outset of
Senate and House hearings into the politically explosive stalemate
that pits the government of Puerto Rico against the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that this administration may take action that
will place at risk the lives of sailors and Marines simply to court
the popular vote in favor of candidates with close ties to this
president,'' Inhofe said. He also accused the president of seeking
to build Hispanic political support for the campaign of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lawmaker, citing Clinton's clemency for
imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists last month, condemned what he
said was the chief executive's willingness ``to place American
lives and interests at risk in order to garner votes for his
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are a powerful political force in New York, where Mrs.
Clinton is weighing a campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. Hispanics also represent an influential
political constituency in electorally important states such as
California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois that would be
crucial to Gore's political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   James Fallin, an assistant White House press secretary and a
spokesman for the National Security Council, called Inhofe's
allegations ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallin added: ``To leap from the hand-written remarks to a
conclusion that the president has made up his mind or that the
president is politically motivated is both unreasonable and without
basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House official said Clinton's note to Berger was in
response to a ``compelling'' letter from Puerto Rico Sen. Ruben
Barrios appealing to the White House to order Navy withdrawal from
the island, where 9,300 civilians live.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Sun, which first reported Clinton's note in a
story published Wednesday, said Clinton's note was in response to a
July 21 letter from Barrios in which the Puerto Rican activist, a
fellow graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School, told
Clinton that Puerto Ricans are ``forced to live under constant
threat to their lives in a narrow strip of land'' sandwiched
between Navy-owned property on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy, I agree with this,'' Clinton wrote Berger. ``This is
wrong. I think they don't want us there. That's the main point. The
Navy can find a way to work around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., challenged Inhofe's remarks,
calling on members of Congress to ``judge the issue on the merits
and not inject a shoddy type of politics into it.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these related developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Representatives of more than 30 Hispanic and civil rights
organizations joined six Hispanic members of Congress, including
Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., to demand a permanent end to Navy
operations on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to free the people of Vieques from the military
occupation of their home,'' said Rep. Nydia Velasquez, D-N.Y.,
adding: ``When you violate the civil rights of the Puerto Rican
community, the entire (Hispanic) community is united behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Members of Congress joined Navy Vice Adm. William J. Fallon
and Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace to appeal to Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello to open negotiations on a compromise solution. Rossello,
insisting the Navy must withdraw from Vieques, ruled out compromise
during a visit to Capitol Hill last week.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage negotiations, Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., announced that he has asked the Senate
leadership to reserve $27 million to provide economic assistance to
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fallon, commander of the Atlantic fleet, and Pace outlined
proposed Navy concessions, including reduced training operations
from 180 days a year to 120 days a year; cutting the number of
rounds from warships' 5-inch guns by 50 percent to roughly 100
rounds per vessel; and returning to Puerto Rican authorities an
8,000-acre ammunition storage site at the western end of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a solution here,'' Pace told Congress. ``We can sit
down and accommodate the legitimate needs of the citizens of
Vieques and the needs of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The military leaders warned that the combat readiness of
departing aircraft carrier battle groups would continue to
deteriorate without immediate resumption of integrated sea, land
and air combat rehearsals on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The armada centered around the aircraft carrier USS John F.
Kennedy that is en route to the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf
includes only one ship, the destroyer USS John Hancock, that lacks
required qualification for gunfire support with its 5-inch guns,
according to the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But five of the six surface warships accompanying the aircraft
carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in February will fall short of
required qualification for gunfire support, a Navy officer warned,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As Fallon put it: ``We're seeing for the first time the
implications of not being able to use this range on Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton awaits recommendations on the future of Vieques and
alternatives to the site from a four-member Pentagon review panel
that was appointed at his request in June.

CISCO SYSTEMS BUYING WEBLINE COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc. plans to buy closely held WebLine
Communications Corp. of Burlington, Mass. for $325 million in
stock, the latest buyout of a Bay State start-up by one of the
technology sector's giants.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996 by two graduate students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, WebLine makes software to help companies
like Fidelity Investments and retailer Lands' End manage their
e-mail, develop their Web sites, and provide other communications
services.
</P>
<P>
   Now WebLine and its 120 employees will be merged into a Cisco
software unit based in Lowell, Mass. Headquartered in San Jose,
Calif., networking-gear maker Cisco has about 1,200 employees in
the Bay State and plans to employ as many as 5,000 workers here
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price represents a return nearly 12 times greater
than the $28 million in financing WebLine has raised from firms
including Highland Capital Partners, Advent International,
Information Technology Ventures, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. and MCI Worldcom Inc. also hold significant stakes,
though WebLine declined to break down specific ownership or to
disclose its revenue or whether it is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Like other electronic-commerce companies, WebLine had been
considering an initial public offering of stock, but decided a sale
would give it faster access to more people to sell and distribute
its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way to grow quickly enough to meet the market
demand,'' WebLine chief executive Dan Keshian said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are expected as a result of the deal, said John
Thibault, Cisco senior vice president. Thibault said the purchase
will complement Cisco's acquisition in April of GeoTel
Communications Corp. for $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That deal came amid a string of acquisitions of local technology
companies; another major acquirer was Lucent Technologies, which
has purchased six Massachusetts companies this year, the latest
being Excel Switching Corp. of Hyannis, which agreed to be bought
in August for $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco expects to continue its acquisition spree and reiterated
its plans to build a large central campus somewhere in
Massachusetts soon, Thibault said.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the agreement call for Cisco to issue stock worth
$325 million to the local company's various equity holders, with
the exact number of shares exchanged to be determined at a later
date. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries will include WebLine's two founders, Firdaus
Bhathena and Pasha Roberts, who met in an entrepreneurship course
at MIT and won the school's $50K business plan competition in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bhathena, 29, earned a master's degree in computer science from
MIT and is WebLine's product vice president. Roberts, 37, completed
a year of MIT's Sloan School of Management before leaving to join
WebLine; he now works as a specialist for computer telephony.

BAURY TO FIELD FLAT-TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gary Bauer, the Republican presidential candidate
known for his ties to religious conservatives and for his strong
opposition to abortion, plans Thursday to open a new front in his
campaign by unveiling a flat-tax plan that rivals the one put
forward by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, in calling for a 16 percent flat tax and a 20 percent cut
in Social Security taxes, is hoping to attract voters in places
such as the first-primary state of New Hampshire, where economic
issues traditionally are more important than social matters.
Bauer's strength so far has been in Iowa, the first caucus state.
He came in fourth in the August straw poll there, apparently by
stressing his antiabortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a full-scale, well-stated economic agenda to compete
in more secular states in the primaries,'' said Jeffrey Bell, a
senior consultant for Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some enthusiasm for him in Iowa and in some Southern
states, Bauer has failed to make much headway nationally. He was
backed by just 3 percent of likely Republican voters in a New
Hampshire poll conducted by The Boston Globe from Aug. 27 to 31.
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer has mentioned elements of the plan and has posted an
outline on his Web site, Thursday's address at the National Press
Club here will mark the first time he will devote a full speech to
the issue, according to aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total federal tax bite is bigger today than when our
fathers and grandfathers marched off to defend freedom in World War
II,'' Bauer said in an advance text. ``In the Bible, God only asks
for a tithe, one-tenth. And feudal lords were prohibited from
confiscating more than a third of their serfs' crops. Yet today the
tax burden on the typical working family exceeds even what humble
serfs were required to pay the robber barons of the Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's aides said his plan is designed to be more beneficial to
lower-income people than the Forbes plan. Bauer, for instance,
specifically retains the Earned Income Tax Credit, which reimburses
qualified lower-income people for certain income taxes. Forbes has
said the status of the tax credit will be determined as part of a
welfare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Several other candidates have put forward tax plans, including
former Vice President Dan Quayle, who has proposed a 30 percent tax
cut. The Republican front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, so
far has said only that he wants to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   These are the highlights of Bauer's plan:
</P>
<P>
   --Individuals and businesses would pay a 16 percent flat tax,
compared with the 17 percent plan proposed by Forbes. While most
deductions would be eliminated, the deduction for charitable
contributions would be retained. The deduction for existing home
mortgage interest would be allowed. However, the plan assumes that
rates on new mortgages would drop because lenders would not have to
pay taxes on their interest income.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have criticized the flat tax because they think it
would create a budget deficit. But aides portray the Bauer plan as
``revenue neutral'' because it would increase certain investment
taxes on businesses to make up for the cut in personal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   --The Social Security payroll tax would be cut by 20 percent,
with individuals allowed to use the savings any way they want. As a
result, Social Security benefits would be cut by a roughly
corresponding amount, Bell said. Social Security taxes might
``ratchet up'' at a modest rate in 10 to 20 years, he said. ``We
are trying to be honest about the costs as well as the benefits,''
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   --Capital gains would be taxed at 16 percent, down from the
current 20 percent. The ``death tax,'' or estate tax, would be
abolished.

RESEARCHERS DISCOVER POSSIBLE MUSCLE-RESTORATION TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A surprising finding by researchers at
Children's Hospital suggests that bone marrow transplants might be
a new strategy for restoring strength to patients with muscular
dystrophy and other muscle-wasting diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary experiments, the scientists infused mice weakened
by muscular dystrophy with special bone marrow stem cells taken
from healthy donor mice.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the stem cells generated new bone marrow and blood
cells in the sick mice _ whose own bone marrow had been destroyed
with radiation. The surprise was that the stem cells also generated
healthy mature muscle cells that found their way through the blood
stream to the wasted skeletal muscles of the mice, and to a small
degree, restored them.
</P>
<P>
   If these immature bone marrow stem cells can give rise to muscle
cells, they might also prove to be a source of repair cells for
other kinds of tissues in the body, say the scientists, led by
Richard Mulligan and Louis Kunkel of Children's and Harvard Medical
School. This line of research could create a new kind of stem cell
therapy for a range of disorders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuela Gussoni, a biologist in Kunkel's lab and lead author on
the paper in the current journal Nature, said the findings are
important because ``in adult tissues we may have a reservoir of
stem cells that has more potential than we think'' to differentiate
into other types of cells.
</P>
<P>
   One implication is that instead of having to obtain stem cells
from embryos, with all the ethical questions that entails,
researchers may be able to use bone marrow cells as versatile
``pluripotent'' cells in developing repairs for diseased tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In a related, reverse experiment, Gussoni and her colleagues
isolated muscle stem cells from mice and showed that they could
generate adult muscle cells, as expected, but could also give rise
to bone marrow cells.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted some of the muscle stem cells to take the bone
marrow pathway isn't known _ just as scientists can't say why some
of the bone marrow cells in the first experiment ``decided''' to
become muscle cells. But they suspect that these biological
decisions are made in response to some signals from the body,
perhaps calling out for help in repairing tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leon Charash, chairman of the medical advisory committee of
the Muscular Dystrophy Association, called the findings
``exciting'' because ``the work may eventually lead to an
unanticipated treatment approach for all the muscles ravaged by
neuromuscular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscular dystrophies affect some 250,000 Americans. In 1986,
Kunkel identified the gene causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or
DMD, which affects mainly boys and is ultimately fatal. Kunkel and
his colleagues also identified the protein made by the normal DMD
gene, and named it dystrophin. The muscles of DMD patients waste
because they lack dystrophin.
</P>
<P>
   The gene discovery prompted a series of efforts to restore DMD
patients' muscles, without success to date. One tack has been to
take donor muscle cells, called myoblasts, and transplant them into
patients' muscles. This takes hundreds or thousands of separate
injections, and has not been proven to increase strength.
</P>
<P>
   Another tack uses viruses to carry the dystrophin gene into
patients' muscles. But this approach has suffered from a larger
problem in gene therapy, that the patient's immune system attacks
the foreign virus and genes and destroys them.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the new experiments are encouraging
because the stem cells are the patient's own, and because the cells
are carried throughout the muscles via blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the special stem cells that proved so versatile
in the experiment had been known for several years. They are even
more immature, or ``primative,'' than the stem cells used in
current bone marrow therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan, who heads the gene therapy program at Harvard and its
affiliated hospitals, refined a laboratory method for sorting out
the special stem cells, a rare population called SP stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The results, he said in a recent interview, ``tell us that we
may want to look in far greater detail at the possiblity of bone
marrow transplantation used to treat a range of diseases affecting
the heart, pancreas, liver and so forth.'' Moreover, he said, ``it
seems that our blood fulfills a far greater wound-healing function
than we ever thought.''

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Somehow, he had been chosen to be a stage
prop for someone's warped sense of humor. David Feherty could think
of no other reason why he was the third player in a group that
featured Bernhard Langer and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, Langer and Irwin had played starring roles in
arguably the most intense golf competition ever _ the 1991 Ryder
Cup at Kiawah Island, S.C. _ and here they were again, paired in
the first round of the German Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Feherty had also played at Kiawah, and in Germany, his stomach
still churned. He wasn't about to complain to veterans, however,
for surely they would laugh if they knew he had carried emotional
scars across the Atlantic. There was no mention of Kiawah on the
tee, so Feherty assumed it was ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   On the first green, Feherty would be the second player to putt,
and he watched Irwin lag to within inches. Out of courtesy, Feherty
told Irwin he could either mark or putt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to do,'' said Feherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to throw up. Still,'' said Irwin, before tapping in.
</P>
<P>
   Feherty laughed. So did Langer. Irwin, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first sense of relief in four days for these Ryder
Cup players, all of whom had experienced agonizing pressure at
Kiawah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryder Cup players feel they're members of a very special club,
I think,'' said Feherty. Which means those who have played in it
have to find ways to describe the experience to those who haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, who will be on his fifth Ryder Cup team, explains
the aura: ``When I lost the US Open (in 1998), the only one I let
down was myself. I didn't let down 11 other teammates, my captain,
my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the heavy burden Mark Calcavecchia put on himself at
Kiawah. Eight years later, the tears have dried, but the memory
hasn't faded. He was dormie against Colin Montgomerie with four
holes to play. His was going to be the match that stopped the
European momentum, because the two matches ahead of Calcavecchia
had ended in losses; the US trailed, 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Then, disaster, the sort that can be attributed to a swing that
fails to hold together under pressure. Calcavecchia bogeyed 15 and
16, both won by Montgomerie's pars. At the difficult par-3 17th,
Calcavecchia hit into the water twice. Then he lost the 18th as
Montgomerie miraculously salvaged a half-point for Europe.
Calcavecchia didn't stop the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Through tears he tried to determine the ramifications of his
collapse. ``At that time I had a feeling, the way things were
unfolding, we were going to lose by half a point,'' said
Calcavecchia, who was 31 at the time and a 10-year veteran of the
PGA Tour. He knew how to play in white-knuckle time, having won the
1989 British Open in a playoff against Greg Norman and Wayne Grady.
He knew heartache, having finished second 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't know how to handle this scene.
</P>
<P>
   So he cried. And he cried some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to Mark. He was visibly upset,'' said Stewart, who
played in the first singles match that day and had also lost, to
Feherty. ``But I tried to explain it was a team event. `Don't worry
about it,' I said, `It's not about you. It's about the team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't penetrate. It only reminded Calcavecchia of The Belfry
in 1989. There, Calcavecchia had lost to Ronan Raferty, the middle
match of five straight singles victories that allowed Europe to
maintain the Cup. ``I never want to go through this again,'' he
said following that defeat, but here he was two years later. Deja
vu all over again? No, and yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1989 we tied,'' said Calcavecchia, ``but that was the same
as losing. At Kiawah, we won, but that didn't feel like we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it look it, not when one considers the memory of Irwin,
standing greenside amid celebrating teammates, flying corks, and
flowing champagne. When Langer's 6-foot putt for par slid wide,
Irwin had halved their match and secured the half-point needed for
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Victory? He looked like he had been battered and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been through anything like it,'' said Irwin, who
had withstood enough pressure to win three US Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressful,'' said Calcavecchia, who was playing on his
third Cup team at Kiawah (he hasn't qualified since), though his
experience had obviously not been a factor. ``I took the Ryder Cup
the wrong way. I just wanted to win so bad that sometimes you get
in your own way. I really didn't enjoy the hoopla of the matches.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Langer, Brad Faxon lives with the memory of missing a key
putt in Ryder Cup competition. In 1995, Faxon went to the 18th 1
down against David Gilford, but he was in position to win the hole
and secure a half-point for the US.
</P>
<P>
   Had he made his putt, the US would have ended up with 14 points
and regained possession of the coveted Cup. Instead, Faxon missed
his par-save at 18, Gilford earned a 1-up victory, and Europe
prevailed, 14 1/2-13 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon concedes that the pressure at times was unbearable. But
not during that putt. ``I wasn't nervous over that putt,'' he said.
``If anything, I felt comfortable. I saw the line and just made a
bad putt.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the pressure had come earlier in the week during the first
practice round. Standing on the first tee, Faxon did something he
rarely did _ he began talking to himself. He told himself it was no
big deal, that it was just a practice round. So why, he answered,
are you about to squeeze the grip off the club?
</P>
<P>
   Faxon told himself to relax because no one was paying attention.
Who are you kidding? he answered. There are two eyes burning holes
in your back. Out of the corner of his eye, Faxon caught a glimpse
of somebody watching him. Not just anybody, either. Lanny Wadkins.
The team captain, thought Faxon, is staring right at me. It was the
most infamous stare in golf, one that for years had turned
opponents into freeze-pops on even the most stifling of days.
</P>
<P>
   Damn, thought Faxon, this is serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it was the most nervous I was, standing there on the
first tee of the first practice round. I realized Lanny was judging
every shot I made. I felt pressure on every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure, said Tom Watson, that did not subside with revisits.
He played on four teams. ``I felt more pressure as I got older,''
he said. ``I'm not sure why. But the Ryder Cup is the only event in
the world that will make your legs shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, said Jim Furyk, who will play on his second
Ryder Cup team this weekend at The Country Club, because pressure
comes with the job. ``We all deal with (it), golf-wise, on a daily
basis. Whether it's getting through Q School, making the cut,
keeping your card, making the Tour Championship, having a putt to
win a tournament . . . it's always some inherent pressure to being
a golf professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Furyk, ``The extra incentive really is playing for
that team. Then you also could add on however many millions viewers
in the US are pulling for the US, and you're part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which hits at the heart of the Ryder Cup pressure _ loyalty. At
weekly tournaments, fan support is usually spread out among dozens
of players. Some people want to see Tiger Woods win, others want
Justin Leonard, or Fred Couples, or Davis Love, or David Duval, or
so on. In the Ryder Cup, however, the line of support is clear.
You're on one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing for your country and your Tour,'' said Corey
Pavin, who played on three teams (1991-93-95), ``and all your
fellow professionals who you play with.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said ``it is riveting''
competition, which the TV audience loves. ``Weekly on our tour, the
final 2-3 hours comes down to 2-6 guys who can win, 2-6 guys whose
feet are in the fire. On the final day of the Ryder Cup, there are
24 guys whose feet are in the fire. People love that.''

 BROOKLINE, Mass.: ... love that.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They also love patriotism, that Us-vs.-Them mentality that has
turned up the dial on the pressure cooker. Not that pressure didn't
always exist. On the contrary. The late, great, and outrageously
tough Lloyd Mangrum once uttered: ``I will never, never captain an
American team again because of the 9,000 deaths I suffered in the
last hour.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1953, after a US victory, no less, but it offers
proof that the event was always taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, however, it has grown into something else.
``It's gotten personal,'' said Paul Azinger, a member in
1989-91-93.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so personal in 1983, when Jay Haas made his Ryder Cup
debut. He was 29, with seven years on the Tour. ``It was a forgone
conclusion that we would win,'' he said. Which the Americans did,
though by only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally returned to the team, in 1995 at Oak Hill, Haas
discovered that the Ryder Cup atmosphere had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played in '95, we walked out of the locker room on
Tuesday morning at 9, there were 25,000 people there watching our
practice round and chanting, `Go USA,' and, `Go, Jay.' I mean, the
hair stood out on the back of my neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that regard, it was so different from what I had
experienced in '83, and right away that almost put more pressure on
us, because here are all these people so behind us. Let's not let
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman was a Ryder Cup rookie that year, though at 36, he
was no stranger to pressure. A spot in the final pairing at the US
Open a few months earlier, as well as a Sunday duel at Augusta with
Jose Maria Olazabal the year before, had surely hardened him, yes?
Not quite. ``I was so nervous, I could hardly breathe,'' said
Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of pressure. Very simply, I think, when
you're playing on your own, you learn to be your own best friend.
You hit a bad shot, you forgive yourself, you go on. You play with
a teammate, you tend to really get a lot more hard on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas understands. Not long after Faxon had failed on the
finishing hole, Haas came to 18 with a chance to give his teammates
a victory. He needed to win the hole, but first he needed to drive
it in the fairway. Normally, no problem, but this was no normal
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pressure was probably the most I ever felt,'' said Hass,
a nine-time winner on Tour. ``I had a multitude of emotions going
through my mind right at that moment. Should I swing easy and hit
the fairway? Or swing hard? I thought too much. I tried to calm
down and tried to use my experience and not hit until I was ready
and all that stuff, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His soft, easy swing produced a pop-up drive into the left rough
a mere 200 yards away. Haas had to lay up with his second, then his
third shot hit the green and sucked back down a steep slope. When
his last-ditch chip attempt did not go in, the match belonged to
Philip Walton, the cup to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haas is not the reason the US lost that year. Just as Costantino
Rocca was not responsible for the European loss in 1993. But with
so much passion and so much emotion on the line, someone has to
take the blame. Why not play wonder ball and blame whoever has the
pressure last?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played in 1993, I lost to Davis Love,'' said Rocca.
``People supposed I lost the Cup. I'm sorry I lost to Davis Love,
but I was not the whole team. I was 1 up on the 17th tee, missed a
short putt on 17, then bogeyed 18. The other players on the team
helped me. They said, `Don't tell me this is your fault. It's not
your fault.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the plane the Monday after the '93 matches. I see the
papers, and I'm on the front page. But looking back, sometimes
you're more famous for one shot than if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Haas and Rocca can remember their shots, said Feherty.
The Irishman, now an analyst for CBS, defeated Stewart in their
singles match at Kiawah, though he isn't sure how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4 up with four to play, just like Calcavecchia against
Monty right behind us. Then, like Calcavecchia, I lost 15 and 16
and got to 17, which was the hardest par 3 in the history of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 1-iron. I have absolutely no recollection of the
swing. None. I just remember the crowd going berserk when the ball
hit the green. It was more like a football game than golf. A
terrifying moment.''
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, it hasn't turned pleasant?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Feherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shaking.''

DOLE BACKS SEARCHES OF LOCKERS, BACKPACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELROSE, Mass. _ Elizabeth Hanford Dole Wednesday chose a
sentimental setting, the school where she taught history 40 years
ago, to offer an unsentimental prescription for how to heal what
ails education.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she would ease federal regulations, would back merit
pay for teachers, and would make it easier for parents to save for
education costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most controversial with the 11th- and 12th-graders who
made up much of her audience in the Melrose High School library was
her suggestion that school officials feel free to search student
lockers and backpacks for drugs and weapons. She also said schools
should consider testing students for drugs _ if their parents
consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For drugs and weapons, I say: There will be no place to
hide,'' said Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The students, though they gave her a warm reception generally,
grumbled some at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an invasion of privacy,'' said Mike Bruce, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Mui, also 16, shook her head: ``I don't think they should
be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daria Hinz, 17, said she could accept the locker and
backpack searches, but with a caveat. ``I guess I'm OK with it as
long as there is evidence to show this person might have something
in it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, which was Dole's first major elaboration of
her education views, she made a few nostalgic stops in the school
building where worked as a student teacher _ then known as Miss
Hanford _ during the 1959-1960 school year.
</P>
<P>
   She scanned an old yearbook and dropped in on her former
classroom _ now Helen Overlan's sixth-grade English class _
creating bedlam with the horde of television cameras, police
officers and school officials who trailed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a few years, but it's good to be back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, in her speech, said her goal as president would be restore
schools to greatness. She said the Clinton adminstration had
needlessly entangled schools in a web of federal rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at this unwieldy stack of paper,'' Dole said,
painting to a thick bound copy of the Elementary and Secondary
Education reauthorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a joke if our system were working, but it's no
joke,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I will allow states and local school districts
to choose how most federal money is spent, as long as they set,
measure, and reach goals for student achievement,'' she said. ``At
last, schools will be responsible for student performance, not
paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole also said merit pay was essential for retaining good
teachers to educate the growing student population. ``It's time to
let creative, enthusiastic teachers know that they are a national
treasure right where they are _ in our classrooms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dole said she would increase the contribution limits
for education savings accounts from $500 to $3,000 a year to help
parents pay for a child's school or college education. She said she
would also like to create a $1,000 per-year tax credit for people
who donate to educational foundations helping low-income students
in public and private schools through grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   According to polls, voters consider education the most important
issue for presidential candidates to address. Sensitive to that,
the leading candidates rarely omit the subject from their campaign
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal was similar in its thrust to Texas Governor
George W. Bush, who also stresses returning power and control over
education to the states. Bush, however, would cut off federal funds
to poor schools if, after three years, a school has not improved
its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain, who has been jostling Dole for
second place in some polls (Bush is the frontrunner in all), has
not yet laid out a comprehensive plan for education. But McCain has
proposed eliminating federal subsidies for ethanol, sugar, gas and
oil to pay for a national school voucher test program.

TEXAS PASTORS HAIL NEW NATIONAL BAPTIST LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Local church officials say the new president
of the National Baptist Convention USA, the Rev. William J. Shaw,
will help the denomination rise above a damaging scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Shaw is one of the finest men in the country, and he will
make the changes needed to bring our denomination into the 21st
century,'' said the Rev. Cedric Britt, pastor of Mount Gilead
Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 65, pastor of White Rock Baptist Church in Philadelphia,
was elected last week to succeed the disgraced former president of
the convention, the Rev. Henry J. Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Marshall in East Texas, Shaw has dedicated himself to
the ministry since childhood. He preached his first sermon at 11
and was ordained as pastor of Oak Hill Baptist Church near Marshall
at 17, according to a biography supplied by his Philadelphia
church.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw graduated summa cum laude at 19 from the old Bishop College
in Dallas with a major in philosophy and religion. He also holds a
master of divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary in New
York and a doctor of ministry degree from Colgate Rochester
Divinity School at Crozer Theological Seminary in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Britt said Shaw will help the National Baptist Convention
recover from the damage caused by Lyons' actions.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is serving 51/2 years in a Florida state prison after
being convicted of racketeering and grand theft. He was found
guilty of stealing more than $4 million from corporations wanting
to do business with the 3 million-member denomination of
predominantly African-American churches.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons was also found guilty of taking nearly $250,000 in
Anti-Defamation League funds intended to help rebuild black
churches burned by arsonists. Also, he admitted to an improper
relationship with one of his female aides.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presidential candidates at last week's gathering
vowed to make major changes in the way the convention handles
money.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first acts, Shaw promised an immediate,
independent audit of the convention's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Britt attended the national convention in Tampa, Fla., and
supported another candidate, the Rev. E.V. Hill of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy about the outcome of the election, though,''
Britt said, because Shaw has committed himself to restructuring the
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make our denomination more user-friendly to local
churches,'' Britt said. He favors giving loan assistance to help
start churches in developing communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. B.R. Daniels, pastor of Beth-Eden Baptist Church in
Fort Worth, also attended the national convention and strongly
supported Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention is back on the way it ought to be under Bill
Shaw,'' Daniels said. ``I'm very grateful to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw won by about 200 votes over the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson
of Mount Vernon, N.Y. Hill came in third.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels believes that Richardson hurt his candidacy by speaking
out too harshly against Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man is already down, you don't need to kick him,''
Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, delegates took up an offering to help pay
Lyons' legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has called for a national summit of pastors to discuss
changes needed in the denomination, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the old system, the board of directors was a rubber
stamp for the president,'' Daniels said. ``We need to put the
convention back in the hands of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many churches have been giving token amounts to the national
denomination because they felt they were not getting enough out of
it, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Some National Baptist churches are becoming aligned with the
Southern Baptist Convention because of the assistance that
denomination gives pastors and churches, Daniels said.

NEW COURTROOM SHOW HANDS THE GAVEL TO STRONG WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Grey, played with a tinge of charm and vulnerability by Amy
Brenneman, is a superior court judge in need of answers.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of her first day on the job, Amy stands before
her full-length mirror in her long black robe _ and freaks. She
then leaps back into bed, pulling the covers over her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't oversleep,'' she explains later to her
eyebrows-raised mother. ``I'm in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy is in denial about a lot of things, actually, and this is
what makes all those notions about ``Judging Amy'' being a clone of
``Providence'' unfair and just plain wrong. Like the lead character
in NBC's midseason surprise, Amy left a man and job to move from
the big city to her medium-size hometown (Hartford, Conn.), where
her mother and brother wait with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparisons stop there. ``Judging Amy'' isn't merely
connect-the-dots entertainment shrewdly designed for a demographic.
It delivers a strong point of view from two strong-willed women,
based largely on the fact that Brenneman is using her real-life
mother's professional life as a dramatic guide.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who grew up in Hartford, always found her mother's
work as a juvenile court judge interesting and demanding,
particularly for a woman trying to raise a family and find time for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Judging Amy,'' Brenneman, who is one of the executive
producers, merely wonders what we all wonder, no matter what our
profession: When will someone come in and say we don't belong
there?
</P>
<P>
   In the series, Amy has reason to question it even more. She was
a corporate attorney working in Manhattan when a Harvard chum
pushed her for a judgeship. Because of a need for female judges,
she was moved along somewhat quickly. There's a scene at the dinner
table that explains this rather well, with her social worker mother
Maxine (Tyne Daly), fed up with unprepared, politically placed
judges, questioning her quick placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win it in a raffle,'' Amy explains, even going so far
as to defend her intellect. ``In order to have a friend from
Harvard, you have to get into Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Day One on the bench, during which protocol is
completely lost on her and a decision regarding the care of a child
unnerves her, she confides to her ex-husband: ``All those people
looking at me expecting me to know stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Available help her are Bruce (Richard T. Jones), a by-the-book
court services officer, and her free-spirited brother (Dan
Futterman), a high-minded college graduate who, for reasons
unrevealed as of yet, washes dogs for a living. Both serve their
purposes well. Oh, yeah. Complicating matters is Amy's 6-year-old
daughter, Lauren, played by Karle Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Brenneman says ``Judging Amy'' is more about the people she met
in her mother's court: probation officers, social workers,
attorneys, families under siege. About half the time, we'll see the
work venue; the other half will zero in on the home front, with Amy
dealing with her daughter, and particularly her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now to Daly. I can't remember ever witnessing a performance from
this actress that wasn't well-defined and striking. She strides
through the first two episodes firing opinions as though shot from
a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is anorexia?'' Lauren wants to know. ``It's a disease
women get when they read magazines,'' Maxine says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you so grouchy?'' she's asked. Maxine: ``Because I've
earned that privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly does this sort of thing with such charm that you don't mind
that her character really is something of a grouch. When we first
meet her, she's a chain-smoking former social worker trying
retirement. She spends most of her time in the garden or Internet
chat rooms, or dissecting the lives of her children.
</P>
<P>
   By the second episode, Maxine is contemplating a return to
social work, which will put her in Amy's line of fire in the
courtroom as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from these two women, what I like most about ``Judging
Amy'' is its assertion that we're all looking for answers and
formulas, that how-to manuals come with kids' toys and elaborate
shelving, but not with jobs and marriages and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't gonna work,'' Amy says at one trying point. ``Do
they let just anybody do this job?''

SYMBOLISM ABOUNDS AS BARAK MAKES FIRST STATE VISIT TO BERLIN

<P>
   SACHSENHAUSEN, Germany _ ``How come I am alive?'' Eli Carmel,
82, asked Wednesday as he stood, hunched with age, outside the
gates of the concentration camp he survived 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel, an Israeli, answered his own query as he headed toward
the brick remains of the crematory, trampling the grassy fields
where he was once forced to shovel snow until he was paralyzed, but
only with cold; he was one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was beaten unconscious and I fell in the snow,'' he
said. ``I was taken with the other stiffs back to the barracks and
we were stacked up, all the corpses. But I woke up in the night,
and I crawled out. How come I am here when so many were killed?
There is no explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a milky gray sky, Carmel proudly traveled back to the
scene of his darkest memories because Ehud Barak, the prime
minister of Israel, had invited him along with two other survivors
and their families as guests on his first diplomatic trip to
Europe. It was, as Barak and the survivors said, history come full
circle:
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the leader of the Jewish homeland, stood elbow to elbow
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, facing down the Nazis'
ovens _ now exhibitions in a grim museum. An elderly survivor,
Avraham Lanzmann, chanted the Jewish prayer of mourning,
accompanied by his grandson, a uniformed Israeli soldier, after
which the Israeli and German leaders laid wreaths and pledged to
stand together against intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that you could see,'' Barak said in Hebrew, speaking to
the camp's ghosts, ``the representatives of the state of Israel,
the Holocaust survivors and the Israeli soldiers here in
Sachsenhausen, the killing camp next to Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   On his second day in Germany, Barak made clear that the purpose
of his trip was to cement his new government's relationship with
what he sees as Israel's key ally in the European Union. Building
explicitly on the twisted bonds of history that link the two
countries, the Israeli prime minister wanted to broadcast his
alliance with Schroeder before continuing on, later Wednesday, to
France, with which Israel has a far rockier relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, in turn, had his own symbolic agenda. He chose Barak
to make the first state visit to the German capital since the
government moved to Berlin. It was a conscious move to rehabilitate
the lingering negative image of Berlin as the former seat of Nazi
power. And, wearing a yarmulke on his head, he accompanied Barak to
the concentration camp here to underscore just how far Germany has
traveled from its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to speak here at this place,'' Schroeder said
Wednesday morning. ``There is only one way to deal with the
unimaginable magnitude of the crimes committed here. We and all
others have to remember again and again. We owe it to the dead but
also to ourselves and to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who travels
constantly in a campaign to enlist support, Barak seeks personally
to recruit international backing for his ambitious goal of a quick,
broad peace with Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Germany and France play a critical role in this _ by
providing development assistance to the Palestinian Authority,
which theoretically gives both countries some leverage over Arafat,
and by exercising some influence on the governments of Syria, Iran
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Barak faced some criticism from opposition leaders
for not declining a chance to have his name marked down in history
as the first leader to pay a diplomatic visit to a city with such
painful associations for many Israelis. Some Israeli reporters
chided him for staying in the luxurious Adlon Hotel, saying that it
had once been a Gestapo stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak said that while ``the guilt of the Germans who carried
out these crimes will never be expunged,'' it was still desirable
to move into the future while remembering the past. ``I think no
one today is seriously afraid of German manipulative power games,''
he told Der Spiegel in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has new concerns, he said Wednesday, including a desire
to become a more active trade partner with Europe _ with what he
hoped would be a preferred status, not as a member but a friend of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deeply moved in my first visit to Berlin as the Prime minister
of Israel,'' Barak scrawled Wednesday in the guest book at the
residence of President Johannes Rau.
</P>
<P>
   Switching gears completely after the memorial service at
Sachsenhausen, he went out of his way to request that German
reporters transmit a tourism sales pitch to young Germans to visit
Israel in the year of the millennium. ``Jerusalem,'' he said, ``the
place where the historic countdown started.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Rabin, the late prime minister and Barak's mentor,
preceded him in a visit to Sachsenhausen seven years ago,
accompanied by Helmut Kohl, who was then German chancellor. But
soon afterward, neo-Nazi youths burned down the barracks he had
toured, and Barak implied Wednesday that the act was directly
linked to Rabin's visit.
</P>
<P>
   These were the barracks, number 38 and 39, to which Carmel, a
retired electrical engineer who now lives in Tel Aviv, had been
assigned in 1939. Born in Vienna, he had been living in Switzerland
when the Swiss police arrested him and turned him over to the
Gestapo, literally carrying him across the border at Basel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, because his parents had obtained an exit permit for him
to travel to Shanghai, Carmel, like other Jews with legal papers to
leave Europe, was released from the camp by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a training ground for the SS,'' Carmel said. ``They
learned the business here. From killing 20 to 30 of us a day, they
went on to trainloads later.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not Carmel's first trip back. He is head of a
130-member Sachsenhausen survivors' group in Israel. But he said he
had eight sleepless nights from the time he got the call from the
prime minister's office about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Barak asked Carmel to track down survivors with grandchildren
who were Israeli soldiers; the prime minister, a former general who
threw back his shoulders and snapped to attention when a German
honor guard welcomed him, believes that Israel's military strength
is the best revenge on history.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel found two such survivors. One grandson soldier, Yuval
Ronen, 19, tenderly helped his grandfather, Yerachmiel Bahor, on
and off his chair during the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to come here,'' Ronen said. ``I know it's important
to him, and it's important for me to see where he was and how he
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``To come here as a soldier of Israel is to show
that now is not like then. Then we had no country and Jews were
spread all over the world. Today there is a country. It is strong.
And the Holocaust cannot be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a cranberry velvet skullcap, Carmel, slightly bent,
stood at the site of the camp's former shooting trench and gallows.
A young Israeli woman from the northern border town of Qiryat
Shemona, stood at a microphone and hummed the national anthem,
``Hatikva.''
</P>
<P>
   The haunting tune floated through the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Schroeder's presence and the traditional protocol for
meetings of two heads of state, ``Hatikva'' was not followed by the
German anthem.

WOMEN IN EASTERN EUROPE HAVE FARED POORLY SINCE END OF COMMUNISM,
UNICEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The situation of women and girls in much of Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union has spiraled downward since the
collapse of communism, with increasing joblessness and abuse and
deteriorating social services, Unicef said Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unicef studied 27 countries in the region, examining a range of
social and economic issues affecting women and girls, and concluded
that while communist policies did not guarantee sexual equality,
women are generally worse off now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the transition to a market economy, the status of women is
eroding further,'' said Carol Bellamy, head of Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of state-supported services and the economic
crises of the past decade, many women in the region are facing
unemployment for the first time, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 million jobs have been lost in the region in the last
decade. Of these, an estimated 14 million were jobs held by women,
it says. In addition, part-time work has increased; some women hold
full-time jobs that exist only on paper and pay marginal wages.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the sixth by Unicef, on various aspects of
post-communist Europe, and Ms. Bellamy said it was the first
comprehensive look at the range of economic and social issues
affecting the 150 million women and 50 million girls in Central and
Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, the Caucasus and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the decrease in economic self-sufficiency, women
have reduced life expectancy in 16 of the 27 countries studied.
While the decline was temporary in some countries, it has persisted
in about one-third of the countries where data were available.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reasons are increased smoking, alcohol consumption,
drug abuse and unsafe sexual activity. Ms. Bellamy singled out
HIV/AIDS as one of the region's biggest problems. Five years ago,
30,000 cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, were registered.
At the end of 1998, there were 270,000, nine times as many,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia and three other countries, one of every 100 girls is
infected with syphilis, said John Micklewright, one of the authors
of the study. Increased trafficking in women worsens the situation,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Women's power to improve their lot has also been set back, with
the number of women who are lawmakers declining about one-third to
an average of 10 percent in countries studied, according to the
report. Turkmenistan had 18 percent, while Kyrgyzstan had only 1
percent of parliament members who were women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the few bright spots, Ms. Bellamy said, are the rise in
the number of women entrepreneurs and the increase in grass-roots
organizations that are beginning to take the lead in combating
domestic violence.

   AUTO-LABOR-ASSESS (Undated) _ On the surface, the tentative
agreement that the auto workers' union reached with DaimlerChrysler
last week was just the type of extravagant contract that President
John F. Kennedy had once warned the United Auto Workers against.
But the DaimlerChrysler agreement has not set off inflation alarm
bells the way it might have in the Kennedy era partly because a
contract reached with an automaker no longer sets a lockstep
nationwide pattern. Unions in most industries are far weaker than
in the 1960s _ they represent 13.9 percent of the work force, down
from more than 30 percent then. By Steven Greenhouse.

   TALI, Taiwan _ Though the daylight was gone, an old woman stood
watching the soldiers as they picked through a small mountain of
rubble to look for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   It was once her son's home, shared with his young wife. More
than 200 others also lived in the 13-story apartment building.
Thirty-nine of them lie here still, including the old woman's son,
buried somewhere beneath the chunks of concrete and the twisted
wire mesh that now look immovable.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many, if any, are still alive. Together with a
few dozen neighbors the old woman watched Wednesday night,
sometimes pacing, sometimes stepping beside a friend for a silent
embrace that seemed to win her a flicker of solace, though it
disappeared as quickly as it came. She remained unwilling to voice
the hope that somehow her son might still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't leave,'' said the woman, Tsou Chiu-yu, her eyes puffy
from spending nearly 48 hours at the site. ``I'm not optimistic.
But I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This little town in central Taiwan, near the epicenter of the
enormous earthquake on Monday, seems utterly shell shocked by the
damage, which killed more than 2,000 people, injured countless
others and destroyed thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tsou and many of her neighbors seemed mesmerized by the
swift and decisive nature of the earth's sudden quake, even if they
had not yet taken in the full impact.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers tried to save hundreds of residents trapped in
the rubble in towns throughout central Taiwan, but there were
innumerable sites and the work itself was unavoidably slow and
painstaking.
</P>
<P>
   On Hsientai Street, where Mrs. Tsou's son's apartment building
was ripped from its station and dumped to one side, residents
shuffled cautiously through a narrow and unlighted street to
inspect a broad ripple in one section of street pavement that
jutted open like a new doorway to the underworld. In the darkness,
it was hard to see what lay beneath.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Peter Tsai, said it took only 10 seconds for the
building to collapse in a heap. Or half collapse, actually. The
bottom five stories were crushed into rubble, while the top eight
remained intact, though they now lean more distinctly and
precariously than the tower in Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' said Tsai, who said he escaped unhurt from his
ground floor apartment with his wife and child after being trapped
for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed humbled by the experience. ``I don't know why we
lived,'' he said quietly. ``My good friends did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Arun Azarwal, a friend of Tsai's, was visiting Taiwan from his
native India this week. He came to Hsientai Street to watch the
rescue work Wednesday night, mindful of a mutual friend who
remained, and said he found it hard not to meditate on the
tenuousness of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' he said. ``It was the middle of the
night, so I wonder if they even woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, working in camouflage uniforms and hard helmets
while the static of walkie-talkies buzzed in the hands of a
commanding officer, had already dragged four bodies from the
wreckage on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the soldiers gingerly took apart piece after
piece of the rubble as they looked for more victims. It must have
looked excruciatingly slow to Mrs. Tsou and others with relatives
and friends buried within, but the half-collapsed building seemed
continually in danger of collapsing even more.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a shout went up. Another victim had been sighted,
deep within the mess. The crowd murmured in excitement, but it soon
became apparent that it could take hours before the soldiers would
get close enough to determine if the person was alive.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of red-shirted rescue workers from a neighboring
county arrived to help, many with flashlights taped to one side of
their helmets, like miners looking for coal in a tunnel. Tsai and a
handful of other residents took charge of directing them, fetching
ladders and pails and rope, and instructing them about leaking gas
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a war,'' marveled Kao Chen-ting, a taxi
driver who stopped to watch the soldiers at work. ``It's big and
it's terrible. You have to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many hours on the sidelines, Mrs. Tsou seemed to lose
some of her stoic demeanor, and vented some frustration that there
was not more help from official channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the government would act in a crisis to save
people,'' she complained. ``Where are they? What have they done for
us? Why do we have to endure this on our own?''

   LOS ANGELES _ May-December romance movies are a dime a dozen.
The only thing more prevalent are on-screen couplings where the age
chasm is taken at face value. Nobody snickers when Clint Eastwood
or Jack Nicholson or Robert Redford or Sean Connery (we could go
on, it's a long list) escorts some woman half his age around town.
But then, that's why Hollywood is known as the land of
make-believe, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   In a decidedly more realistic vein comes ``Guinevere,'' a
tough-minded take on the older-man, younger-woman dynamic. Here,
people not only snicker at the May-December couple, they stare and
point as well. In other words, they react like normal people would
if they spotted Grandpa putting the moves on a college girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' stars the remarkable young actress Sarah Polley
and the charming Stephen Rea as the couple in question. Polley
plays Harper, a recent college graduate, coping with the confining
expectations of her family. Mom (a devastating Jean Smart) expects
Harper to follow the family's footsteps to Harvard Law School.
Harper is so used to ceding to these presumptions that she's
willing to go along with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, she meets Connie (Rea), a bohemian photographer
who sees something in Harper no one else sees (including,
sometimes, those of us in the audience). Connie offers to become
Harper's mentor. She can live in his loft _ in San Francisco's
beatnik-meets-Banana Republic North Beach neighborhood _ with no
strings attached, provided she dedicates herself to discovering her
artistic abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're mistaking me for someone with potential,'' Harper
pouts. ``Can't I do something menial instead, like laundry?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Instead, Connie has a laundry list of books, music and
artwork for Harper to absorb. Of course, the carefree Connie isn't
solely dedicated to teaching. He wants Harper's affection, too. But
more than that, Connie loves the young woman's reverential worship
of him because, to a more seasoned observer, it would be clear that
Connie's best days are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' marks the directorial debut of writer Audrey
Wells, whose screenplays include ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs''
and ``George of the Jungle.'' It's an accomplished first effort,
piercing and personal and unafraid to explore the subtle
complexities and dicey dynamics of its central relationship. Harper
and Connie love each other, loathe each other, exploit and take
care of each other. It's real, human and, for the most part, pretty
believable.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, too, made her job easier by casting Polley and Rea.
Polley, quite simply, is the most interesting young actress working
today, astonishing in her authority and remarkable in her range.
Rea is every bit her equal, investing a wistful fragility to
Connie, a character who could easily have been a cliche, and, in
fact, has been a cliche in many lesser movies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``Guinevere'' (R; strong language, nudity, sexual
situations). &QL; 
The stars: Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley, Jean Smart. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Audrey Wells. Released
by Miramax Films. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 40 minutes. &QL; 
Playing: Laemmle's Sunset 5 in West Hollywood; Landmark's Westside
Pavilion Cinemas in West Los Angeles; Mann Criterion 6 in Santa
Monica; Laemmle's Playhouse 7 in Pasadena. &QL; 
Our rating: 3 stars &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan loves a good
conversation. ``The Big Chill,'' ``Grand Canyon'' and even ``Wyatt
Earp'' featured characters who spent a lot of time talking without
ever saying much. Now comes ``Mumford,'' an inoffensive little
comedy about a small-town psychologist who listens _ and listens _
as a parade of eccentrics spill their guts about their various
foibles and follies.
</P>
<P>
   It's all agreeable enough without ever being exciting or, at
times, even interesting. The movie and its Capra-esque townsfolk
are so polite, in fact, as to call to mind the nice, bland,
black-and-white world of ``Pleasantville'' and Tobey Maguire's
on-screen lament: Pleasant is OK. But it can't hold a candle to
actual stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Dean plays Mumford, an empathetic young psychologist who
happens to share his name with the town where he practices.
Although he just hung his shingle four months ago, the clean-cut
Mumford already has more patients than the burg's other two shrinks
combined. His secret: He's actually interested in his patients'
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among his cases: a beautiful sad sack, Sofie (Hope Davis), who
thinks she has chronic fatigue syndrome; a lonely shopaholic (Mary
McDonnell) stuck in a loveless marriage with a self-important
investment banker (Ted Danson); an image-conscious teen-ager (Zooey
Deschanel) hooked on fashion magazines; and the town's
skateboard-riding, high-tech billionaire, Skip Skipperton (Jason
Lee), a man in need of a friend, not to mention a soulmate.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in town seems to have a secret, although (to borrow a
line from Doc Mumford) these mysteries rate a 2 on a scale of 1 to
10. It's Mumford who has the biggest secret, one that Kasdan (who
wrote and directed the movie) hints at with a generous sprinkling
of clues. Since most of the indicators are pretty obvious, put
Mumford's secret at about a 3.
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan, who himself had a cameo as a psychologist in ``As Good
As It Gets,'' directs in an undeviating, low-key manner with most
of the film featuring two characters (usually the doctor and a
patient) talking. These exchanges hammer home the movie's central
conceit: People need to unburden themselves in order to understand
themselves. And to do so, they don't need expert help, just someone
who will patiently listen.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to listen _ and have a fair amount of patience _
``Mumford'' and its message might just connect with you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Mumford'' (R; nudity, language and drug content). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, Ted
Danson, Alfre Woodard, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Martin Short. &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``He was brilliant, brilliant,'' Dorothy Carchman
said, looking at a copy of a Diane Arbus photograph of her nephew,
Eddie Carmel. ``He was exceedingly bright.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not what most people see in the famous Arbus photograph,
whose caption refers not to Eddie Carmel but to ``A Jewish Giant at
Home With His Parents in the Bronx, N.Y.'' When the photo was taken
in 1970, Carmel was around 8 feet tall and weighed more than 300
pounds. In the claustrophobic scene, he towers over his mother and
father, his head bowed to avoid hitting the ceiling, a cane
supporting his weight.
</P>
<P>
   His dimensions were the result of acromegaly, caused by a tumor
on the pituitary gland that produced an excess of growth hormones
and made his lips, jaw, hands and feet swell. By 1970, his body was
so weighed down that he was barely mobile and virtually homebound.
Two years later he died of a heart attack at 36.
</P>
<P>
   The Arbus photo, which hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, gave
him a bit of immortality, all the more so because when he died his
family, steeped in the pain of his life and death, stopped talking
about him. (The Arbus estate would not allow The New York Times to
reprint the photograph.) But now that silence has produced a new
sort of immortality, a powerful 25-minute audio documentary written
and narrated by a cousin who never met him but who became
interested in his life because of the shroud her family had drawn
over it.
</P>
<P>
   The piece will have its premiere Thursday at a sold-out event at
the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and will air on National Public
Radio on Oct. 6. It tells Carmel's story through those who knew
him, including Mrs. Carchman, who is now 85, and her son, Philip,
who was Carmel's cousin and close friend. Carchman's daughter,
Jenny, who is 28, reported and narrated the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is the culmination of a fascination that began
when Jenny Carchman was 8, saw the Arbus photo, learned that Carmel
was her cousin and asked her father about him. He told her they had
been close, began to cry and that was that: even an 8-year-old can
sense a taboo, and Ms. Carchman said she never raised the subject
with him again. But as Ms. Carchman pursued her own photographic
career, the Arbus photo surfaced again and again, and she decided
to explore Carmel's life. She began filming a documentary about him
but abandoned it in favor of the radio piece, which was produced by
a friend, Stacy Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   Radio may seem a strange medium to tell the story of someone
whose plight was so acutely visual. But telling Carmel's story
through words alone has a beautiful logic: it finally disembodies
him. Listeners focus on who he was, how he felt. How he looked is
left to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you suspend your immediate impressions,'' Ms.
Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a suspension is all the more fitting because Carmel was
what one sideshow operator called ``an educated freak,'' an
intelligent, creative man with a talent for words and poems and
jokes. (``My luck, I have to have midget parents,'' he said of the
Arbus photo.) But in life, his mind was continually overshadowed by
his body.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carchman, his aunt, said that his intelligence also
heightened his pain. ``That was one of the tragedies, that he was
so sharp and understood what was wrong,'' she said. ``He understood
that his life would be different than anyone else's.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk about bad timing. ``Jakob the Liar,'' a sober
comedy set during the Holocaust, finished filming nearly two years
ago and has since sat on the shelf while its filmmakers watched the
similarly themed ``Life Is Beautiful'' steal its thunder.
</P>
<P>
   And while the two films share only a time period and,
occasionally, a tone, the comparisons to Roberto Benigni's
Oscar-winning film are inevitable and, unfortunately, rather
damning. ``Jakob's'' backdrop, as imagined by Oscar-winning
production designer Luciana Arrighi, is a horrible wonder to
behold, but the awkward balance of the film's story only
underscores the tremendous (and unlikely) accomplishment Benigni
managed to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob'' began its life as a novel by an East German writer,
Jurak Becker, and was made into a movie, ``Jakob Der Lugner'' 25
years ago. Hungarian-born director Peter Kassovitz obtained the
rights to make it into an English-language film and has been
working on doing just that, in between making feature films and
television projects from his home base in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's long gestation is evident in its remarkable visual
conception, which frightfully evokes the setting, a Polish ghetto
in the waning days of World War II. In this unnamed locale lives
Jakob (Robin Williams), one of the thousands of Polish Jews living
in the grim, Nazi-controlled slum. Relatively speaking, these
survivors are lucky. Most of their neighbors and family (including
Jakob's wife) have been shipped to the death camps. (Kassovitz
vividly captures the fearful spectre of the trains throughout the
film.)
</P>
<P>
   One day, Jakob overhears a forbidden radio news bulletin
announcing the Russian army is a mere 400 kilometers from his
ghetto. Jakob excitedly shares the optimistic news with his
despondent friends, and the friends soon extrapolate that Jakob
must have a radio himself. Now, this is bad news for Jakob because
if the Gestapo buys into the radio rumor, he will find himself
taking a one-way trip to the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob will have none of this. He lives by the creed ``the best
thing to do is nothing.'' But as word spreads about his radio, hope
_ an almost-extinct commodity _ returns to the ghetto. Thus, Jakob
faces a dilemma, one compounded by his sudden custody of a
10-year-old refugee girl (Hannah Taylor Gordon), whose belief in
the radio, and Jakob's steady stream of fictitious announcements,
keeps her going.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent in the movie's tightrope act is its mixture of
melodrama and Holocaust hijinks, as well as Williams' presence,
which has come, to some, to represent a low standard in shameless,
lip-quivering mugging. ``Jakob's'' biggest problem, though, is the
limitations imposed by its story. A capsule summary: Neighbors
think Jakob has the radio, Jakob protests, neighbors persist, Jakob
makes up comical bulletin. Repeat ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   The subplot involving the little girl is another weak element,
seemingly lifted straight out of the pages of ``The Diary of Anne
Frank.'' Whenever the film is running low on pathos, Taylor Gordon
and her saucer eyes are trotted down from the attic for some
teary-eyed theatrics. It's the movie's one odious concession to
blatant sentimentality, and it never comes close to priming the
audience's tear ducts.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, thankfully, delivers a restrained performance, aided
by a fine ensemble cast that includes Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Liev
Schreiber and Armin Mueller-Stahl. But these talented actors are no
match for the ghastly ghetto. The gravity of the place and the
period simply overpowers the lightweight story, leaving the
audience mindful that the Holocaust stands as shaky ground upon
which to build a feel-good concept. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``Jakob the Liar'' (PG-13; violence, disturbing images). &QL; 
The stars: Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Armin
Mueller-Stahl. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Peter Kassovitz. Screenplay by
Kassovitz and Didier Decoin. Released by Columbia Pictures. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 54 minutes. &QL;

 NEW YORK: anyone else's.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, Mrs. Carchman and her son came to the East Village
studio of Sound Portraits Productions, where the audio piece was
produced, to hear it for the first time. Jenny Carchman was there,
as were Ms. Abramson and Dave Isay, the founder of Sound Portraits,
acclaimed for the innovative use of radio to chronicle the lives of
inner-city boys and the denizens of a Bowery hotel, among others.
Isay was the executive producer on ``The Jewish Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you excited?'' he asked Carchman, now a 57-year-old
appellate judge who lives in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like my dentist saying to me am I excited,'' Carchman
said. He was apprehensive, he said. Next to him on the couch,
facing a copy of the Arbus photo, his mother clutched tissues she
had brought.
</P>
<P>
   The piece started with a sound montage of reminiscences about
Carmel, beginning with this: ``Eddie was a little bit on the
grotesque side.'' Almost immediately, the Carchmans began nodding
in recognition and their eyes began filling with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carchman mouthed along with her quotes. ``He was
gorgeous,'' she says in the piece. ``He was _ he was beautiful,''
she whispered as she listened.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary tracks Carmel's experiences as he grows,
mushrooming during high school so that he can barely fit through
the classroom doors at the William H. Taft High School in the
Bronx. He studied for two years at City College, but he could no
longer pretend he was normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a freak,'' Mrs. Carchman recalls him telling her late one
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie, you are the tallest person I know,'' she said she
replied. ``If you want to call yourself a freak, so be it. Now what
are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was recognize that he was too big to hide. He went
out into the world and accepted the minor celebrity that came his
way, always trying to parlay it into something more. ``Eddie
Carmel, Tallest Man on Earth, Wants Booking on Talent Alone,'' one
headline read. He tried stand-up comedy and voice-overs, recorded a
song called ``The Good Monster'' and in 1963 had a bit part in a
movie, ``The Brain That Wouldn't Die.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end Carmel was simply too big to succeed in show
business. He turned to the circus and sideshows, unhappily, by all
accounts. His health deteriorated _ first one cane, then two, then
a wheelchair _ and so did his mood. Those who knew him at the
sideshows described him as bitter and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a look,'' Irwin Sherman, his best friend, says in the
documentary, referring to Carmel's dawning realization that he was
going to die. At that point, the Carchmans, listening to the
audiotape, had a look too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abramson and Ms. Carchman went to great lengths to track
down pieces of Carmel arcana, even finding the sideshow collector
who purchased his clothes, underwear and all, from the Carmels
after their son's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abramson posted notices on Web sites like
www.backinthebronx.com, where former Bronx residents exchange
sepia-toned memories about candy stores and marbles tournaments,
and was deluged with messages from people who remembered Carmel.
For many, he seemed to evoke the Bronx of the 1950s and 1960s,
nostalgically remembered as a place of shtetl-like neighborhoods
where everybody knew everybody _ and everybody knew Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people started coming out of the woodwork, no one could
get enough of talking about him,'' Ms. Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Eddie's last appearances, in the early 1970s, was at the
opening of a shopping center in Co-op City in the Bronx. Carmel was
so sick, so heavy, at that point that he could not even get out of
his chair. Two thousand people booed and threw cups at him. ``You
expect the man who is eight-three to stand eight-three, that's part
of the deal,'' the man who had hired Carmel told Ms. Carchman and
Ms. Abramson, explaining why he did not want to pay for the
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories are a reminder of the cruelty that shadowed him. At
the circus, people would stick pins in his feet to see if he was
real. Carmel would lean over to his friend, Sherman, and say, ``And
they call me a freak?''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Carchmans both said the piece showed them that Carmel,
who to them was gentle, gregarious and good-natured, endured more
pain than they realized. The indignities did not end with his
death, when a coffin had to be custom built as his clothes had been
custom-made in life.
</P>
<P>
   At Carmel's funeral, a cousin who barely knew him delivered a
eulogy calling his life a tragedy, a waste of a human life.
Carchman, then 30, had sat silently, wanting to stand up and say
that his cousin's life was not a tragedy, not a waste, but much
more. He did not, and it has pained him all these years, largely
accounting for the long silence his daughter has now penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Carmel's death, his parents, now dead, moved to
Israel, where their son had been born. The day before they left,
Carchman said he told Carmel's mother what he had wanted to say at
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, why didn't you?'' she yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Carchman cried that day, he said, and he cried again the other
night listening to the audiotape. Ms. Carchman and Ms. Abramson had
tracked down the cousin, and he had reprised his eulogy almost
exactly, once again saying that Carmel's story was ``of a tragedy
of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally Carchman has his say. ``His life was not a tragedy _
he was not a recluse, he didn't hide in a cave,'' he says in the
documentary. ``He took what God had given him'' _ Carchman starts
crying, then finishes _ ``he did what he could. Everyone left that
funeral thinking that this was an empty, tragic life, and it
wasn't.''

   JAMALPUR, India _ In this poor, muddy village in the heart of
the world's largest democracy, Binda Prasad, a burly man whose
mustache twirls up in a flourish, tells a story about himself _ a
story of triumph, humiliation and fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of millions of Indians vote in national elections
this month, his parable of village life helps explain why people
like him, from the most despised castes, are voting in greater
numbers, gaining new influence and turning political calculations
upside down as they refine the very meaning of the centuries-old
caste system.
</P>
<P>
   His story goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Prasad, a landless laborer, became the first of
his caste to be elected village chief under a new constitutional
amendment that guarantees a portion of such positions to people
from the lowest rungs of the caste hierarchy. On India's
Independence Day, as hundreds of villagers gathered to watch him
unfurl the national flag, he sat in a place of honor, at last an
equal of the upper-caste men who had always governed.
</P>
<P>
   But at that very moment, he recalled bitterly, a man from the
dominant, landed upper caste grabbed him by the neck, threw him
from his chair, beat and kicked him and demanded to know how he
dared sit before his betters on a chair, rather than on the ground.
The villagers looked on but did nothing to stop the man.
</P>
<P>
   Shamed and frightened, Prasad fled. But he did not give up. When
the police failed to make a quick arrest, he said, he went to the
local leaders of the Majority Society Party, which is grounded on
the votes of humble, low-caste men and women like himself, and they
pressed the local authorities to jail the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's leaders visit this area, listen to the poor people
and do anything they can to help us,'' he said. ``When we are
subjected to caste atrocities, they console us, get the complaint
registered and make sure action is taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, most voters from the lowest castes here in India's
most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, have given their loyalty to the
Majority Society Party, which has also built a strong following in
several other north Indian states.
</P>
<P>
   The growing political power and independence of the lowest
castes, generally referred to as ``scheduled castes'' because of
their enumeration in the constitution for special benefits, is
being felt not just in north India, but across the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are voting in greater proportions than ever before, greater
even than the upper castes, according to voter surveys conducted in
1996 and 1998 by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies
in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is leading to greater social equality for people who
had been excluded from political power for the first three or four
decades of Indian independence,'' said Yogendra Yadav, a political
scientist who supervised the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   India's founders had dreamed half a century ago of a casteless
society, but caste has proved a resilient force. Paradoxically,
this hierarchical, hereditary system that has oppressed the lower
orders of society has also become an organizing principal that the
downtrodden themselves have seized on to forge their own political
identity and to seek electoral power.
</P>
<P>
   Like African-Americans in the United States, many in the lowest
castes have spurned the old names given to them _ as ritually
impure untouchables who cannot even drink from the same well as
upper castes, or as Harijans, a Hindu word meaning Children of God
that the independence leader Mohandas Gandhi gave them _ for the
more in-your-face term Dalit, which means oppressed or ground-down
in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   In Uttar Pradesh, where Dalits make up a fifth of the
population, they have largely deserted the Congress Party, which
was dominated by the English-speaking elite that ruled India for
most of its 52 years of independence, but that failed to share real
power with the lowest castes it depended on for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of stamping the Congress Party symbol of a raised
hand, most chose the elephant, symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party,
Hindi for Majority Society Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for the Hand many years ago,'' said Puran Kahar, an
illiterate man in a loincloth who still performs his lowly caste
job of carrying water for the upper castes here in the village.
``But they didn't listen to us, so we don't vote for them
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Majority Society Party was founded in 1984, and its leaders
have emerged from the still small section of Dalits who have gone
to universities or held government jobs because of constitutionally
mandated affirmative action requirements.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole party was born out of bureaucrats,'' said D.L.
Sheth, a sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest successes of the party have been in Uttar Pradesh,
population 160 million, where its vote tallies have grown from 10
percent in 1989 to 20 percent last year, with substantial support
from middle castes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders have baldly sought political power, rather
than build a movement based on an agenda of specific social and
economic reforms. They believe that only by gaining power will
Dalits be treated with dignity and win their share of patronage and
development resources, say scholars who have studied the party.
</P>
<P>
   Mayawati, a sharp-tongued, aggressive leader of the party, has
relished talking back to upper castes, a heady reversal of roles
for people who long kept silent out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent television talk show, a member of the audience asked
how she could justify her lavish way of life in the name of the
scheduled castes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this pinching your stomach?'' she scathingly replied,
suggesting the questioner was an upper-caste man who couldn't
digest the idea of a Dalit succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Uttar Pradesh, the party has parlayed alliances with other
parties into brief spells when it ran the state. In 1995 and again
in 1997, Ms. Mayawati _ a former schoolteacher who like many Dalit
women has only one name _ became the first, and as yet, only Dalit
woman ever to serve as chief minister of an Indian state.
</P>
<P>
   In the two periods in which she ruled for a total of 10 months,
she is widely credited _ or blamed _ for turning the state
machinery to the benefit of Dalits, requiring that state jobs be
set aside for them, insisting that land promised to the landless be
handed over, and brusquely and summarily suspending bureaucrats who
were laggards in carrying out her orders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This April, the party's five members of Parliament toppled the
national coalition government led by the Hindu nationalist Bhartiya
Janata Party, which lost by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent rally in Jansath, in western Uttar Pradesh, Ms.
Mayawati gleefully recalled for the thousands who had gathered in a
monsoon-swamped field how she had tricked the BJP into thinking her
party would abstain on the confidence vote, then cast the deciding
negative votes on the floor _ getting revenge on a party that she
believed had betrayed her own in the dog-eat-dog world of Uttar
Pradesh politics.
</P>
<P>
   She also laid out the party's unashamedly caste-based strategy
for winning power.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While keeping the leadership of the party firmly in Dalit hands,
Majority Society Party has recruited candidates who are Muslims or
from the middle and upper castes to run under the party's banner in
most of the 85 parliamentary seats in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus is simple: The party's minority base among Dalits
is not enough to win most elections, but with the support of even
one more community it has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all those laws in the constitution to be implemented,''
Ms. Mayawati said, ``we have to have representation in
Parliament.''

<P>
   Along the bumpy, bone-rattling road that runs south from
Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, into one of the poorest,
most backward parts of India, the color blue and the elephant
symbol of the Majority Society Party are everywhere visible.
</P>
<P>
   Blue elephants are painted on the whitewashed sides of huts.
Blue plastic flags festoon small shops. In one village, a homemade
stucco statue of the hero of the scheduled castes, B.R. Ambedkar,
stood erect and well tended in a small shrine in a weedy field, his
suit and horn-rimmed glasses painted the party's trademark blue. In
another village, a small crowd gathered around a man with a
megaphone who exhorted them to ``Stamp the elephant!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Uttar Pradesh, the party's organization has penetrated deep
into the villages where most Indians still live.
</P>
<P>
   The party workers who cover the village of Jamalpur operate out
of Banda, a bustling provincial town whose streets are clogged with
cows and scooters and whose roads and electrical system are
typically decrepit in a state notorious all over India for how
badly it has been governed.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, just after the entire town went black in one
of its regular power failures, the party's offices were found up a
narrow concrete flight of stairs. Half a dozen young men sat on the
floor in a room with no furniture, huddled over voter lists
illuminated only by two small candles.
</P>
<P>
   Most had first become involved in party work during their
student days. ``The party stands for equality, brotherhood and
social change,'' said Harish Kumar, 32, who is himself a Dalit and
secretary of the party's local division.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, they pulled out the ledger where they had numbered
and recorded in small, neat script each time a person came to them
for help and what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 was a request for assistance in applying for a hand pump.
No. 27 was a complaint made by a laborer who had not been paid for
his work in the fields. No. 36 was a complaint from a Dalit man who
said he had been beaten by upper-caste Brahmins. No. 59 was a
complaint that upper-caste Thakurs had tried to rape a Dalit woman.
</P>
<P>
   The party's workers seek to spread its message from village to
village. It is a hard, unglamorous job.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Jamalpur, population 5,000 and about six miles
north of Banda, is fairly easy to reach, but the road stops at its
edge. There are no blacktops into the village and few bricked
lanes. On a recent afternoon, after hours of torrential rains, the
pathways were a swamp of slimy muck marked by the deep ruts of
oxcarts. Every cow wore socks of brown mud.
</P>
<P>
   The thatched hut of Prasad, the village chief, was a half-hour
hike into Jamalpur. Sitting on his wooden cot outside his front
door, he reminisced about his days as a schoolboy, when upper-caste
teachers made him sit on the benches at the back of the room
because he was from a scheduled caste, and the times, years ago,
when the upper castes kept his kind from voting by refusing to give
them time off from the fields to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Things are better now, he said. The government takes their
grievances more seriously, and the scheduled castes have also begun
to stand up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the memory of his own disgrace on Independence Day 1995
rankles. Prasad is a farm worker who earns just a dollar a day, but
what he wants from politics, more than an end to his poverty, is an
end to the indignities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can always work to fill our stomachs,'' he said. ``But the
humiliations hurt the most.''

MUM'S NOT THE WORD FOR `MUMFORD' PSYCHOLOGISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan has dabbled in a variety of
genres, but his favorite theme is the angst of middle-class
(usually white) people. Kasdan's latest, the genial seriocomedy
``Mumford,'' is his best take on the topic, avoiding the
self-satisfaction that marred ``The Big Chill'' and the
self-importance that hindered ``Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumford _ the title refers to a picturesque California town and
to the unorthodox psychologist who treats some of its residents _
works simply because it's so relaxed. Loren Dean _ who has somehow
gone from looking like Matthew Modine's brother to looking like
Charles Grodin's more handsome son _ plays the amiable doc, whose
methods include cutting off patients when they begin to bore him
and kicking them out when they get on his nerves. He's also not
above divulging their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mumford is a small town, it has enough neurotics to
keep the doc's practice jumping. They include a pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince) with a highly developed (albeit old-fashioned) sexual
fantasy life; a lawyer (Martin Short) who's so egotistical that
when he dreams, everyone else is naked and he's the only one who
has studied for the test; a compulsive shopper (Mary McDonnell);
and an anorexic teen-ager (Zooey Deschanel, daughter of celebrated
cinematographer Caleb). The only well-adjusted person in town seems
to be the diner owner (Alfre Woodard), who's the doctor's best pal.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Mumford's two newest patients have as much effect on him as
he does on them. One is a lonely, boyish computer tycoon (Jason
Lee) who just wants someone to play with; another is a woman
suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (Hope Davis) who sparks an
instant attraction in the shrink.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the doctor tells the fatigued woman that he can
instantly give himself a headache by having two conflicting
thoughts, which kind of describes my feelings about Kasdan. His
talents for interesting characters, sharp dialogue and ambitious
topics are admirable; his tendency to make his actors emphasize the
profundity of that dialogue, as if they were in diction class, is
an irritating sign that he's a little too enraptured of his own
intelligence. Fortunately, Kasdan also has a knack for assembling
great casts that can overcome some of his more troublesome habits.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dean's laid-back, almost deadpan interpretation of
Mumford is off-putting, but it soon becomes clear how well his
underplaying serves the role, which could easily have turned into a
sanctimonious, Robin Williams-style portrayal of One Man Against
the Establishment. Dean anchors a perceptive ensemble that's topped
by Davis _ who can make you believe that the word ``winsome'' was
invented for her _ in yet another of her keenly observed
performances. Only Lee _ so good as a jerk in ``Chasing Amy,'' so
miscast as a nice guy in ``Kissing a Fool'' _ seems uncomfortable
with his part as the wide-eyed, unshaven computer geek.
</P>
<P>
   If Kasdan is like Mumford, he must give himself headaches
easily, because he also seems to be in conflict with himself here _
the Hollywood director struggling to reconcile the offbeat with the
conventional. Much of Mumford shines with originality, but it risks
collapse with a subplot in which the lawyer (Short, who's badly
used here) attempts to conspire with the town's two other shrinks
to discredit Mumford. The crowd-pleasing ending is also a little
too pat; Kasdan is still more screenwriter than director, and he's
far too keen on tying up all his loose ends rather than leaving any
mess behind.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mumford'' is such an easygoing, loose movie that it's
tough to mind Kasdan's indulgences. And he manages to say a lot
about psychobabble, consumerism, sex, vanity and even Hollywood
without losing his way or cramming things down our throats. His
ultimate message in ``Mumford'' is that we should learn to listen a
little better; it should be obvious, but it isn't, and so it's a
message we can all bear to hear _ especially when we're being
entertained so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' is rated R for nudity, strong language and sexual
situations.

WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A TELECOMMUTER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Sept. 24.) 
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before we begin, we should define the word ``telecommuter.''
Some of my jealous colleagues at the newspaper define it as ``a
person who is paid to sit around the house watching daytime
television in his pajamas.'' While there is some truth to that
definition, it does not really capture all of the grim realities of
the telecommuting experience, such as dragging oneself out of bed
at the crack of 11:30 and the strict rule forbidding the
consumption of blender drinks while operating the laptop.
(Pineapple juice makes the keys sticky.)
</P>
<P>
   It is important to stress the grim realities of telecommuting to
those unfortunate drones who continue to toil away in grim, gray,
blender-free offices because to them it sounds like dying and going
to heaven:
</P>
<P>
   _ No twitchy boss on his eighth cup of Folgers breathing down
your neck.
</P>
<P>
   _ No white-knuckled drives through rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ No filthy public bathrooms. (Your filthy bathroom is for your
use and yours alone.)
</P>
<P>
   _ No more working in a cramped, soulless cubicle. (From now on
you get to work in a cramped, soulless spare bedroom.)
</P>
<P>
   So what are the grim realities? For one thing, working alone at
home all day, you sometimes get a little desperate for human
companionship. Some telecommuters actually look forward to calls
from telephone solicitors so they have someone to chat with. The
monthly visit of the bug man is as special to the telecommuter as a
visit by the queen might be to someone more socially connected.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of time, the telecommuter begins to take on the
appearance of Ben Gunn, the marooned castaway in ``Treasure
Island.'' The scraggly hair; tattered, disheveled clothes (or
pajamas, as the case may be); halting speech and wild, frightened
eyes, like those of a rat just before it's flattened by a semi, are
typical of a person who spends his or her days alone in a big,
empty house with nothing but a computer, television, stereo,
fully-stocked refrigerator, swimming pool, books, newspapers,
magazines and video games to break the monotony.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite these grim realities, telecommuting can be a
pretty sweet deal. If you're a disciplined, self-motivated person
(i.e. no more than two Bloody Marys before 8 a.m.) and you've got
the right kind of job (i.e. writing three weekly newspaper humor
columns that require no research or interviews), then telecommuting
may be for you.
</P>
<P>
   But take my advice: On those days that you've got to pop into
the office, try to remember to wear clean pajamas.
</P>

FIRE ANTS IN THE HOME CAN BE DANGEROUS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DORIS CHANDLER    
 Gainesville (Fla.) Sun    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Fire ants can pose a threat in nursing homes
and places where people are bedridden or otherwise immobile,
researchers reported this week in the issue of Annals of Internal
Medicine,
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, 10 people have been attacked indoors by fire ants,
including four residents of nursing homes. Two of the nursing home
residents died, the researchers found. Three of the reported
attacks occurred in apartment complexes; one happened in a hotel;
and two were in private homes _ including an attack on a 5-day-old
infant in a crib.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the people attacked had pre-existing neurological
impairments, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia and
developmental disabilities, according to the report, which examines
indoor fire ant attacks on people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire ants are all over the southeastern United States and
California, and we're not going to completely eradicate them,''
said David F. Williams, a co-author of the report and a
Gainesville-based research entomologist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. ``But we need to be aware if they are in schoolyards,
inside nursing homes and clinics, or anywhere people are bedridden
and can't defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that in times of drought, fire ants don't find
much food and water outside, so they move inside. Bedridden
patients might have bits of food around them that would attract the
ants, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two fire ants come in and find the food source, and
soon a trail of them are coming in. These are aggressive fire ants,
and when the patient moves, they begin to sting,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most pesticides available for destroying fire ant mounds
are nontoxic to humans and can be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   Williams co-wrote the article with Dr. Richard D. deShazo,
professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, and Dr. Edward S. Moak, a
private-practice physician in Brookhaven, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants have expanded their territory into states such as
California and Virginia, where people are not as familiar with
them, said deShazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Southerners are pretty much aware of the problem, but the
fire ants are expanding their range so rapidly that there are a lot
of neophytes now becoming acquainted with them, and we want to make
sure that as many people as possible in the medical community are
aware of the medical consequences,'' deShazo said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal of the report is to make sure people understand
that these ants sting inside dwellings as well as outside, he said.
``They're just as mean inside as they are outside,'' deShazo said.
</P>
<P>
   DeShazo said professional extermination services should be
sought if fireants are found inside a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have ants inside, then they have an active fire ant
colony either in the wall or in the foundation,'' deShazo said,
``and you can't take care of the problem with sprays, because you
have to kill the queen.''

 &HT;    College student's body recovered; at least 40 dead
 &HT;    By Travis Fain
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ East Carolina University police pulled a
student's body from the water near the campus Wednesday, bringing
Pitt County's death toll from Hurricane Floyd to three with one
other man presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Child's death is one of more than 40 in eastern North Carolina
attributed to flooding and Hurricane Floyd. In Pitt County, two
Hispanic men were found dead in their car near Grimesland Friday.
Their names have not been released pending notification of the
families.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw a fourth man swept off a collapsing bridge on N.C.
33 near the entrance to the Brook Valley neighborhood last
Wednesday night. Police have called off their active search, which
once included a scuba diving team and an officer's personal fishing
boat, for the unidentified man, . A detective is still
investigating the case, said Capt. K.M. Smeltzer from the
Greenville Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Child, 18, was a freshman at ECU. The medical examiner's
office ruled his death an accidental drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Child had been missing since around 2 p.m. Thursday when he
disappeared from his brother Adam's apartment, his mother, Tina
Child, said Monday. He'd been taking a nap and his wallet and keys
were left in the apartment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother put up posters, purchased an ad in a newspaper and
got Aaron's name, picture and age on local news broadcasts in an
effort to find her son.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found around 9 a.m. Wednesday in water near the
intersection of 10th Street and College Hill Drive, ECU police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of other missing people continue to be called in to
sheriff's deputies and Greenville police. Many reports are from
family members who can't locate people displaced by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   But the county's death toll is likely to rise as the water
recedes, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not get overly optimistic about this,'' Pitt County
spokesman Barry Gaskins said. ``We've got a vast area that is under
water right now ... it would be very premature and prematurely
optimistic to think (the three confirmed fatalities are) all.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many are dead, said Rick Fisher, sheriff's
department chief of Community Patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would tickle me more than to send our teams in and
come up with a big goose egg,'' Fisher said. ``I don't guess it's
realistic, but it's hopeful and still entirely possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a county-by-county list of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bertie County _ A man who went to help someone with a stalled
vehicle in Windsor was swept away by floodwaters from the Cashie
River. Another man died after bailing water from a stalled car;
possibly was due to a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Columbus County _ A man had a fatal heart attack after being
rescued in his car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Craven County _ Badger J. Chandler, 76, of Vanceboro, was
washed away while traveling on a flooded road.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duplin County _ A man was found in a ditch in Wallace,
possibly drowned. There are three other confirmed deaths here,
though details are not available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgecombe County _ Six drowned after a boat carrying 12 people
from their flood-threatened homes near Pinetops capsized. The
victims include Teshika Vines, 5, Ben Mayo, Vivian Mayo, Keisha
Mayo, 24, Cabrina Flowers and Destiny Flowers. A woman was killed
in a collision on a wet highway. Another motorist was killed in an
accident blamed on high water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Halifax County _ James Stokes, 65, of Hobgood, drowned after
being trapped in his vehicle in Scotland Neck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnston County _ Paul Wesley Mobley, 31, of Clayton, and his
daughter Emily Mobley, 5, died when the vehicle they were in on
Rural Rd. 1525 was carried into Swift Creek. Eusebio Maldonado, 30,
of Clayton, died when his vehicle struck the water near Rural Road
2339 and sank into Little River Creek.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jones County _ James Wilder, a 70-year-old state Department of
Transportation worker from Trenton, was killed while helping a
stranded motorist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lenoir County _ Lynwood Earl Gooding, 56, of Kinston, drowned
when his car ran into several feet of water on U.S. 70.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nash County _ A woman died after her car stalled on Interstate
95 in 4 feet of water; possibly due to a heart attack. Two
motorists in a vehicle on U.S. 64 just east of Nashville were
washed away by a swollen creek. One motorist in a vehicle on U.S.
64 in Rocky Mount was taken off the highway into floodwaters. One
motorist in a vehicle on N.C. 48 was swept away by a swollen creek.
Richard Phillips, 40, was found Tuesday off U.S. 301.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Hanover County _ William T. Jones, 31, a worker with
Haynes Electric Utility Corp. in Asheville, was electrocuted when
an accidental charge came off a line where he was working near
Castle Hayne.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pender County _ William Nixon, 47, drove his vehicle into high
water on Penderlee Highway and was swept away by flood water.
Another man was swept away by flood water on I-40.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    City water crisis nears end
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Water pressure in some Greenville homes _ hit
hard by rains from Huuricane Floyd _ increased Wednesday and could
be restored fully by Thursday morning, Greenville Utilities' top
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials shifted systems from the now stabilized
electric substation, which has survived threats from floodwaters,
to its submerged water treatment plant, which still is battling the
Tar River's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   GUC crews shuttled by boat to the water plant while trying
Wednesday to dry out the facility and reactivate water pumps that
treat water from the Tar River.
</P>
<P>
   If overnight efforts are successful, residents could have full
service restored Thusday, said Malcolm Green, GUC's general
manager/CEO. But the plant also must fill elevated storage tanks _
which hold 3 1/2 million gallons _ and find and repair broken
distribution pipes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it difficult to pinpoint when the water will be
restored, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows that one,'' he said. ``If everything works right,
by morning they could see everything back right.''
</P>
<P>
   The water loss is the latest of the hurdles Greenville residents
have endured since Hurricane Floyd dumped 13 inches of rain on the
area a week ago. The downpours fell on an already saturated ground
from Hurricane Dennis' repeat visits and other recent rain.
</P>
<P>
   The combination produced the worst flood in Greenville's
history. Three Pitt County residents have died, another is presumed
dead, and preliminary damage estimates have topped $1.6 billion for
Pitt County alone.
</P>
<P>
   The overflowing Tar River, which peaked at 29.72 feet Tuesday at
five feet above the 100-year floodmark set in 1919, has forced
thousands of residents from their homes and engulfed houses,
apartments and offices.
</P>
<P>
   A boil-order still remains for residents who do have water.
Customers of Eastern Pines and Bell Arthur water corporations also
should boil water for three minutes to kill any bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, water heaters shouldn't be turned back on until
residents see water flowing at a normal rate, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   One of three submerged pumps that bring water from the Tar River
to be treated was restored by early Wednesday, and filters were
cleaned of debris.
</P>
<P>
   The combination resulted in pressure increasing for some of the
26,130 water customers.
</P>
<P>
   While the city again asked most businesses to voluntarily close
because of fire concerns, the Pitt County Health Department lifted
a restriction Wednesday on restaurants because many have regained
water service.
</P>
<P>
   But they must have enough water pressure to adequately clean
dishes and flush toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be just dribbling out of the faucet,'' said Jack
Weathersby, of the food and lodging section of Pitt County
Environmental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were making spot checks, but had found only a few
minor problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people are cooperating with us,'' Weathersby
said. ``That has not been too much of a problem today.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers like grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies,
all of which sell food, beverages and necessary toiletries, are
exempt from the city's voluntary closure request.
</P>
<P>
   While the fire department has arranged for back-up supplies from
the west, it doesn't want to take chances. On Wednesday,
firefighters only had one-tenth of the pressure they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking them a long time to restore the pressure that they
need,'' said Katie Veilleux, the city's public information officer.
``We still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Greenville Utilities shifted the focus of their
creative engineering from the electric substation to the water
treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having trouble, believe it or not, getting water out of
the river,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitt-Greenville Airport is submerged, with boats replacing
airplanes over the runways. GUC's Mumford Road operations center
also is flooded.
</P>
<P>
   The water has shut down roads throughout the county, including
most bridges in and out of town. Even when the water recedes, some
roads could remain closed because of water damage.
</P>
<P>
   With the crisis catching the attention of national media,
agencies from as far away as Alabama have offered to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people all over the country volunteering to bring
water in,'' Veilleux said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other type of water residents and officials wish would
go away. After cresting Tuesday, the Tar River receded more than
four inches overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a drop in the bucket, but it is going in the right
direction,'' said Jones, GUC's electric director.
</P>
<P>
   Once the water is gone, the cleanup will begin. On Wednesday,
the city assembled three-member assessment teams that must inspect
dwellings for safety and damage before residents will be allowed to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Officials already are concerned about snakes, dead animals and
dozens of other hazards the water potentially could leave behind,
Veilleux said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors in Rocky Mount found two dead bodies in two days,
City Manager Ron Kimble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what is under this water,'' Veilleux said. ``Now
the water is receding and we are entering into another phase of
this disaster. This is just going to be a huge job.''

 &HT;    GRIEVING TAIWANESE STRUGGLE TOWARD QUAKE'S EPICENTER TO AID
RELATIVES, RESCUERS FIND MORE BODIES
 &HT;    EDS: Updates with fresh casualty figures in 4th graf
 &HT;    With Photo.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese by the thousands threaded across
half-ruptured bridges here Wednesday, past fresh rockslides and
across miles of rippled asphalt to search for relatives at the
epicenter of the Taiwan earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With rescue efforts complicated by Wednesday's aftershocks, they
found that nature had dealt capriciously with this mountain town of
89,000 people closest to the quake's ground zero. Here and
elsewhere in Taiwan's hardest-hit Nantou County it looked as if the
quake had hopscotched across the landscape like a giant tornado,
devastating one place while leaving adjacent territory seemingly
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what seemed just as remarkable was that anyone could have
survived the epicenter's fury Tuesday, and then three jolting
aftershocks measuring 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0 _ the strongest of more than
2,000 that have rocked the island _ on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks were feared to have triggered mudslides, cracked
one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs and forced evacuations, as the
death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,032 people, officials
said. There were estimates that more than 6,500 were injured. Some
2,600 people were believed to be trapped in rubble more than 200
were still missing, but rescuers were finding more bodies than
survivors as they bored into collapsed houses and high-rise
apartment complexes across central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, relatives and rescue workers here in
Puli had pulled out 180 dead bodies from the wreckage of more than
1,000 squashed buildings. Another 1,020 people have turned up
injured, and the scent of decaying bodies indicates that at least
some others remain in the wreckage of buildings that seemed to have
collapsed to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the people remaining under the rubble are all
dead,'' Mayor Hung Ming Chang told reporters about 40 hours after
Monday's quake that measured 7.6 on the open-ended Richter scale.
The mayor estimated that one-fourth of his town had been totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on this island of 22 million, rescue efforts yielded
just nine people pulled alive from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Much-needed rescue crews from Fairfax Co., Va., and Miami-Dade,
Fla., arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and rescued a man who had been
trapped 48 hours inside a caved-in apartment building in the town
of Touliu.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my building?'' 33-year-old survivor Hsu
Tse-kai asked repeatedly, according to the Associated Press, as the
crews spent eight hours digging him out of a four-story chunk of
building that had been compressed into about 10 feet of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue workers then started digging deeper in search of a
1-year-old boy, saying they were encouraged by listening devices
that appeared to pick up the sound of a child's toy, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 countries have sent earthquake specialists to the
island, including the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey,
Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Central News Agency placed the number of foreign specialists
in the country at about 500, with more scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Puli, at least, the fast-moving relief effort seemed
markedly more effective than the near-paralysis that beset Turkish
agencies when a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck central Turkey in
August, killing more than 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And by whatever quirk of the way nature's tectonic plates
collided in the belly of the earth, many of Puli's inhabitants
lived to tell about it. And although most buildings suffered cracks
in interior walls, most looked relatively undamaged from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Puli, desperate relatives had to drive their cars or
motorcycles across a dozen precarious bridges whose pavement had
sunk or collapsed. Some were passable only because workers laid
down patches that looked like steel band-aids across gaps in the
joints of bridge sections.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was a journey to grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is still buried there in the first floor,'' said Luo
Jian Zhe, a 33-year-old salesman, clutching an incense stick as he
watched Japanese and Taiwanese rescue crews drilling into his
prosperous in-laws' collapsed four-story home. Luo watched rescuers
haul out the corpses of
</P>
<P>
   four of his in-laws, only to learn that his sister, too, had
been found crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   For others like semiconductor engineer Child Lee(CQ), joy was at
the other end of the perilous ascent from western Taiwan's
relatively untouched coastal flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't know what was going on here because we couldn't
connect by telephone,'' said Lee, 33, ``so we had to come up here
somehow to see.'' Lee found that his sister's father-in-law, a
retired bank executive, had survived unhurt and with most of his
possessions intact within a few miles of the epicenter of one of
Taiwan's deadliest quakes since a 7.4 magnitude tremor hit the
island in 1935, killing 3,276 people. Taiwan is hit by dozens of
quakes each year, but most are centered in the Pacific Ocean east
of the island and cause no damage.
</P>
<P>
   The ravaging of this Puli alone, accounted for nearly one-tenth
of the deaths due to the earthquake throughout Taiwan, and
one-fourth of the island's earthquake injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With Puli emerging on Taiwanese television reports as the center
of devastation, the high command of the Taiwanese Army flew and
trucked in hundreds of soldiers to mount a formidable
military-style relief effort for Puli and surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat this calamity like a war,'' said Maj. Gen. Wu Se Hui,
one of a procession of senior commanders who have been arriving
aboard helicopter relief flights to supervise local aid efforts.
``Once the order comes down from the top, we can move very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 24-hour period, the Taiwanese Army landed more than 60
helicopter loads of food, bottled water, tents, frozen blood and
other supplies in Puli's makeshift rescue center in an athletic
field behind an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   With the morgues and hospitals in Puli overflowing with scores
of corpses, the Army began flying in blocks of ice and body bags to
prevent the victims from decomposing before they could be examined
by forensic investigators and then buried.

TY-GAH WOWS 'EM AT TCC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ He never knew his name had an H in it until he got
to Clyde Street. ``Ty-gah,'' people kept shouting at Tiger Woods as
he strode along The Country Club's sodden fairways Wednesday
morning. ``Ovah heah, Ty-gah.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance, a nod, a wave, anything. They'd risen before dawn.
hundreds of them, and clambered onto shuttle buses and now they
were standing half a dozen deep along the ropes in the drizzle and
dribble, watching a Ryder Cup practice round.
</P>
<P>
   These were the people who couldn't get tickets to the main event
on the weekend, who didn't know a banker or a lawyer who could
sneak them into a corporate pleasure dome between the crab legs and
the Chardonnay. These were the guys who play weekends at Ponky and
The J. These were the kids from the city who can pick one golfer
out of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, they could get within a chip shot of Ty-gah, close
enough for a Kodak moment, close enough to hear his club head
whistle off the tee. ``Amazing,'' said Todd Boulay, after watching
Woods launch an ICBM on 12, the course's toughest hole. ``He just
crushed the ball. He's awesome, that's all there is to it. It's
much more impressive seeing it from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulay had come from Worcester with his friend Wayne Humphrey,
who had gotten two tickets to the whole week through the lottery.
``My mother called me and said, you've got some junk mail here that
says Ryder Cup on it,'' Humphrey said. ``I said, don't throw it
away. I'll be right over.''
</P>
<P>
   Trenton Patterson had no idea he was competing for a place in
the Woods entourage when he wrote a school essay on teamwork. ``I
heard the prize had something to do with golf,'' he shrugged. What
he won was a day at The Country Club for his entire class at
William Barton Rogers Middle School in Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Rickey Woods, who says he's Tiger's cousin ``but he
doesn't know it yet.'' That meant Norman Leitao, who has 45
pictures of Woods in his bedroom. That meant Joe Fitzpatrick,
who'll gladly play alternate shots with Woods if he shows up at the
George Wright.
</P>
<P>
   They may play the game, but none of the rapt faces behind ropes
Wednesday play Tiger's game, with its fearful symmetry. None of
them reach a par 4 in one. None of them dig a ball out of wet rough
with a slick grip and then putt for birdie. None of them can hit a
wedge shot from under a tree and drop it to within 2 feet of the
pin. Not every round. Not every hole.
</P>
<P>
   This was a priceless chance for a free tutorial from a young
master. Watch and learn. ``Day off for you guys?'' someone asked a
threesome from the Foxboro High golf team. ``Well . . .,'' one of
them said.
</P>
<P>
   Just an unscheduled field trip to see Tiger in his natural
habitat. He turned up precisely at 9 for the day's first foursome,
wearing a blue ballcap, cream windbreaker and mocha trousers. ``The
rain'll hold off,'' a hole marshal assured him. ``Yeah,'' Woods
replied dubiously, glancing up at weeping leaden skies.
</P>
<P>
   This was no day for bantering with the gallery. Woods had
twiddled his thumbs behind the Europeans on Tuesday and ended up
hopscotching around the course. Wednesday, he proceeded
purposefully from tee to green, chewing a wad of gum and trying to
avoid pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger, get over here and shake my hand,'' implored Bob
Lavalette, who'd driven down from Burlington, Vt. with his buddies.
Woods kept walking. ``I got shunned by The Man,'' Lavalette
groaned. ``Witnessed by Navin, Madden, and Mahoney,'' one of his
buddies said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal. But this was the back nine and this was
foursome format, with Woods and Steve Pate dueling David Duval and
Phil Mickelson. ``I want to go first,'' Pate informed Woods as they
approached the 10th tee. ``I want you to enjoy some of the places I
see.'' Woods assented, then headed for a porta-potty. Moments
later, Pate was banging on the door. ``Change of plans,'' he told
Woods. ``You're starting.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a 21-year-old rookie two years ago at Valderrama, but
Woods is Da Man this time. He will play all five matches and he
will have a following that will equal Arnie's Army back in the day
and he will hear his name shouted and murmured as it has never been
before _ with a dropped R.

WEB SITE OFFERS A LOOK AT POSTWAR ATOMIC CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, America is under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That, or something like it, was supposed to have been spoken by
Arthur Godfrey in a public service announcement in the 1950s, made
in secret but intended to be broadcast nationwide in the event of
the real thing. You know, kaboom.
</P>
<P>
   No copy of the broadcast, whose history was reported in Time
magazine in 1992, has turned up. If you should find a copy, close
the curtains, stay away from the windows and do NOT look toward the
flash of light. Instead, get in touch with Conelrad
(www.conelrad.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur Godfrey public service announcement is No. 1 on the
hit parade of requests by Conelrad's creators for submissions to
their fledgling site, which promises an overview and a thrillingly
creepy look at America's postwar atomic culture. ``It will be a
permanent and definitive reminder of how pop culture and the Cold
War intersected,'' Bill Geerhart, Conelrad's editor, wrote by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Conelrad, as a baby boomer will be happy to tell you, was the
government's acronym for what became the Emergency Broadcast
System, at 640 and 1240 AM on the radio. Short for Control of
Electromagnetic Radiation, it existed from 1951 to 1963 as a way of
shifting the broadcast frequencies of AM stations to prevent enemy
aircraft from homing in on radio signals for navigation. In the
event of a nuclear attack, those frequencies were where Arthur
Godfrey's message and all other government emergency instructions
were to have been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   This Conelrad Web site _ and remember, this is only a test _
pledges to be short on polemics (there are no discussions of
Communists in the State Department) and long on films, records,
television and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Polemics are hardly needed. The official government advice
speaks for itself, thunderingly obvious and laughably useless.
(``Any shadow will offer protection from searing flash.'') Equally
interesting are the 45-rpm singles titles, like ``Uranium Fever''
(mid-'50s) by Elton Britt, who called himself the world's highest
yodeler, and ``Atomic Cocktail (1945) by Slim Gaillard.
</P>
<P>
   For a much more sobering look at the Cold War's real atomic
victims, the site has a link to the National Association of Atomic
Veterans (www.naav.com), which puts out a quarterly newsletter
about the soldiers who took part in radioactive-weapons tests and
their efforts to get government assistance. (And for more on
Communist espionage, try the National Security Agency's files on
the Venona project, which decoded Soviet messages to their American
spymasters: www.nsa.gov:8080/docs/venona/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Conelrad's television section has summaries of Rod Serling's
still powerful atomic-nightmare episodes from ``Twilight Zone,''
which might be expected. But it also has an offbeat twist on ``I
Dream of Jeannie,'' ``Bewitched'' and ``Mr. Ed'' as responses to
nuclear brinkmanship (the genie is out of the bottle, we have
unleashed special powers, and don't get us started about mutants).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Munsters and the Addamses were the post-nuclear monsters
who literally moved in next door to the Cleavers,'' Geerhart wrote
in an introduction to the television section.
</P>
<P>
   The movie section offers a close look at American
International's ``Panic in Year Zero'' (1962), directed by Ray
Milland. He also stars as a father who responsibly turns the car
radio to Conelrad (the real one) as soon as he sees a mushroom
cloud over Los Angeles. Viewers with Real Video can listen to Les
Baxter's crashing jazz score.
</P>
<P>
   Geerhart said Conelrad was founded this year by three Los
Angeles friends in their mid-30s and 40s: Geerhart, who works for
Citigroup; Curtis Samson, a retired Air Force captain, and Ken
Sitz, who works for Buena Vista's Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are people who were born into the Cold War and continue to
be intrigued by the emerging details of this intense `cool'
conflict,'' Geerhart wrote. ``There isn't a particular political
agenda to the site. Our main goal is to present an entertaining
nonfiction site and generate discussion on our message boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Geerhart promises that Conelrad will soon feature Five-Star
Fallout Shelter, his first-person account of a tour through the
former congressional relocation center that was secretly located
under the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., for 30
years.

COMMENTARY: DARK CLOUDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember my mother coming in from a storm one night many years
ago and telling us, ``You don't want to know what's going on out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   I think there's a tendency to take a similar approach to the
undeniable warming of the earth's oceans and atmosphere, and the
extreme weather events that scientists believe are associated with
it. If you watch television or read the newspapers or step outside
you might begin to think a plague of biblical proportions is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is trying to recover from some of the worst flooding
in its history. And just a month ago New York City was brought to a
virtual standstill when, as reported in The New York Times,
``clouds like those that had merely puckered overhead all summer
suddenly discharged up to four inches of rain in less than three
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, torrential downpours and
flooding, raging forest fires, deadly disease outbreaks _ all
descending on us in frighteningly rapid succession. You can be
forgiven for not wanting to know what's going on out there.
</P>
<P>
   But pull yourself together. This is serious.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, the potentially deadly
viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes, was so unexpected in
New York that doctors at first were unsure of what they were
seeing. But a paper published in March 1998 in the Bulletin of the
American Meteorological Society noted that climate warming and
outbreaks of extreme weather could be expected to have serious
implications for the spread of such diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The paper was titled, ``Biological and Physical Signs of Climate
Change: Focus on Mosquito-Borne Diseases.'' It said, ``Throughout
this century public health researchers have understood that climate
circumscribes the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, while
weather affects the timing and intensity of outbreaks.'' Among the
diseases mentioned in the paper was St. Louis encephalitis, which
has been detected in recent weeks not only in New York City but in
suburban Westchester County and Connecticut as well.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author of the paper was Dr. Paul Epstein, associate
director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at
Harvard Medical School. He stressed in an interview this week that
you cannot say that global warming ``caused'' the outbreak of St.
Louis encephalitis or any other event. But it is known that the
metropolitan area experienced the precise weather conditions
favorable to such an outbreak _ a mild winter (during which some of
the mosquitoes hibernate in the subways, believe it or not)
followed by a very hot and very dry summer (July was the hottest on
record), which encourages breeding, reduces the prevalence of the
mosquitoes' natural predators and speeds up the maturation of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   And those conditions are the ones associated with the climate
change that is believed to be taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Much more serious public health consequences from extreme
weather events have been occurring in developing countries. The
incredible rains and flooding that accompanied Hurricane Mitch,
which killed more than 11,000 people in Central America last year,
led to outbreaks of cholera, malaria, dengue fever and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said it is important to recognize the serious threats to
public health that are among the consequences of climate change and
extreme weather events. That awareness can lead to better
surveillance and earlier and more effective public health
responses.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to public health combined with the enormous economic
costs of these extreme weather events would, if people were
sensible, prompt us to develop environmental and energy policies
designed to alleviate such problems. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   We are learning that ``climate change is not a gradual
process,'' said Epstein. He said he hopes the brutal consequences
of the weather extremes that we are experiencing will ``motivate us
to move toward a transition to clean energy and energy efficiency
in a much more rapid fashion.''

 &HT;    Environmentalists concerned over animal waste in lagoons
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Environmental groups say recent flooding
points up the inherent dangers of storing animal waste in lagoons,
but farmers say the system works fine if they follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental loss ... is staggering,'' said Rick Dove,
who works for the New Bern-based Neuse River Foundation as the
Neuse's ``keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Because lagoons can flood, they shouldn't be built anywhere near
a river or its tributaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been a question of if, it's always been a question
of when,'' he said. ``We don't need to have them in the flood
plain. It doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Smith, president of Rex Smith Farms in Winterville,
said that leaves a big question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which flood plain? The 100-year flood plain? The 500-year
flood plain?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have been scrambling this week to develop
accurate figures on flooded lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Cullom, an environmental specialist in the Washington
office of the state Division of Water Quality, said there are swine
lagoons in Pitt County that flooded as a result of Floyd, but she
did not know exactly how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the farmers have lost their lagoons and their
animals,'' Cullom said.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends rallied to the aid of Rex Smith Farms in
Winterville as floodwaters rose from Contentnea Creek, a tributary
to the Neuse, and threatened the nearly 5,000 hogs in houses about
100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had enough men and boats so all night we got most of them
out,'' said Rex Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest animals were ferried from the stalls to dry ground,
while others were let loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned them right out in the high field,'' Smith said,
adding that water reached five feet in the houses where the animals
are kept.
</P>
<P>
   The farm lost less than 100 hogs in all, not much more than die
in a typical day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buried them 30 feet deep the very same day,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Contentea Creek rose into one waste lagoon and threatened
another one, said Mark Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said current regulations governing the management of
animal waste protect the environment if they're followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the rules,'' he said. ``We like to protect the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hog farms were under water in the Neuse basin, said
Marion Smith, executive director of the Neuse River Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She said a flood of this magnitude is the worst possible
scenario for lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many words for disaster do you know?'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial views reveal ribbons of pink _ the characteristic color
of hog waste _ streaming from lagoons where flood waters barely
cover the pits, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others that are completely submerged are indistinguishable from
the surrounding waters, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding from the Tar River has not been a problem for at least
one Pitt County hog farmer, Charles Gaskins of Black Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just got through pumping my lagoon down where it was
supposed to be (before Floyd struck),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hurricane's torrential rains quickly brought the
levels back up, threatening to break the lagoon walls and prompting
a call to state Division of Water Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me permission to pump it back down,'' Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are not normally allowed to spray lagoon water on
already soaked fields because the waste would run off into ditches,
potentially finding its way into rivers and their tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskins said state regulators preferred to have the waste
released in a controlled manner than to risk a breech in the lagoon
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have long complained that open lagoons pose
a risk of spilling nitrogen-rich waste into waterways. Nitrogen is
a nutrient, and both the Neuse and the Pamlico have been declared
nutrient-sensitive waters by state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping no federal funds will be available for rebuilding
these lagoons in the flood plains,'' said Michelle Nowlin with the
Southern Environmental Law Center in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Smith said he scrupulously monitors the water level in
the farm's lagoons to make sure none of it spills out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy's an old-time fisherman,'' Smith said. ``He knows
what it means to keep clean water.''

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta adds digital gaming
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific-Atlanta will add interactive computer
gaming to its new digital network as part of an ongoing effort to
pump up sales to cable TV operators.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive gaming will be provided by ICTV, which joins 16
other programmers the Duluth-based company has recruited to enhance
its digital system, called Explorer 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta won't sell ICTV's services but instead will
make sure ICTV's games work through Explorer 2000. The company is
betting that services such as interactive gaming will make Explorer
2000 more attractive to cable TV operators trying to reach new
subscribers with new digital services.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV providers are looking for offerings that will tempt
subscribers to sign up for the more expensive digital packages
they're now offering. Typically, digital packages start at about
$10 a month, on top of what subscribers already pay for cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Scientific-Atlanta hopes that ICTV's services
will help cable TV operators with Explorer 2000 sell their new
digital packages to families with children.
</P>
<P>
   The company has licensing deals with computer game giants such
as Acclaim, which makes titles for Nintendo, Sega and Sony
including the sports series NFL Quarterback Club and NBA Jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICTV will offer cable subscribers the ability to experience
full-fledged gaming at incredible cable speeds,'' says Michael P.
Harney, Scientific-Atlanta's corporate vice president and general
manager of its digital subscriber networks unit.
</P>
<P>
   ICTV, based in Silicon Valley, makes applications that include
Internet access, e-mail, a large assortment of CD-ROM games, local
community information, educational content, and transaction
processing for home shopping and banking, games and other software
that can be used via the new digital networks. Among cable
operators building these networks are Atlanta-based Cox
Communications, MediaOne and Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our suite of applications will feature high-resolution video,
complete with 3-D graphics and stereo sound effects,'' said ICTV
President Wes Hoffman. ``Because Scientific-Atlanta has developed a
truly interactive network, based on Internet protocol standards,
we're able to bring a virtual arcade into people's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ICTV's service works through a television connected to a digital
cable network. Users play games against other players with a
wireless keyboard and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta shares closed up 37 1/2 cents at $53.37 1/2.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As I walked through the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas last Friday
afternoon, I spotted a person walking toward me who looked vaguely
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, we made eye contact and I felt a chill knife through
me, as old football memories suddenly flooded across my mental
screen.
</P>
<P>
   This couldn't be the heathen who back in 1987 underpaid the best
running back in the NFL, Eric Dickerson, so scandalously that a
disgruntled Dickerson eventually forced the Los Angeles Rams to
trade him to the Indianapolis Colts, could it?
</P>
<P>
   This couldn't be the Benedict Arnold who was solely responsible
for cleverly orchestrating for Georgia Frontiere the Rams' shocking
move to St. Louis, could it?
</P>
<P>
   This couldn't be Frontiere's heartless financial hitman I once
dubbed as Ram Public Enemy No.1, could it?
</P>
<P>
   ``John Shaw!'' I said, as the president of the St. Louis Rams
moved past me lugging a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, turned around in acknowledgment and broke out in a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you like St. Louis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't L.A.,'' he replied congenially. ``I miss L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like him, despise him or are indifferent to him, the
bottom line with John Shaw is that he's had a colossal impact on
Southern California athletics. The daily soap opera that has become
L.A.'s begging attempt to land an NFL expansion franchise can be
traced to the actions of Shaw, who persuaded Frontiere she could
make a ton of money by moving the Rams to a city willing to forfeit
its financial soul for an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   When the good burghers of St. Louis decided to take such a tack,
Shaw took the Rams to Missouri after the 1994 season, leaving the
L.A. basin wide open for Al Davis and his Raiders. But Davis, in
what has to rank among the most scandalous miscalculations in
sporting history, implausibly decided to return the Raiders to
Oakland, leaving a pro football vacuum here that exists to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' decision made no sense at the time and still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   It would be tantamount to a blackjack player, with a 10 card
showing and an ace in his hand, requesting a hit from the dealer,
or to the L.A. Dodgers deciding to trade perhaps the best hitter in
the history of their franchise and top gate attraction, Mike
Piazza, for Gary Sheffield and a bunch of nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   No one would commit such folly, except, of course, Al Davis, and
those rollicking minstrels who make up the Dodger hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd have known Al were going to move, I'd have found a way
to keep the Rams in Southern California,'' said Shaw. ``I tell you,
we'd have never moved. I still find it hard to believe Al left.''
</P>
<P>
   I myself still find it difficult to comprehend, especially since
Davis was destined to have a stadium built for him at Hollywood
Park and especially since Davis suddenly had this massive area all
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Davis, ever the visionary, found it impossible to
resist an offer from the sterling politicians of Oakland a $34
million low-interest loan to be paid off whenever and renovation of
the Oakland Coliseum and now finds himself in a venue from which he
yearns to extricate himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is recurring speculation that it will be Al Davis' Raiders
who eventually will bring NFL football back to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   While Al Davis is keeping his fingers solemnly crossed in hopes
that happens, there is one severe legal barrier mitigating against
such a development that multi-year stadium lease the Raiders signed
with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic probability is for L.A. to wind up with an
expansion franchise, which the NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue,
wants and which the Coliseum advocates like Mark Ridley-Thomas and
Richard Riordan want even more passionately.
</P>
<P>
   All that has kept the NFL from giving L.A. a team is money, a
lot of it, like that cool $600 million franchise fee that no one
around here seems willing to cough up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised if Marvin Davis decides to do it,'' said
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Davis?
</P>
<P>
   He's the multi-billionaire whose name in recent years inevitably
winds up being linked to almost every high-profile business that's
been put up for sale in America. If Marvin Davis bought up
everything he was rumored to desire, he'd be worth more than Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and I'm sure Marvin Davis is interested in buying
Disney, Viacom, CBS, Chrysler and Microsoft,'' I said to Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I've heard from a couple of owners that he's
serious about wanting an expansion team for L.A. and that he would
be willing to put up his own money,'' said Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Davis willing to put up $600 million of his own money?
</P>
<P>
   That's about as likely to happen as Al Davis being named Man of
the Decade by the L.A. Chamber of Commerce.

 &HT;    Floods create health hazards for residentsd
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE. N.C. _ Flooding from Hurricane Floyd and other
recent rains have created many health hazards, including
bacteria-related diseases, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   People working in floodwaters, returning to flooded homes or
working with machinery increase the risk of cutting themselves and
will need a tetanus shot, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the severe flooding in Grand Forks, N.D., in 1997, a large
majority of the evacuated city and all rescue workers received
tetanus shots, said Dan Shields, Grand Forks public health
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a serious health concern after the flood,'' Shields
said. ``Virtually everyone got a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The other health hazards in the cleanup effort lasting months is
the growth of mold and spores, which causes respiratory conditions.
They can cause complications for people with allergies and asthma,
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a jillion of molds that are going to come up in
(eastern North Carolina),'' said Dr. John Meredith, Pitt County
Memorial Hospital disaster chief.
</P>
<P>
   Another health issue may arise after an infestation of
mosquitoes in the area in the next week, Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a nuisance for people working outside,'' he
said. ``There can literally be a thick swarms of mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is preparing to spray the area for mosquitoes in the
next few weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 1 cause of death after a flood is drowning as people
try to get back to their homes, said Dr. John Morrow, director of
the Pitt County Health Department. The second cause of death after
a flood is electrocution, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said families need to be careful and make sure their
structures in the area are secure and safe before entering because
there could be live wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one needs to risk their lives to go back for material
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need for any special immunizations, other than
tetanus, in the wake of Hurricane Floyd, state and local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``National experience from multiple flood disasters demonstrates
that residents exposed to floodwater are not at a greater risk for
hepatitis A or typhoid fever,'' said State Health Director Dennis
McBride. ``We want to lay this matter to rest. There is no need for
any special immunizations as a result of the severe flooding we've
experienced down east.''
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever is a life-threatening illness caused by the
bacterium Salmonella Typhi. In the U.S., about 400 cases occur each
year, and about 70 percent of these are acquired while traveling
internationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control. You
can get the disease if the bacteria gets into the water used for
drinking or washing food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, this disease has not been associated with floods,''
Shields said. He said his city didn't have any outbreaks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever is more common in areas around the world with less
sanitation or contaminated sewer systems. Symptoms of the disease
include fever, chills, fatigue, cough, headache, sore throat and
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more likely that you won't get diarrhea,'' said Dr.
Christopher Ohl, an associate professor of medicine and infectious
disease with the East Carolina University School of Medicine. ``We
are not anticipating any outbreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The county rescue workers, police, sheriff's deputies and
Greenville Utility employees working in floodwaters received
tetanus shots the last few days as a precaution, said Rick Fisher,
Pitt County Sheriff Department chief of community patrol.
</P>
<P>
   In Grand Forks, about 650 people reported to the local health
department for shots as the cleanup started, Shields said. He said
it is better to be safe and cautious than wait and experience the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sahni said the emergency room has treated minor flood injuries
that will increase as the water recedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not experiencing an increase in skin diseases or rashes
from the flood,'' he said. He said they have had rescue workers and
local residents with fire ant bites and minor snake bites.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitt County Health Department will be giving tetanus shots
to the public today and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes
</P>
<P>
   The large amount of floodwater remaining will lead to an
increase in the already rampant mosquito populations. Mosquitoes
are most active at sunrise and sunset and will be pests. The CDC
says the majority of mosquitoes do not carry communicable diseases
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One health concern officials is the spread of mosquito-related
diseases, including encephalitis, Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be our only concern for the southeast area,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials recommend wearing long sleeves and insect
repellent containing DEET. Also, residents should drain all
standing water in containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been incidents in other floods of up to 20
mosquitoes landing on people in under one minute,'' said Ohl.
</P>
<P>
   Mold growths
</P>
<P>
   Mold can be harmful for adults, children and especially infants.
One mold called stachybotrys chartarum is especially harmful and
takes time to spread and grow.
</P>
<P>
   As it grows, it releases millions of spores into the air that
can attack the lungs, especially in young children and infants.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate cleaning with bleach can help prevent the spread of
all types of mold in homes that have been flooded, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Grand Forks, a city of 50,000, about 450 people experienced
respiratory problems related to mold, Shields said. He said young
children are more susceptible to lung problems related to mold
growths and should be kept away from flooded homes during cleanup
for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clean, sanitize, and dry water-damaged materials as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   All flooded carpets, dry-wall, and some furniture needs to be
thrown away after returning home to prevent mold growths, health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, do not move back into the flooded home until it is
properly cleaned and sanitized, Sahni said.
</P>
<P>
   Stachybotrys is a black slimy mold that only grows in
water-soaked cellulose materials (its food source) such as wood,
paper, ceiling tile and cotton products.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has linked this mold to several cases of infant deaths
diagnosed as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Not all molds are as
deadly as stachybotrys, but many cause heath problems such as
headaches, dizziness, asthma, allergies, as well as other symptom,
said health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mold needs three things to grow and produce spores: air, food
and water _ humidity doesn't count as a water source.

 By THIERRY OGIER 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Luiz Fernando Furlan knows something about
adversity. In the last two years, the chairman of Sadia, Brazil's
leading poultry producer and food processor, has seen important
export markets crumble as major multinationals such as Italy's
Parmalat and France's Doux have invaded his home territory. Now,
with the local market in ruins, he is guardedly optimistic. ``The
moment to pick up the results of our efforts has come,'' Furlan
says.
 &HT;    During the tough times, Furlan hacked costs and trimmed the fat
from Sadia. The workforce was cut by a third to about 22,000
employees and 10 directorships were scrapped. The company also sold
more than half of the firm's soybean-crushing plants in December
1997 to U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland for $165 million. Last
year, the efforts paid off. The company almost tripled profits to
US$143 million even as sales plummeted by almost 20 percent to $2.2
billion. ``Our fixed costs have come down and we have greater
efficiency,'' says Furlan.
 &HT;    Now, Sadia is counting on its lean-mean operations to fly hard
and fast straight into economic uncertainty. Exports will get a
boost from Brazilian currency devaluation and provide a natural
hedge to what promises to be a tough year at home.
 &HT;    During the years of a strong currency, many Brazilian companies
stopped pushing exports and focused on the rapidly expanding local
market. Not Sadia. Exports, which represent about a fifth of the
company's total sales, were projected at $350 million last year,
but topped $400 million. With the maxi-devaluation of the real, the
company expects to increase overseas sales another 10 percent this
year.
 &HT;    After nearly getting plucked in the Thai devaluation in 1997 and
again with the Russian ruble collapse last year, Sadia is a tough
international operator. It exports to 50 countries. Almost half its
exports go to the Middle East, followed by Europe (19 percent) and
Asia (15 percent). The foreign markets are a ``natural hedge''
toward paying the company's debt, says Sadia's financial director
Luiz Murat. Indeed, much of the company's export sales are tied to
foreign credits to reduce financing costs.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Duff &AMP; Phelps and other international credit rating
agencies are keeping a close eye on the poultry producer because of
its large short-term debts, some $468 million in all. ``An economic
slowdown may negatively impact on its cash flow,'' warns Duff &AMP;
Phelps in a recent report. The company's recently launched
ready-to-eat and frozen foods will probably be hardest hit by the
crisis. Sadia has introduced more than 30 new products each year
since 1997 in a bid to move into foods with higher margins than
chicken and turkey. With the severe economic downturn, though,
products like chicken Parmesan and pizzas are liable to be the
first to be erased from consumers' shopping lists.
 &HT;    ``Sadia has focused on frozen food but has not given up on other
products,'' says Andreia Teixeira, an analyst at investment bank
Bozano Simonsen in Rio de Janeiro. ``Poultry and pork products are
less affected by the economic downturn.''
 &HT;    In these products, Sadia is facing some tough competition. The
Italian conglomerate Parmalat, which has already bought two local
companies, has announced it is going to enter the turkey business
next Christmas. The French company Doux is competing on the chicken
front, after the acquisition of Sadia rival Frangosul last year.
And perhaps worst of all, mom-and-pop production is expected to
increase as people seek to supplement incomes selling homegrown
chickens on the side. ``The worst competition is not Doux or
others, but it is rather the informal sector,'' says Teixeira.
 &HT;    Having weathered economic turmoil on three continents, if the
worst this year has in store for Sadia is playing chicken with
black-market birds, Chairman Furlan has reason to be optimistic.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Opening ceremonies for the Ryder Cup,
including the announcement of Friday morning's pairings, will be
held at 4:30 p.m. Thursday on the practice range at The Country
Club. Entertainment, highlighted by singer Glen Frey, will begin at
3:30. The ceremonies will feature a procession of national flags
carried by West Point cadets, the playing of anthems by members of
the Boston Pops, the introduction of the 12-man teams from the US
and Europe, speeches by the captains, and a flyover (at
approximately 5:15) by Navy F-14 Tomcats from Squadrons 32 and 213.

   US captain Ben Crenshaw said his toughest decision will be to
sit four players for the first four groups of matches. ``I said
before I didn't think it was plausible or possible that 12 fellows
could be playing well at one time,'' said Crenshaw. ``We had a few
pairings today I wanted to see work together. The problem I have
right now is leaving four guys out the first day because I feel a
lot of guys are playing well.'' And the prospects of Tiger Woods
and David Duval in one pairing? ``It's certainly a possibility,''
said Crenshaw. ``For months and months, I've struggled with the
round. You take four or five of our best players and you can either
put them together or split them throughout the lineup. Those are
the things you wrestle with. It's very safe to say that both of
them are going to play a lot but, at this point, I don't think that
it's going to happen in the first match. I don't know if you're
going to see that pairing in the first round.''

   Even as the doctor was treating the pinched nerve in his neck,
Davis Love could think about nothing but playing in the Ryder Cup.
``I said, `I'm going to be ready for this Ryder Cup. If this is the
only thing I do the rest of the year, I'm going to play,' '' said
Love. ``I knew if I did what the doctor said, I would be ready. I
was going to actually give up going fishing to play in this Ryder
Cup and that's a big sacrifice. I think that helped me when I first
started hitting balls again. I'd been thinking every day, I'm going
to be ready for this Ryder Cup no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   His recovery has been slow but Love is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The pinched nerve) led to me kind of losing some feeling in
my fingers in my left hand and losing some strength,'' he said. ``I
was told I needed to take two to three weeks off to let it get
better. I started back hitting balls last Friday. I'd be lying if I
said I'm 100 percent, but I'm probably 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting the ball as good or better than I have all year.
As long as I don't do anything to reinjure it, I think I'm in very
good shape and I'm excited about the way I'm hitting it. I've never
really come back hitting the ball this good from a layoff. I was
having problems that were affecting my swing. Now they've gone away
and my swing's getting better. I may have have lost a little bit of
length with the driver, but maybe the length will come back a
little bit.

 &HT;    Greenville area restaurants, businesses reopen
 &HT;    By Stuart Savage
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Many businesses, including banks and
restaurants, were open in Greenville on Wednesday after Hurricane
Floyd caused interruptions due to the lack of electric power and a
lack of running water.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitt County Health Department's environmental health
division ordered restaurants to close Tuesday when the water
pressure in areas dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Weathersby, a supervisor with the county's
environmental health division, said Greenville area restaurants
were notified that they could reopen Wednesday, provided they had
water pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get any pressure up, they can operate,'' Weathersby
said. ``As long as they have running water under pressure. And they
have to have pressure on the toilets or Portajohns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be cleaning pots, pans, dishes, you have to
have pressure and hot water. If you don't have that, you can't
sanitize food contact surfaces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weathersby said if the water is contaminated, restaurants can't
use it for cooking unless they boil it for five or six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of precautions, especially when the pressure is
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weathersby, the health department is using the
honor system with restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pressure drops to a trickle, they have to shut down,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to restaurants, The Plaza mall and Carolina East
Mall, with the exception of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., were closed
Wednesday because of the lack of water and restroom facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But a visual survey of several areas indicated that many other
businesses were open.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    ACNielsen to buy 10% of NetRatings
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ACNielsen, the world's top media research company,
will buy 10 percent of NetRatings for $12.5 million and form a
joint venture to measure Internet traffic around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be called ACNielsen eRating.com and will
track Internet and Web usage from users in Europe, Asia, Latin
America, Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's international venture is aimed at helping close the
gap with New York and Atlanta-based Media Metrix, now widely
accepted as the industry standard for Web measurement. Nielsen and
NetRatings, which currently collaborate to provide Web tracking
services in the U.S., said they plan to spend $50 million over the
next two years to get the international version of
Nielsen/NetRatings service up and running. The goal of the new
company is to establish itself as the Web measurement company of
record outside the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ACNielsen will own 80 percent of ACNielsen eRating.com, while
closely held Stamford, Conn.-based NetRatings will own 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nielsen/NetRatings, which launched earlier this year
offers a comprehensive suite of measurement services for its
clients, they still run second to Media Metrix. Media Metrix, which
merged with Atlanta-based Relevant Knowledge in 1998 has been
watching Web traffic since 1996. Jupiter Communications analyst
Michele Flack says Nielsen/NetRatings' move into the international
arena is a smart move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a greater and greater interest in international
markets,'' she says. ``The Internet has been dominate in the U.S.,
but there has been a great increase in Australia, Europe, the
Pacific Rim and Latin America in terms of how fast people are
coming online.''
</P>
<P>
   Flack says if Nielsen/NetRatings can move quickly into overseas
markets and establish itself as the No. 1 Web measurement firm, it
could help their own battle with Media Metrix stateside.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a new player in the Web measurement field,
Nielsen/NetRatings is off to a good start, providing clients with
near-overnight information on Web events such as tracking Web usage
for the four days Hurricane Floyd swept up the East Coast and
analyzing the Web buzz generated by the surprise summer movie hit
``The Blair Witch Project.'' Nielsen can also deliver advertising
information and reports on how much time users spend on a site,
which is becoming more and more important as commercial Web sites
compete not just for users but for their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nielsen does some really cool things,'' Flack says.
``Especially it reports showing where your competitors are
advertising. They do deliver above and beyond what Media Metrix
delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Media Metrix doesn't offer advertiser reports or the
near instant analysis of Web usage, it does offer the all-important
workplace sample which Nielsen maintains cannot be measured
accurately. Still, with more and more users logging on at work, the
need for some measurement standard in the workplace is as vital as
advertising information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the typical follower dilemma,'' Flack says. ``When
something is the standard it's hard to come in and play catch up.
If Nielsen can get out there in the international market and become
the international standard, Media Metrix will have to catch up with
them. It will also help them in the national U.S. market as well.
Their measurement system may solidify their standard in the U.S.
and bolster it,'' Flack said. ``If people get used to
Nielsen/NetRatings for international ratings, they might not be so
wedded to Media Metrix in the U.S.''

CHURCH SHOOTING SEEN AS LATEST IN WAVE OF HATE CRIMES AGAINST
CHRISTIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The seven slain worshippers at Wedgwood Baptist
Church have become a rallying point for evangelical Christians who
view them as the latest victims in a wave of hate crimes against
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   A host of Christian conservative leaders have cited the Sept. 15
shootings as evidence of a climate of hatred against believers. The
Fort Worth incident was the third recent mass shooting targeting
youthful Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real hostility today, the real hate crimes, are against
people of faith,'' said the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a prominent
evangelist. ``I believe the worst is yet to come. There will be
other incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Falwell and his allies of trying to exploit the
slayings for political reasons. Peter Montgomery of People for the
American Way, a liberal organization, said talk of anti-Christian
hatred is a recurring theme among religious right activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so far beyond reason when you look around this
country. Most Americans are Christians,'' Montgomery said. ``I
think they're trying, for political reasons, to equate criticism of
their political agenda with anti-Christian hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that Christians are under attack is coupled with a
belief among some Christian conservatives that the Fort Worth
shootings have failed to provoke the kind of national outrage that
followed last year's killings of James Byrd in East Texas and
Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, an African American, was dragged behind a pickup. Shepard,
a homosexual, was beaten and left tied to a fence in freezing
weather. In Fort Worth, gunman Larry Gene Ashbrook, killed seven
worshippers and wounded seven others before sitting down in a pew
and killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lesser crime to shoot up a church. The media doesn't
see the church and the gospel and all that it has stood for as
being valid,'' said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the
Traditional Values Coalition, an organization that claims 43,000
member churches. ``To me, there's no question this was a hate crime
against righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Christian right movement agreed that the Fort
Worth shootings qualify as a hate crime, but they disputed
assertions that the church deaths were quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the argument that there's less outrage than there
was in regard to Matthew's murder or James Byrd's murder,'' said
David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the
nation's largest gay rights group. ``The country is shellshocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most news reports have characterized the Fort Worth
slayings as an isolated incident involving a troubled loner,
Falwell and other evangelical leaders see it in the context of
other shootings that claimed the lives of active Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a gunman killed three teenagers and wounded five other
participants in a prayer group at Heath High School in West
Paducah, Ky. Anti-Christian bias also seemed to have played a role
in the April shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In the most widely known incident, Cassie Bernall, a born-again
Christian, was shot after saying ``yes'' when one of the gunmen
asked her if she believed in God. Falwell said 11 of the 12
shooting victims at the school were evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said
the Fort Worth shootings should erase any doubt that Christians
have become a prime target for hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of a
recognition that there's a pattern of violence against
Christians,'' he said. ``What's going on is Christians are being
painted as bigots and haters and some people are taking it to heart
and attacking Christians as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight also accused the media of downplaying the Fort Worth
shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a smug satisfaction in some parts of the
media that, gee, the Christians are getting theirs,'' he said.
``The media have been almost silent as to the motive of the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said he is convinced that the Fort Worth case would have
attracted far more attention if the victims had been homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had those seven students at Wedgwood Baptist Church been gay
or lesbian we wouldn't have been able to get a weather report on
any station. But because they were Christians, it was treated as no
big deal,'' he said, adding that the incident has become ``just a
blip'' in history.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth leaders disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said on Wednesday that the
shooting was far more that a historical footnote to the people of
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal here,'' Barr said. ``People in this
community are grieving about what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Mr. Falwell is entitled to his opinion, but I am
frankly not concerned about what \Rhe\S thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that he doesn't know whether the shootings at Wedgwood
Baptist fit the standard definition of hate crime, but that that is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what does it matter?'' Barr said. ``The point is that
good, religious people, who were making a difference in the
community, and living out their lives, are needlessly dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to sit down and try to figure out what can be
done so hopefully this will not happen again, no matter who the
target is.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the Fort Worth shootings meet the
definition of a hate crime because the assailant seemed to target
his victims for their religious beliefs. Under federal law, crimes
motivated by race, religion, national origin and ethnicity can be
considered hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The designation can trigger FBI involvement in the investigation
and tougher penalties in the event of a conviction. Both
possibilities are moot in the Fort Worth case since the shooter
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, who was reared in a devoutly Christian home, ripped
the pages from a Bible in his home before setting off on his
shooting spree. He denounced religion and ridiculed his victims for
their beliefs as he sprayed the church with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood, this is a hate crime. The victims were
targeted because they were in a church and because they were
Christians,'' said Jack Levin, a hate crimes expert at Northeastern
University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But becoming the victim of hate crimes has not altered the view
among Christian conservatives that the entire concept of hate
crimes is wrong. Evangelical leaders steadfastly oppose efforts in
Congress to expand crimes motivated by sexual orientation to the
list of possible hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole hate crime concept is wrongheaded,'' Knight said.
``I might feel it was particularly odious to attack a house of
worship, but in the eyes of the law, we should all be entitled to
equal protection.'' Staff writer Ginger D. Richardson contributed
to this report.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brasil _ Luiz Fernando Furlan sabe algo de
adversidades. En los ultimos dos anos, el presidente de Sadia, el
principal procesador de alimentos y productor avicola de Brasil, ha
visto derrumbarse importantes mercados de exportacion mientras
grandes multinacionales, como la italiana Parmalat y la francesa
Doux, han invadido su territorio. ``Ha llegado el momento de
recoger los frutos de nuestro esfuerzo,'' afirma Furlan.
 &HT;    En los tiempos dificiles, Furlan disminuyo costos y aumento la
eficiencia de Sadia. La fuerza laboral se redujo en una tercera
parte, a unos 22.000 empleados, y se eliminaron 10 direcciones. La
compania tambien vendio mas de la mitad de las plantas trituradoras
de soya en diciembre de 1997 a la firma estadounidense Archer
Daniels Midland por US$165 millones. El ano pasado, esa estrategia
dio frutos. La epresa casi triplico sus ganancias a US$143
millones, aun cuando las ventas bajaron casi el 20 por ciento, a
US$2.200 millones. ``Nuestros costos fijos han bajado y tenemos mas
eficiencia,'' dice Furlan.
 &HT;    Ahora, Sadia cuenta con esa mayor eficiencia para capear el
temporal de la incertidumbre economica. Las exportaciones recibiran
un impulso debido a la devaluacion del real y compensaran lo que
promete ser un ano dificil para el pais.
 &HT;    Durante los anos en que la moneda mantuvo su fortaleza, muchas
companias brasilenas perdieron interes en las exportaciones y se
concentraron en el mercado nacional, que crecia rapidamente. Pero
no Sadia. Las exportaciones, que representan aproximadamente la
quinta parte del total de ventas de la compania, se proyectaron en
US$350 millones el ano pasado, pero superaron los US$400 millones.
Con la maxidevaluacion del real, la compania espera incrementar
este ano las ventas en el extranjero en el 10 por ciento.
 &HT;    Despues que casi quedo desplumada cuando la devaluacion de
Tailandia en 1997 y luego con el colapso del rublo el ano pasado,
Sadia mantiene una fuerte presencia internacional: exporta a 50
paises. Casi la mitad de sus exportaciones van hacia el Medio
Oriente, seguido por Europa (19 por ciento) y Asia (15 por ciento).
Los mercados extranjeros son una ``cobertura natural'' para que la
compania pueda pagar su deuda, dice Luiz Murat, director de
finanzas de Sadia. En efecto, gran parte de las exportaciones de la
empresa estan vinculadas a creditos extranjeros para reducir los
costos de financiamiento.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Duff &AMP; Phelps y otras entidades internacionales de
calificacion de credito no le quitan la vista de encima al
productor avicola debido a sus grandes deudas a corto plazo, US$468
millones en total. ``Una retraccion economica puede tener un efecto
negativo en su flujo de caja,'' advierte Duff &AMP; Phelps en un
reciente informe.
 &HT;    Probablemente los productos congelados y listos para comer que
la compania lanzo recientemente sean los mas afectados por la
crisis. Sadia ha lanzado anualmente mas de 30 productos desde 1997,
con el proposito de pasar a renglones alimenticios que den mas
ganancia que el pollo y el pavo. Pero ante la grave contraccion
economica, productos como el pollo parmesano y las pizzas deben ser
los primeros en desaparecer de las listas de compra de los
consumidores.
 &HT;    ``Sadia se ha concentrado en los alimentos congelados pero no ha
abandonado otros productos,'' dice Andreia Teixeira, analista del
banco de inversion Bozano Simonsen, en Rio de Janeiro. ``La crisis
economica afecta menos al pollo y al cerdo.''
 &HT;    En estos productos, Sadia afronta una fuerte competencia. El
conglomerado italiano Parmalat, que ya ha comprado dos companias
brasilenas, anuncio su entrada en el negocio del pavo para esta
Navidad. La compania francesa Doux compite en el sector del pollo
desde que adquirio Frangosul, rival de Sadia, el ano pasado. Y
quiza lo peor de todo: se espera que la produccion casera se
incremente porque muchas personas trataran de complementar sus
ingresos criando pollos para venderlos. ``La peor competencia no es
de Doux ni de otras empresas, sino del sector informal,'' senala
Teixeira.
 &HT;    Despues de capear la tempestad economica en tres continentes, si
lo peor que este ano le depara a Sadia es la competencia con el
mercado negro, el presidente de la empresa, Furlan, tiene motivos
para sentirse optimista.

 &HT;    Technology hot again in investment advice
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investment advice from the latest batch of business
publications has a decidedly high-tech ring.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (October) looks at the ``Internet stars of the
future,'' suggesting that the latest Internet sell-off is ``another
buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says these Web stocks are worth considering:
Amazon.com, Ariba, eBay, Exodus, Inktomi, Red Hat Software and
Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance (October) also looks at tech stocks
and finds that Dell Computer ranks first in ``wealth creation'' by
generating the most value for shareholders. Others in the top five
are Yahoo!, Infoseek, Microsoft and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (October) takes a look at
real estate investment trusts and finds that, after taking a
beating, ``they're poised for a comeback.'' The REITs it recommends
are Apartment Investment and Management, Chelsea GCA, Equity Office
Properties, General Growth Properties and Spieker Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds (October) puts a microscope on mutual fund families
_ companies that offer a broad menu of mutual funds _ and concludes
that Fidelity, with almost $800 billion in assets, is the best.
Others include Janus, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   A tiger by the tail
</P>
<P>
   Why can't everybody be happy in a booming economy in which
profits are soaring? Because of ``the prosperity gap,'' says
Business Week (Sept. 27). That's the gap between what workers make
in the ``new economy'' _ built on computers, software and
communications _ compared to wages in the ``old economy'' _ focused
on construction, education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a happy situation and will get even worse the next time
the economy takes a dip, Business Week says. One result could be
the creation of new, fringe political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as movements in continents produce earthquakes and
volcanoes, so will the growing prosperity gap create social
upheaval for years to come,'' says the magazine. ``We will be
riding this tiger for years to come.''

 FLORIDA ACCUSES   PUBLISHERS CLEARING HOUSE OF DECEPTIVE
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Publishers Clearing House, one of the two largest
sweepstakes companies, was accused Wednesday in a civil suit filed
by Florida's attorney general of using deceptive practices to sell
magazines and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that the company's mailings were designed to
entice people to make purchases by fooling them into thinking they
had won millions of dollars and that the company focused on older
people, who often misunderstand its sophisticated mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   One technique singled out was the company's highly publicized
Prize Patrol, which delivers multimillion-dollar prizes to winners.
The suit said the company's request, in mailings, for specific
directions to customers' houses for the Prize Patrol gave hundreds
of thousands of people the illusion that they had won.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in Pinellas County Circuit Court in Tampa, seeks
at least $40 million in restitution for customers and civil
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is the fifth state to sue Publishers Clearing House,
which is based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher L. Irving, the company's director of consumer
affairs, said that its mailings were not deceptive, that they
stated clearly the odds of winning and that no purchase was
necessary to win. Irving also said that mailings said clearly that
the odds of the Prize Patrol coming to the letter recipient's house
were very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers understand that a mailing from Publishers Clearing
House is an opportunity to enter a sweepstakes and that no purchase
is necessary,'' Irving said.
</P>
<P>
   The sweepstakes industry sells millions of dollars worth of
magazines and merchandise every year through mass mailings
containing attention-grabbing graphics and language designed to get
recipients to buy magazines and other merchandise and enter a
sweepstakes contest. In smaller print, the mailings specify that no
purchase is necessary to enter the contest and that the odds of
winning are very long.
</P>
<P>
   But the contents of those mailings have been challenged as
misleading and deceptive on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation that
would impose new restrictions on sweepstakes companies as well as
stiffer penalties for fraudulent mailings. The legislation calls
for printing clearly and conspicuously that winning is not
automatic and that buying merchandise does not improve the very
long odds of winning. Backers of the legislation hope the House
will also approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have used consumer-protection
laws to go after the sweepstakes business. Last May, Florida and
three other states settled similar complaints with American Family
Publishers, the other leading sweepstakes company. As part of that
settlement, American Family Publishers paid $4 million and promised
to stop telling recipients of its mailings that they are winners
unless it is true.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Publishers Clearing House was filed after a
breakdown in negotiations between the office of Attorney General
Robert Butterworth of Florida and lawyers for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months of negotiations with Publishers Clearing House have
failed to produce any meaningful changes to the deceptive
solicitations mailed out by the company,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said an agreement with Florida had been within reach. He
also said that Publishers Clearing House had voluntarily taken
steps to remove high-volume customers from its mailing list and
added information to its mailings emphasizing that recipients had
not yet won.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly say an older person can often spend
thousands of dollars buying unneeded magazines and other
merchandise in order to enter sweepstakes and similar contests
because they are fooled into thinking they are going to win or have
won.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Wright, who lives in Lauderhill, Fla., said his
great-aunt had squandered her life savings of $87,000 over the last
three years buying unnecessary merchandise from Publishers Clearing
House and entering Canadian lotteries pushed by telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still says that she's on the next step to be the winner,''
Wright said. ``It's so sad because she would rather send in checks
than pay for her medication.''

A TORTURED SOUL SINGS ITS LAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telling moment of Trent Reznor's life of pain and music, and
his intertwining of the two, unfolded three years ago in Dallas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know, goes away, in the end,'' he murmured from the
stage at Fair Park Coliseum during the cryptic ``Hurt,'' while
portraits of a rotting animal carcass flashed across a screen and
lights turned from hopeful white to sea-of-blood red.
</P>
<P>
   It was a desperate and beautiful moment, an image of an
unimaginably tortured person trapped inside a pretty melody.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Reznor _ the one-man-band behind industrial
juggernaut Nine Inch Nails _ has been turning his
perhaps-autobiographical tales of splintered relationships, fury,
loneliness, alienation and disappointment into art of the highest
form: It's believable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so many young fans fell in love with NIN, because
Reznor was living proof that they're not the only ones trying to
survive one trauma after another. NIN definitely attracted its
share of bandwagon-jumpers. But there's a circle of fans that can
truly relate to Reznor, who once said one of the greatest things a
fan ever said to him was, ``Your music makes me feel like I'm not
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Fragile,'' NIN's first effort in five years and
first-ever double CD, Reznor is alone again, questioning, doubting,
distrusting everyone and everything. ``Everything that swore it
wouldn't change is different now,'' he bellows on the first track,
the raging Somewhat Damaged. ``I'm too ------ up to care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the two discs, Reznor continually second-guesses _
himself, those close to him, those he wants close to him, those who
want to get away from him. It's not all self-pity, though: The
album's title track is about saving someone from ending up like
him. ``I won't let you fall apart,'' Reznor sings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the musical landscape has considerably changed since
NIN's first disc, 1989's ``Pretty Hate Machine,'' Reznor has
changed little. He still saturates his songs equally with gritty
noise (distorted vocals, ferocious guitars, hammering drums) and
ambient sound waves. He's one of the few artists who realize that
the rage of noise can be just as effective as the subtleties of
silence _ and he's a master at manipulating both.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike far too many other two-CD collections, this one has
little filler material. The songs are spliced like chapters in a
book, each one segueing into the other, elegantly shifting from
stormy to quiet. But the lyrics remain Reznor's strong point.
``Tried to save myself,'' he laments on ``Into the Void,'' ``but
myself keeps slipping away.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ For all its saturated misery, this city has a
group of sweaty and sleepless heroes: the civil engineers and
laborers, even prison inmates, who worked frantically for the last
week on precarious schemes to keep electricity and tap water
flowing through the greatest flood in state history.
</P>
<P>
   If the desperate methods concocted by Malcolm A. Green and his
crew at Greenville Utilities had failed _ and they came within 2
inches of calamity _ there probably would have been no electricity
for the city's 55,000 residents for a long time to come. The city's
water supply _ now barely returning to normal after being out for
most of Tuesday _ would have been out for weeks. Greenville would
have been unlivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe how close we came to disaster,'' said
Green, the general manager of the utility, as an aide brought in an
armful of crayoned thank-you notes from schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous rush of water that Hurricane Floyd produced
throughout eastern North Carolina, which has now killed 41 people
and made 6,000 homeless, has created havoc with the most
fundamental utilities of modern life. Repair crews are accustomed
to fixing power lines blown down by high winds, but are they
virtually helpless when entire substations and waterworks become
submerged. Some pumping and power stations have been ruined by the
water and will have to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 people around the state have been without power
for most of a week. One lineman has already died, and another was
injured trying to restore power in the southern part of the state.
More than 40,000 customers in at least five counties either have no
water or must boil their tap water because of contamination. In
Duplin County, southwest of here, the flood has damaged
distribution pipes in more than 50 places. County officials say it
could be days or weeks before normal service is restored, because
crews cannot even get close to all the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville has been one of the hardest-hit cities in the state,
because the Tar River runs directly through the middle of town. The
northern and southern sections of the city are cut from each other,
and 3,000 city residents have been forced from their homes to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Because it uses the Tar River as its source for drinking water,
the city's water plant is located near it, and the power substation
is similarly near the middle of town for ease in transmission. Both
facilities are on 100-year flood plains, high enough to withstand
floods so severe that they would occur only once a century. But
with the current flood considered to be a 500-year flood, higher
than any ever recorded, the utilities' locations near the Tar meant
that they were among the first casualties.
</P>
<P>
   All of the city's electrical power flows through the main
substation, a maze of transformers and wires. When the water began
pouring in on Saturday, Green knew he could not save the circuit
breakers that act as safety devices in case of overloads. But with
power still in the lines, he devised a plan to use a circuit
breaker outside the station, which posed significant risks to the
city's transmission system.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme would only work, however, if the water stayed
underneath the main cables, which carry 230,000 volts. The utility
stationed a man in a boat at the station to call in with constant
reports on the water level. If it approached the wires, Green would
order all power to the city cut off. If it touched the wires, it
would create a short circuit and arcing that could destroy the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole city was on pins and needles all weekend,'' said
Green, following along on radio and television as the utility
waited to see whether the system would hold together. The water
edged up to within 2 inches of a blackout. Wildlife officials had
to keep sightseers from the area, worried that their boats and jet
skis could create a wave that would touch the wires. An oil slick
moving downstream created fears of a conflagration, but the utility
quickly created a floating boom to move it away.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, as if held together by chewing gum, the electrical
system has worked for five days. But meanwhile, the utility's water
plant was also becoming submerged.
</P>
<P>
   The utility mobilized a small army of city workers and prisoners
in detention centers to begin filling 25,000 sandbags, which were
themselves an ordeal to find and fly in by military helicopters.
The bags formed a 6-foot wall around the most crucial areas of the
water plant, and though the flood crept inside, the pumps never
fully stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But the filters that keep sediment out of the drinking water
quickly became clogged, because the high water outside prevented
them from being flushed and drained. By Tuesday, the water was
moving so slowly through the filters that most of the town in
effect had no water pressure, and there were fears that the whole
city would be unable to bathe. Two shelters housing 3,000 people
were evacuated, restaurants and businesses closed, and many
residents prepared to move out.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, however, the engineers at the utility had
devised yet another jerry-built system to clean the filters with a
maze of plastic pipes. Extra-chlorinated water began flowing, first
into homes in low-lying areas, and then up the incline to the
higher areas south of town. Green himself had his first shower in
several days on Wednesday, all the while worrying that the water
pressure was too low to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the utility pulls its water from the lower part
of the riverbed, which is generally free of most of the
contaminants floating on top, the water is not considered safe to
drink. Residents are required to boil their tap water before
drinking it, and thousands lined up for free gallons of bottled
water being distributed by McDonald's and other companies at points
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got a trickle of water, and I'm old enough not to
mind heating it up on the stove to take a bath,'' said Sylvia
Corey, who lives in the Westhaven neighborhood on the south side.
``But I've been watching Green on TV, and I know we are lucky to
have what we've got.''

 &HT;    Dell launches ads to push PCs targeted at consumers
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Until recently, Dell Computer Corp. considered
most consumers to be more trouble than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   The company was content to focus on large accounts in business
and government that ordered PCs by the hundreds or thousands, and
didn't require a lot of costly technical help.
</P>
<P>
   But changes in Dell's approach to customer support and
burgeoning consumer interest in the Internet have helped turn
around the company's view of that market.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dell announced its broadest effort to capture
consumer business by backing what it calls ``the most
consumer-friendly PCs'' with a major U.S. advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which include a PC ``juke box'' system that allows
users to create CDs of their favorite music, and portables in gray
or blue, will be available beginning this weekend, when Dell's
advertising campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Mountain, general manager of Dell's consumer business,
said its so-called Dell4Me program marks a shift to emphasizing
what technology offers rather than merely touting products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to do is to be much more explicit about letting
consumers see how they're going to use technology in such a way
that brings benefit to them,'' Mountain said during a press
conference in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said it is the first major computer maker to offer PCs with
cable modems, a feature that will be available in limited areas
where Excite(at)Home offers cable access to the Internet. In
addition, Dell will sign customers up for the high-speed Internet
service. Dell also said a new Inspiron model will be available in
grey and blue, taking a lesson from Apple Computer Inc.'s success
with multicolored iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's courtship of consumers in recent months has included
Internet access through DellNet, while DellAuction.com, lets
customers buy and sell used and refurbished Dell PCs. These
features make the consumer business more attractive because
Internet access brings Dell monthly revenue, while the auction and
Gigabuys.com, Dell's online PC product store, expand sales
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's overriding goal is to be the source of all its customers'
computing needs and to build customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's consumer sales doubled in the past year, they still
account for only 15 percent of revenue. Dell ranks fourth in the
consumer business, according to research group Ziff Davis
Infobeads.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kay, an analyst with the Boston-area research firm
International Data Corp., said research in Japan shows Dell is
perceived as efficient but impersonal _ a perception that may be
tough to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``To deal with consumers, they have to slow down and be sort of
friendly,'' said Kay.

MORE AND MORE, PUBLIC SCHOOLS DRAW THE ATTENTION OF BIG-NAME
DONORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long dismissed as the runts in the family of philanthropy,
public schools and their students are getting fresh attention from
high-profile donors plainly concerned about the nation's academic
future.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than donating only to their college alma maters, the
wealthy givers _ including George Lucas, the filmmaker, Theodore J.
Forstmann, the Wall Street financier and Leonard Riggio, the
chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble _ are increasingly bestowing their
largess on those individuals struggling just to make it through
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Their gifts were trumped last week by a $1 billion scholarship
program for disadvantaged minority students announced by Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, Eli Broad, chairman of Sun America, a Los
Angeles-based financial services company, said he was setting aside
$100 million for urban school systems, primarily to help train
superintendents, principals and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Though the motives vary, the thread through all of these gifts
is a conviction that government has been unwilling, or perhaps
unable, to rescue the public education system and its students.
Moreover, many of the donors believe that the success of their
businesses _ the source of their wealth _ hinges on an educated
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the national community has realized it isn't enough
just to give to higher education,'' said Eugene Lang, who may have
sowed the seeds of this movement when he adopted 54 sixth-graders
at a Harlem, N.Y., school in 1981 and committed to send them to
college. ``You've got to catch children before they fall into that
abyss,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Though gifts to universities show no sign of abating _ an annual
survey tallied $18.4 billion in donations to higher education last
school year, a record _ fund-raising consultants say that the
broader spectrum of educational institutions, including elementary
and secondary schools, have begun to attract the very rich.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the donations have been driven by the need for a
helping hand: Long seen as the responsibility of taxpayers, the
problems and demands of the nation's public school students
increasingly seem to be too overwhelming for government to address.
At a time when politicians are unwilling to raise school budgets,
and Congress is demanding a deep tax cut, the wish lists of
principals have never been longer: Billions of dollars have been
requested to buy computers, reduce class sizes, retrain teachers
and, perhaps most important, close the gap between rich and poor
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a large, intractable problem that our government and
public institutions can't solve alone,'' said Nancy Raybin, a
management consultant who specializes in nonprofit institutions.
``We're seeing the philanthropists trying to get the money to
organizations and individuals directly, without too much
bureaucracy in between.''
</P>
<P>
   In committing to provide $1 billion in college scholarships to
the neediest high-school seniors over 20 years _ with hopes of
subsidizing at least 1,000 students a year _ Gates and his wife,
Melinda, chose to do so not through a university or a group of
universities but through the United Negro College Fund, along with
the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the American Indian College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   By identifying talented but needy students before they reach
college, Gates is following Lang, whose idea has been replicated in
64 other cities through the I Have a Dream Foundation, and Walter
H. Annenberg, whose contributions to public education have exceeded
$800 million since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by many others.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, the financier, last year committed $50 million to a
$200 million effort that would permit at least 40,000 inner-city
public-school children to attend parochial and other private
schools over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Broad of Sun America, who had previously contributed to
Forstmann's private voucher program, said that almost all of his
latest donation, the $100 million that he committed this week,
would go to public schools. He said he had not yet decided how the
money would be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The George Lucas Educational Foundation, founded by the creator
of ``Star Wars,'' has spent $10 million since 1991 to help
elementary and secondary school teachers find creative ways to
teach students, largely through film and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio, the chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, convened a campaign last
year to raise $10 million for Brooklyn Technical High School, the
public school from which he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   And expanding a program that they began a decade ago, Michael
Milken, the Wall Street financier who was convicted of securities
fraud, and his brother, Lowell, will award $25,000 grants to 172
elementary and secondary school teachers next month _ bringing to
nearly $40 million the amount that the Milken Family Foundation has
given to teachers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like Gates, who said he wanted to demonstrate that ``private
philanthropy can be part of making sure there is equal
opportunity,'' each donor has entered the educational arena for
particular reasons _ reasons that don't include having their names
emblazoned on a college library (though in some cases, like Gates',
the scholarships will bear the names of the donors).
</P>
<P>
   In an interview conducted via e-mail, Lucas said that he was
trying to help students avoid the ``frustrating'' experiences that
he had as a child growing up in Modesto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was often bored,'' he wrote. ``I often found myself
wondering, `Why can't school be more interesting?'''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lucas' foundation is providing schools with 30,000
copies of a documentary he produced. The film, ``Learn and Live,''
profiles five innovative school programs, including a fourth-grade
class at a California charter school that studies insect anatomy
with an electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, a senior partner in Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., an
investment firm, and the chairman of Gulfstream Aerospace, has said
he intends to use his program, which would transfer students to
private schools from public schools, as a wake-up call to force
public schools to improve.
</P>
<P>
   His initiative has been seen as an effort to establish a
political foothold for the school-voucher movement, which would use
taxpayer money for private-school tuition, a proposition that has
pleased parents whose students are languishing in inner-city
schools but has angered teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has not escaped criticism either. Though praised by the
president of the United Negro College Fund for raising the prospect
of minting hundreds of minority Ph.D.'s, Gates has been criticized
for excluding white students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give money to the public schools, you're going to make
the private schools unhappy,'' said Peter Dobkin Hall, a senior
research scholar at the Yale Divinity School who studies the
history of philanthropy. ``If you give money to particular groups
within the public schools, other groups will feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philanthropy is, intrinsically, not even-handed,'' Hall said.

FANS IGNORE WEATHER FOR A VIEW OF THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Weather permitting or not, fans follow Tiger
Woods, Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia, and the rest of the Ryder Cup
competitors in hearty numbers. Intermittent rain may have
inconvenienced some spectators Wednesday, but it did not keep them
from finding their favorite players, especially Woods. The most
popular player on the US team again drew a large gallery. Lots of
large golf umbrellas simply added to the challenge of getting a
good view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been bothered so far, but I wouldn't want to be
behind us,'' said John Gunderson of Weston, who huddled under an
umbrella with his wife Susan. ``It would be helpful to know the
course, to know the best spots to go from one Tiger watching spot
to the next. It's impressive, having not been to an event like this
before, how the crowd seems to move with their favorite players.''
</P>
<P>
   The only concession made to the rain was the pace at which
Woods's gallery moved. In order to get an unobstructed view, some
spectators skipped every other hole. For many, the conditions
required better preparation. The Gundersons brought rain suits, two

   Around 2 p.m., police and fire officials feared a blue backpack
might contain a bomb. The worrisome piece of luggage was left under
a tree between the 16th tee and a broadcast booth. After a dog was
brought in to sniff the backpack, police determined it did not
contain dangerous materials. Within 20 minutes the bag was returned
to its owner. ``Obviously, we have a plan for everything,'' said
Brookline police chief Daniel O'Leary. ``The Marshall made the call
and everybody responded. This is a major event. We have lots of
contigency plans. We're looking for a very happy and safe event.''
A group of Brookline firemen and policemen, including
representatives from the bomb squad, blocked off the area for 15
minutes. Spectators were then allowed to pass through the area
again, unaware of the incident . . . Despite the rain, celebrities
still found their way to The Country Club. Former Boston University
hockey player Travis Roy, who was paralyzed in his first collegiate
game, was spotted on the 16th hole. And LPGA Hall of Famer Pat
Bradley of Westford took in the practice round.

NEWS ANALYSIS: DOES DEAL WITH AUTOWORKERS HAVE SOMETHING FOR ALMOST
EVERYONE?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, the tentative agreement that the autoworkers'
union reached with DaimlerChrysler last week was just the type of
extravagant contract that President John F. Kennedy had once warned
the United Auto Workers against.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1962 speech to a UAW convention, Kennedy called for
``responsible unionism'' and cautioned the union that it could set
off an inflationary spiral if it used its bargaining muscle to
extract wage increases that far outpaced inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year agreement reached last week seems to do just that,
awarding some of the best raises obtained in a union contract in
years: annual wage increases of 3 percent on top of cost-of-living
adjustments that nearly match inflation. Those impressive raises,
union officials say, are likely to ensure ratification when
DaimlerChrysler workers vote on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The contract is expected to serve as a model for the union's
ongoing negotiations with General Motors and Ford Motor, meaning a
total of 400,000 autoworkers are likely to receive such inviting
raises. So are thousands of additional Canadian autoworkers, whose
union used the DaimlerChrysler agreement as the basis for an accord
with Ford on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unusual generosity of the DaimlerChrysler pact,
however, hardly any economists, auto executives or industry experts
are warning of disaster on the inflation front or to the industry's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The DaimlerChrysler agreement has not set off inflation alarm
bells the way it might have in the Kennedy era partly because a
contract reached with a Big Three automaker _ or with one of the
big steelmakers that Kennedy used to jawbone _ no longer sets a
lockstep nationwide pattern. In the past, coal, chemicals, rubber
and other industries would play follow the leader and often award
the same percentage raises the Big Three granted.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, unions in most industries are far weaker than
in the 1960s _ they represent 13.9 percent of the work force, down
from more than 30 percent in the 1960s. This makes it harder for
unions with upcoming negotiations, like Lockheed's machinists or
Southwest Airlines' ramp operators, to match the gains made by the
UAW, which still maintains a vise-like grip on the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the autoworkers negotiate a major agreement, it doesn't
carry over like in the '50s and '60s because other unions are
getting creamed by membership losses, growth in the nonunion sector
and the fear they'll lose their jobs to permanent replacement
workers if they strike,'' said Harry Katz, a Cornell University
professor of industrial relations.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor allaying fears of an inflationary spiral is that
corporations, facing intense competitive pressures from
globalization, have gotten far tougher about agreeing to wage
increases pushed by unions. Corporate America has changed its ways
since the 1950s and 1960s, when many companies rolled over in the
face of union wage demands, knowing they could always pass on added
costs to the consumer. Back then, companies hardly had to worry
about competition from imports, and most Americans had not yet
heard of Hondas or Toyotas.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be difficult for other unions to match the UAW's
percentage wage increases, labor leaders are sure to point to the
autoworkers' impressive gains to pressure employers to be more
generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good agreement,'' said Harley S. Shaiken, a
professor of industrial relations at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``It will become a benchmark for other contracts, but
that doesn't mean it will be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old contract, autoworkers typically earned between
$50,000 and $80,000 each year, depending on how much overtime they
worked.
</P>
<P>
   In labor circles, the agreement not only will become a powerful
symbol of a union delivering for its members, but also could boost
union members' morale and serve as a beacon that union organizers
point to during unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions were largely written off after their debacles of the
1980s, but this contract shows that unions can still have real
clout,'' Shaiken said. ``This shows that in its core industry, the
U.A.W. still packs a wallop.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The union has not secured such annual across-the-board increases
from the Big Three in two decades. Indeed, in obtaining ``inflation
plus 3 percent,'' the union obtained a formula common in the '50s
and '60s and first negotiated in 1948 by Walter Reuther, the
legendary autoworkers' leader, when the union's power was at its
pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, during Detroit's depressed 1980s, the union often
accepted pay freezes, and earlier this decade, the pattern in the
UAW's three-year contracts was a lump-sum payment but no raise in
the first year, and an annual increase in the second and third
years.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be surprising that last week's agreement is the
UAW's best in years because the Big Three's sales and profits are
booming and because Detroit, with its high-flying sport utility
vehicles, has Japan's automakers on the defensive. What is more,
the UAW's hand was strengthened, knowing the last thing Detroit
wanted was a strike when so many auto plants were unable to keep up
with demand.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a sharp contrast to the 1980s when the union's
bargaining clout was weakened by high unemployment and anemic
industry profits. It was a time when Japan's automakers acted like
Pac-Man characters, devouring the Big Three's market share. In
addition, UAW negotiators could not be deaf to all the experts who
declared that Detroit's labor costs and productivity levels were
out of line with Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   Although it could be short-lived, one factor that may help the
Big Three absorb the wage increases is the recent surge in the
Japanese yen, which makes Japanese goods more expensive. In
addition, Japanese auto assembly plants in the United States are
expected to match the DaimlerChrysler wage provisions as part of
their strategy to keep the UAW out, although their benefits remain
inferior to the UAW's.
</P>
<P>
   All this said, there is another reason that last week's
agreement has not caused Detroit to panic about soaring costs or
plummeting competitiveness: the accord gives DaimlerChrysler
considerable leeway to increase its productivity by reducing its
work force through attrition. The UAW's 1996 contracts placed harsh
restrictions on the Big Three's ability to cut employment at many
factories by more than 5 percent, except in the case of recession.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, the new agreement gives DaimlerChrysler more
latitude to trim its work force through attrition, although many
details have not yet been fully explained by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The pact also sweetens pensions to such a degree that it will
inevitably encourage many retirements. To allay the union's fears
about employment falling too steeply, the contract does require the
company to hire new workers _ sometimes one for every three
retirees, sometimes one for every two, sometimes one for one _
depending on how much employment falls at certain plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the opportunities this agreement creates for
DaimlerChrysler to get leaner, the corporation will not only be
able to absorb the cost of these wage increases, but will be able
to increase productivity and profitability,'' said Daniel Hoffman,
a former autoworker who is a professor of labor relations at
Michigan State University. ``The consumer shouldn't see any type of
price increase because this contract allows the corporation to save
so much money by allowing it to reduce its work force by
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts hail the contract as a win-win agreement
that other industries might seek to emulate. The reason: it allows
the autoworkers to share the fruits of productivity (in the form of
hefty wage increases) while letting automakers slim down further to
increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an agreement that will make the companies
more, not less, competitive,'' Shaiken said.

XEROX TO BUY TEKTRONIX INC.'S COLOR PRINTING BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.Y.)  (md) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp &UR; . &LR;  said Wednesday that it would buy Tektronix Inc.'s
color printing business for $950 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the combined business will have about $6 billion in
sales. They expect it to have about a 30 percent share of the
fast-growing networked color printer market, well below the 70
percent that Hewlett-Packard Co &UR; . &LR;  claims as its share, but a big
step up from Xerox's 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition doubles Xerox's distribution network, to 16,000
dealers across the globe. It lets Xerox capitalize on Tektronix's
solid-ink technology, a low-cost printing method that melts
crayon-consistency ink into droplets that resolidify on paper. And,
perhaps most important, it gives Xerox, which has a strong presence
in the low and high end of the color printer market, its first
major midprice products, which sell for $4,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a blockbuster, but it's a good deal in terms of
product, technology and marketing fit,'' said Peter J. Enderlin,
who follows Xerox for First Albany Corp &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tektronix, which is best known for testing and measurement
devices, lacks brand recognition outside of engineering circles.
Xerox and Tektronix had been discussing a deal that would let Xerox
sell Tektronix printers under the Xerox brand name. The idea for
the acquisition was born in June, when Tektronix disclosed plans to
spin off its $750 million printing business to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking to invest half a billion to develop this
market anyway, so when the opportunity to buy Tektronix came up, we
jumped all over it,'' G. Richard Thoman, Xerox's chief executive,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tektronix printer business, which is in Wilsonville, Ore.,
will become the headquarters of Xerox's office printing business,
and will be run by Gerald K. Perkel, a Tektronix executive. ``We
can now deploy the money we were spending to build a brand name
into developing products that offer customers more alternatives to
H. P.,'' Perkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thoman told analysts that the combination would yield
$40 million in unspecified saving, he said in an interview that it
would not result in significant job losses at Xerox's current color
printer headquarters in Webster, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is about growth, not consolidation,'' Thoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman said the deal would not dilute earnings and would add to
them in 2001. He chose the all-cash route, he said, because he
thought Xerox's stock, which had sunk well below the 52-week high
of nearly $64 that it hit in May, was undervalued, and because tax
benefits of stock deals are not applicable unless an entire company
is acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry J. Meyer, the Tektronix chairman, said he would distribute
the proceeds of the sale _ probably around $600 million after
taxes, closing costs and debt payments _ to Tektronix shareholders,
either through dividends or a share buyback.
</P>
<P>
   Tektronix shareholders seemed more enthusiastic than Xerox's.
Xerox's shares closed at $42.5625, up 56.25 cents. Tektronix shares
closed at $36.1875, up $1.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Other printer companies do not seem particularly worried. ``This
is just a consolidation of competitors that we've fared well
against in the past, and what Xerox has really bought is just a new
channel of distribution,'' Nolan M. Sundrud, a Hewlett-Packard
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Lexmark International Inc., a smaller but
fast-growing printer maker, seemed similarly unfazed. ``This deal
won't have any impact on our strategic direction, particularly
since Hewlett-Packard is still our biggest competitor,'' Roger
Rydell, a Lexmark spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, printer industry experts expect the deal to be beneficial
to customers. ``Coupling Tektronix's color savvy with Xerox's name
and marketing programs will yield increased competition that will
drive everyone's product quality up and prices down,'' said Jay
Ingalls, a research director at Gartner Group.

 &HT;    6 Chinese nationals indicted in Georgia smuggling scheme
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A grand jury indicted six Chinese nationals Wednesday
in the most elaborate human smuggling operation uncovered in recent
Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities, meanwhile, said they are investigating the
possibility that a foreign government played a role in the
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more involvement than what there appeared to be.
We're looking into other entities _ private and public,'' said
Thomas Fischer, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Atlanta. ``I'm quite optimistic that we
are going to unravel a very unusual, bizarre, sophisticated
smuggling operation.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say which governments his agency is
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents in Savannah found 132 Chinese men and boys on
Aug. 12 in a secret compartment of the Prince Nicolas, a 42,000-ton
freighter. On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted three crew members
and three ``stowaways.'' Each is charged with conspiracy to smuggle
and conceal aliens, unlawfully bringing aliens to the United States
for commercial advantage and concealing and harboring illegal
aliens, said Dan Drake, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office
in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the trade in smuggling people from China has
exploded into a multibillion-dollar business this decade. They say
organized crime groups control much of the trade. Once in the
United States or other countries, many immigrants work for years in
poor conditions to repay their debt to smugglers known as
``snakeheads.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS agent testified Sept. 1 that the immigrants on the Prince
Nicolas each paid $40,000 to $49,000 for a trip to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most smuggled Chinese go to New York City, but saturation of the
labor market there has sent some to Atlanta and other places.
Authorities have uncovered smuggling operations recently in
California, Canada, Georgia, Guam, Japan, the Northern Mariana
Islands, Midway Islands, New Jersey, New York and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Drake identified the indicted crew members as Zhang Zhi Zhong,
31, the captain; Shi Ya Dong, 58, the chief engineer; and Sun
Cheng, 36, a ``cabin boy.'' Drake said the ``stowaways'' indicted
are Zheng Huan Jian, 25; Zheng Xiao, 34; and Li Guo Guan, whose age
was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the ``stowaways'' facing charges conspired with
the crew to take the immigrants to the United States.

INTERNATIONAL COCAINE RING HAS BEEN CRACKED, FEDS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Ga., Calif., N.Y., Mexico)  (md) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal law-enforcement officials said Wednesday
that they had completed a two-year international investigation that
led to the arrest of more than 90 drug traffickers and the seizure
of 13 tons of cocaine, 2 and-a-half tons of marijuana and more than
$19 million.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation was centered in Mexico and funneled
Colombian cocaine across the Rio Grande to McAllen, Texas, where it
was stored in warehouses before being trucked beneath loads of
fruits and vegetables to New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San
Diego. Then it was shipped to distributors in other major cities
for street sales, the officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The same truck drivers who transported the cocaine north from
McAllen brought hundreds of millions in cash south for payment to
Mexican drug lords, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By targeting the cartel's importation, transportation and
distribution network, we have substantially hindered their ability
to move cocaine and other drugs into, and around, this country,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was not accompanied by claims that the
investigation broke any records for the amounts of drugs and cash
confiscated. But the officials were clearly elated at the level of
cooperation among law-enforcement agencies across the United States
and in other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the director of the FBI, called the operation
``an example of what can be achieved through cooperative efforts of
all law-enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service also
took part in the operation. Donnie Marshall, acting administrator
of the drug agency, and Raymond Kelly, the customs commissioner,
said the investigation was the kind needed to thwart sophisticated
international traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   One target of the operation, Jaime Aguilar Gastelum of Mexico,
was arrested Wednesday afternoon by Mexican police in Reynosa, not
far across the Rio Grande from McAllen. He was taken to Mexico City
pending extradition to the United States to face felony
drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   Three other drug tycoons were seized earlier, federal officials
said. They were identified as Arturo Arredondo, who oversaw the
loading of trucks; Jesse Quintanilla, in charge of Chicago
distribution, and Jorge Ontiveros-Rodriguez, responsible for wide
distribution from San Diego. Arredondo and Quintanilla hold joint
U.S. and Mexican citizenship, while Ontiveros-Rodriguez holds U.S.
and Cuban citizenship, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Other suspects were identified as citizens of the United States,
the Dominican Republic and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said police agencies from a dozen states,
Mexico and the Dominican Republic participated in the investigation
and arrests.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HITS TOBACCO INDUSTRY WITH LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department filed a multibillion-dollar
lawsuit against the tobacco industry Wednesday, claiming that
cigarette makers have waged a 46-year ``public campaign of deceit''
to hide the lethal hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who called a news conference to
announce the lawsuit, said the federal government spends $20
billion annually on smoking-related diseases that could have been
avoided if industry leaders had been honest about what they knew
about their product's dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have conducted themselves without regard to the truth,
without regard to the law,'' Reno said. ``They placed profits above
the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Little, a lawyer for tobacco giant Philip Morris Inc.,
assailed the lawsuit as ``baseless.'' He vowed his company will not
settle the case but instead will go to trial and rebuff the
government's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Little also accused President Clinton of being more interested
in winning political points than with upholding the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blatantly political lawsuit ... is nothing more than the
height of hypocrisy,'' Little said. ``... In fact, the government
has profited from the sale of cigarettes for decades through
collection of excise (sales) taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said in January that the government would sue the
industry by the end of the year, hailed the department's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is taking the right course of action,''
Clinton said. ``It is time for America's taxpayers to have their
day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, the
Justice Department seeks to recover more than $100 billion in
health-care compensation from the tobacco industry and for what the
government calls the industry's ill-gotten gains from lying about
smoking's dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers claim the industry's deceit began Dec. 15,
1953, when the heads of the major tobacco companies met in New York
City and agreed to mount a long-term public-relations campaign to
discount emerging studies linking cigarettes to lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   That ``intentional, coordinated campaign of fraud and deceit''
continues today, Reno said. ``The truth poses a mortal threat to
their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said, without further explanation, that
it has no pending criminal investigations of the tobacco industry.
The agency also said the litigation is not intended to drive the
industry or any of its members into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring the Justice Department's filing of the lawsuit was the
success Texas and other states have recently had in securing
out-of-court settlements totaling $246 billion with the tobacco
industry. But the federal government's litigation also follows a
string of defeats for the Clinton administration in its effort to
recover compensation for smoking related health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the states that have settled with the industry have
rejected Clinton's request that they pay 25 percent of the
recovered money to the federal government. Texas Republican Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison and state Attorney General John Cornyn have
told Clinton that the federal government is entitled to none of the
$17.6 billion the state recovered from tobacco companies after
lengthy and expensive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tobacco-industry leaders last year withdrew support
for a proposed $368.5 billion nationwide settlement of cigarette
litigation. The companies backed away after the Senate began
considering legislation that would cost the industry $516 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Little said his industry willingly entered into the settlements
with the states as part of a good-faith effort to resolve an honest
dispute between the states and the companies regarding health-care
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the federal government, unlike the states, has not
tried to broker an agreement with the industry. Instead, the
Clinton administration has chosen litigation that has ``no basis in
fact, no basis in law,'' Little added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad day for our Justice Department and a sad day for
our legal system,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   In its federal lawsuit, the Justice Department did not
specifically state how much money it hoped to recover from the
industry but said that it expects the figure to run into the
``billions of dollars.'' The court would have to calculate the
precise figure based on evidence presented at trial, said David
Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden also refuted Little's argument that the government
possessed adequate information about smoking's dangers, saying that
the industry had ``superior knowledge'' of the addictive quality
and harsh consequences of cigarettes. With ``deliberate
falsehoods,'' the industry encouraged people to keep smoking and
kept the full truth from the public, Ogden asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims in its lawsuit that tobacco-industry
leaders violated the major federal anti-racketeering law. They
conspired in a ``widespread scheme to frustrate public scrutiny by
making false and deceptive statements'' of what they knew to be the
dangers of cigarettes, the suit states.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also concealed documents and internal research
that showed smoking to be even more hazardous than the government
and consumers suspected, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recovering money, the Justice Department is
asking the federal court to order the industry to disclose all its
research on smoking's hazards and to fund advertising campaigns
aimed at discouraging people, particularly teenagers, from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The government says 3,000 teen-agers per day take up the habit
of smoking and that 1,000 of them will eventually suffer from a
smoking-related illness, such as lung cancer, emphysema, heart
attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Little, of Philip Morris, said the government has a strong
burden of proof to overcome in its lawsuit. Federal lawyers will
have to show that the tobacco industry misled the government about
the dangers of smoking or prove that individual cigarette consumers
were unaware of the hazards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little added it will be difficult for the government to argue it
was misled, in light of its massive advertising campaign during the
past 35 years to warn the public of the health risks of smoking.
Also, it would be a logistical and expensive burden for the
government to have the cigarette consumers come to court and
testify that they were deceived by the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will attack the legal sufficiency of the complaint
immediately and we believe it should be dismissed immediately,''
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. issued a statement that echoed
Little's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the federal government has any basis for
filing a lawsuit against the tobacco industry,'' the company said.
``We will vigorously defend against this suit in court; we are not
going to settle it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, the Justice
Department is suing Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard
Tobacco Co., The Liggett Group Inc., American Tobacco Co. and
British American Tobacco P.L.C.

CHINESE RESTATE GOALS TO REORGANIZE STATE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A four-day meeting of the Communist Party's top
leaders ended Wednesday with a reaffirmation of China's commitment
to reorganizing state-owned enterprises and making them competitive
in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The plenary meeting of the party's 189-member Central Committee
also gave Vice President Hu Jintao a symbolically important new
position as a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.
That adds to the evidence that Hu, at 56 the youngest senior
leader, is President Jiang Zemin's choice as a successor in several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday evening, the Central Committee called
the overhaul of state enterprises ``an important and urgent task.''
But it mainly restated problems and goals set out repeatedly in the
last two years and said that reforms had ``reached a crucial stage,
and some deeply rooted problems need to be dealt with'' _
suggesting that progress has been ragged.
</P>
<P>
   In sometimes vague and contradictory language, the statement
called for modern management of state enterprises and, in a break
with tradition, to offer direct performance-related financial
incentives to top managers of larger state companies. But it also
called for improved ``ideological and political work'' in such
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with much language about markets and preparing
industries to meet ``fierce global competition,'' the statement at
several points stressed the need for government to retain control
over pivotal industries, including emerging high-technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   China is struggling with a huge number of money-losing,
inefficient and redundant state enterprises, some dating from the
Mao Zedong era and others built up even as the country started
introducing market forces in the 1980s and early '90s. By wide
agreement, they are a serious drain on the economy, and their huge
debts imperil the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Jiang Zemin, also the Communist Party chief, called for
a major reorganization of larger industries, including
bankruptcies, mergers and new stockholding schemes. Smaller
companies were to be left to sink or swim. Last year, Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji vowed to turn around the sinking state sector
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up of coddled state enterprises is closely linked to
China's drive to join the World Trade Organization, because
membership would require reduced tariffs on imports and additional
opportunities for foreign businesses to compete in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the ailing state-run companies also provide jobs and welfare
to millions of people and power to industrial ministries and local
politicians. The backlash of threatened interests, corruption in
the dismantling of companies and Chinese leaders' concerns about
the political and social effects of layoffs have all hampered
change.
</P>
<P>
   From the statement Wednesday, it was unclear whether
conservative forces had blunted a drive for more sweeping and rapid
change or triumphant reformers had assuaged the opposition with
bromides about preserving state control.
</P>
<P>
   In a typically convoluted sentence, filled with the code phrases
suggesting opaque bureaucratic battles, the statement said: ``The
strategic adjustment of the layout of the state sector of the
economy needs to be combined with optimization of and improvements
in the industrial and ownership structure, sticking to advancement
in some areas and retrenchment in others and refraining from some
things in order to do others, so as to increase the ability of the
state sector to control the economy.''

EDUCATORS, BUSINESS DENOUNCE PLAN TO CUT RESEARCH FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing a loss of federal research funding that they say would
jeopardize 180,000 jobs in Massachusetts alone, universities joined
business and science groups Wednesday in a flurry of lobbying
efforts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The universities say that with Congress under pressure to stay
within spending caps approved in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
New England stands to lose $1.5 billion in research and design
money, about a third of the money university research here now
receives.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts would be especially hard hit, the American
Association for the Advancement of Science says that nationwide,
universities and companies that work with them will be socked with
a 12.5 percent cut in non-defense research and development
spending. University-run research across the country gets about $75
billion now. Massachusetts, which gets the lion's share of New
England funding, receives $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   About 285 companies or research centers in Massachusetts work
with universities in federally funded projects, according to the
Boston Chamber of Commerce, receiving about 72 percent of their
money from the federal government. In total, 180,000 Massachusetts
residents hold research jobs, the chamber says.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Harvard University president Neil Rudenstine and Tufts
University president John DiBiaggio, representatives of 40
universities joined the Boston Chamber and several science
organizations in trying to convince members of Congress and White
House staff that the effect on the New England economy would be
``dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal research money works harder than any other dollar,''
said Kevin Casey, senior director for state and federal relations
for Harvard, which receives about $270 million a year in federal
research funding. ``It works toward solving the problem you've
asked it to, it trains the young people working at the universities
to be the next generation of innovators, and, down the road, many
times it results in a commercial application that reverberates in
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Congress, the options are to override the caps, or to spend
the surplus to fund research. But some lawmakers have argued that
the surplus is better spent on tax cuts or Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is, that's short-sighted,'' Casey said.
``Because the only way we'll realize those surpluses is if the
research continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has spent more than the caps in the last two years,
leaving it even farther behind in trying to meet the balanced
budget targets this year, and increasing the pressure to stay
within the caps.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to keep up funding is pitting various federally
funded research agencies against one another. The Senate recently
restored cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation in its
version of an appropriation bill, but in doing so it took $20
million from the budget of the National Institutes for Health.
</P>
<P>
   University presidents, as well as some undergraduates and
graduate students involved in research, met Wednesday with White
House Chief of Staff John Podesta, as well as with members of the
Massachusetts congressional delegation and the Senate leadership,
arguing for an increase of at least the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The universities and related businesses say the cuts, if
approved in final appropriations bills, would not mean immediate
layoffs, but they would have a long-term effect on the economy.
University-based research, they argue, is at the heart of the boom
in biotechnology and telecommunications, responsible for
developments ranging from cellular telephones to laser eye surgery.
About 50 percent of the growth in the economy comes from
technology, much of it spinoffs of university research, said Ed
Pignone, chief of staff for the Boston Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is this a university issue, but it's an
economic-growth issue,'' said Paul Guzzi, president of the chamber.
``Research happens in the labs, it's then used to create companies.
These jobs wouldn't be eliminated immediately, but clearly in terms
of reductions those jobs which are very directly dependent on
funding would be at risk, at universities, in the defense industry,
in the private sector, at the vendors for those institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The universities say they may be the victim of their own
success. Last year was a boom year in federal spending for
university-based research. Agencies that control federal grants all
received increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel they gave us a good influx of money, so they
can take a year off and fund other priorities,'' Casey said. ``But
consistency is the most important thing. The worst thing for
research is to have big peaks and valleys in funding. You build
programs, and if the money dries up, you're left out there. What's
going on in discovery right now, it's happening faster. It's the
wrong time to reverse the trend.''

 &HT;    STARTUP TROUBLES FOR SENATE'S WACO PROBE
 &HT;    280&AMP;add.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigations into the 1993 Branch Davidian siege
at Waco, Texas, appeared Wednesday to be running into a traffic jam
at the starting line. Among the signs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Special counsel John Danforth has complained in a bluntly
worded letter that Senate investigators traveled to Waco last week
and interviewed witnesses ``without even troubling to give me a
call.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
is supposed to have jurisdiction over the Waco matter on his side
of Congress, said Wednesday that no one told him about the Senate
aides traveling to Texas either.
</P>
<P>
   _ In fact, the congressional investigators had been sent by Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has been angling to lead a special task
force to examine Waco. But Specter wants to expand the panel's
scope to include a slew of other controversies, including campaign
finance scandals and spying at the national weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   _ That plan is criticized by Democrats, who would prefer that
the Judiciary Committee conduct the probe.
</P>
<P>
   With these issues still unresolved Wednesday, an impatient
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told a gathering of
reporters that the decision about how to conduct the investigation
would be announced at 6 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to move on. I spend an inordinate amount of time on
it,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really got to go,'' he said after an aide put a note in
his hand advising him that a group from the Fruit of the Loom
apparel company was waiting in his conference room.
</P>
<P>
   However, 6 p.m. came and went with no announcement. The debate
over the scope and form of the Senate investigation continued
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   These are just some of the complications delaying a Senate
investigation of FBI actions during and after the April 19, 1993
attack on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco that left sect
leader David Koresh and 75 followers dead.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth has already sought delays of a civil lawsuit by
survivors and families of the tragedy against the federal
government so that his teams can interview witnesses first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that my investigation as Special Counsel is
best served if my staff can conduct interviews before witnesses are
interviewed by Congress or deposed in civil litigation,'' Danforth
wrote in his Sept. 17 letter to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, asked
``forbearance as I attempt to get on with the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassuring the senators that he had been moving
``expeditiously'' since he was named to his post on Sept. 9,
Danforth laid out his progress so far. He said he has chosen eight
staff members, found office space in St. Louis, and arranged with
the U.S. postal inspector's office to provide investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth took a trip to Waco himself last Monday to inspect the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his relations with yet another Waco investigation
appeared to be smoother. The House Government Reform Committee has
kept in contact with Danforth's office, said committee spokesman
Mark Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee has sent investigators to Austin to examine
evidence stored by the Texas Rangers, but the House has not tried
to question Waco witnesses, Carollo said. He said that the
committee was currently focusing on boxes of documents provided by
the Defense Department on its role in the Waco siege.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS WEIGH COSTLY FIGHTER'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Note to editors: this will sub if warranted)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret House-Senate conference that will decide
the fate of the Air Force's $70 billion F-22 fighter jet program
met late into the night Wednesday, with Republican leaders pushing
hard to save the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were leaning on one man: Rep. Jerry Lewis, a
California Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee's military spending panel, who led a successful fight in
the House to delete $1.8 billion in spending to buy the first six
of the warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate voted to spend the money and buy the planes, and
now a deal must be forged between the plane's supporters and
opponents. Republican senators, backed by senior House Republicans,
the Air Force, and the plane's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin
Corp., want all of the $1.8 billion restored now.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who argues that the F-22 is too expensive and too
untested to be built as planned, convinced the House this summer to
support a one-year pause in its production, so that the Air Force
and the Pentagon could reconsider plans to build three new fighter
jets in the coming decade, at a total cost of $350 billion, a sum
far greater than the annual Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force argues that a pause would kill the F-22 program.
It has already spent close to $25 billion developing the plane, but
has completed roughly five percent of the necessary flight tests.
Over the next decade, it plans to spend $40 billion or more
building 339 of the the aircraft. That puts the price tag of each
F-22 at close to $200 million, making it the costliest fighter jet
ever conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Aides privy to closed-door discussions preceding Wednesday's
House-Senate conference said a compromise over the F-22 could take
several forms. Some of the $1.8 billion could be restored, enough
to buy two or three planes, instead of six. All the money could be
restored, but a substantial portion would go for more research and
further tests of the aircraft, under a ``fly before you buy''
rationale.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise could also reduce the number of planes to be built
from 339 to roughly 250, reducing the overall cost of the program,
but increasing the cost per plane.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, said Wednesday night that he was
``ready to offer a new position'' on the F-22. ``We're trying to
work it out,'' he said, but added that Lewis was ``standing firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican who supported full
funding for the F-22, said that Stevens and Lewis were ``not very
close together. They're far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Some deal must be reached before the negotiators agree on a
Pentagon spending bill for the new fiscal year, which begins on
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to back Lewis' plan to spend the $1.8 billion on
other less expensive aircraft, and House Specker Dennis Hastert
supported that idea. But Air Force officials managed to change
Hastert's mind, and he ordered Lewis to find a way to restore some
of the money for the F-22, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 has also been strongly supported by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay. Both are
Texas Republicans; many billions for the F-22 program would be
spent at Lockheed Martin's plant in Fort Worth, Texas.

 &HT;    Gates in TV rights chase
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You think the feud between Ted Turner and Rupert
Murdoch is nasty? Wait until Microsoft co-founder and World's
Richest Man Bill Gates begins his assault on Murdoch's stranglehold
on live English Premier League television rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is assembling an American team of cable and broadcast
parties to challenge Murdoch, whose News Corp. subsidiary British
Sky Broadcasting is in the fourth year of a five-year, $1.2 billion
deal with the English Football Association.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Sunday Times of Singapore, an FA official said
the Gates group is planning to bid $1.62 billion next season. With
the big boys wanting in on the action, don't expect FIFA head Sepp
Blatter to be able to pull off his goal of reconciling the global
soccer calendar all that easily.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing appetite for televised soccer figures to make it
even more difficult for clubs to rest players from matches and
adjust to hectic travel. The European Champions League was expanded
this year to head off efforts by television moguls to start their
own super league. The 32 clubs will play in two different group
stages through March, while continuing a heavy slate of
domestic-league and cup action. The two teams in the May 24 finals
will have played 16 Champions League matches.
</P>
<P>
   Some notable clubs, especially defending European champion
Manchester United, already are taking a heavy toll. No fewer than
nine Red Devils are on the injured list, which grew Tuesday when
key midfielder Ryan Giggs went down for six weeks with a hamstring
tear. ``This spiral cannot go on forever,'' Blatter told the Swiss
newspaper Sonntags Zeitung over the weekend. ``There has to be one
time each year when there is no football. Only then can the desire
for the game be maintained in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions League Barcelona got two goals in three minutes from
Rivaldo to thrash Fiorentina 4-2 Wednesday to take the lead in
Group B. Although tied on points with Arsenal, a 3-1 winner over
AIK Stockholm, the Spanish champions are at the top by virtue of
five total goals. In London, Thierry Henry came on in the 68th
minute and scored the winner for Arsenal at the end of
regulation.... Injury-plagued captain Roy Keane returned to the
Manchester United lineup and scored early in the first half in a
3-0 Group D rout at Sturm Graz. ... Fredi Bobic had two goals in
Borussia Dortmund's 3-1 win over Boavista in Group C, while Marcelo
Salas got the winner for Lazio in the 72nd minute in a 2-1 Group A
decision over Dynamo Kyiv.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, midfielder Michael Tarnat was forced to finish out
Bayern Munich's 2-1 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the
nets because all three of the club's full-time goalkeepers were
injured. Stefan Wessels, called up from Bayern's amateur side,
stood in goal Tuesday as Tarnat got the equalizer off a deflection
with a minute remaining in a 1-1 draw in Group F with Rangers in
Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Chelsea lost 2-1 in Group H at Hertha Berlin,
with Ali Daei scoring in the third and 70th minutes. In the same
group, Leonardo and Andrii Shevchenko scored in the last two
minutes of the first half as AC Milan beat visiting Galatasaray
2-1.... In Group E, Savio had two goals as Real Madrid routed
Norwegian surprise Molde 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   England: Shearer takes five
</P>
<P>
   New manager Bobby Robson's home debut Sunday for Newcastle was a
badly needed boost of confidence for slumping England captain Alan
Shearer, who exploded for five goals as the Geordies routed
Sheffield Wednesday 8-0 for their first Premier League win of the
season. France: Les Bleus shakeup
</P>
<P>
   Upset over lackluster play in Euro 2000 qualifying, French coach
Roger Lemerre is serious about lineup changes for the Oct. 9 finale
vs. Iceland. The World Cup champions, in danger of missing next
year's finals, need a win plus a draw between the Ukraine and
Russia to advance. Lemerre is peeved at defender Frederic Dehu and
keeper Fabien Barthez, both sent off in last week's surprisingly
tough 3-2 win at Armenia. ``We left a bad image,'' Lemerre said.
``The respect due to the (World Cup) team has been tarnished.''

ROBIN WILLIAMS YEARNS TO BE A STAND-UP GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ ``I'm getting so excited, I'm going to use the
bathroom,'' says Robin Williams, leaping out of his chair in a
Toronto hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not talk of his new movie, ``Jakob the Liar,'' or
any Williams movie that has his juices flowing. His exuberance
springs from a dramatic career move he is about to make.
</P>
<P>
   After starring in huge box-office hits like ``Patch Adams'' and
``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and winning an Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting,''
Williams, 48, is about to give up acting for a while to return to
his first love: stand-up comedy. ``Sometime after the first of the
year, I'm going to just write and perform. I have to stay focused,
which means I can't be doing a movie (set ital)and(end ital)
stand-up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there haven't been any movie offers to turn down.
``Maybe because it's a dry period or maybe people are going,
`That's enough,''' he says with the carefree laugh of someone who
doesn't define himself by what Hollywood thinks of him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go back to comedy came from Williams' feeling
that he might be losing his edge. He has an ambitious agenda to
premiere his new routine at a club in San Francisco and then take
it on the road ``to see what flies in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing about comedy, Williams says, is that there is no
one but yourself to blame if it flops. ``You can't say, `Oh, the
script wasn't right' or `It's the director.' No, it's you. You get
a grace period of maybe five minutes of people going, `Yeah, I know
you. You're famous.' But then if you don't have the chops, it gets
really interesting and you start to sweat and you start finding
stuff that works. It's a process. I need to do that. I have to. I'm
getting the bug again in me.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the Toronto International Film Festival for the
premiere of ``Jakob the Liar'' last week, Williams seemed to be
trying out new material _ for example, a Viagra joke that, without
the cruder references, goes something like: ``It's amazing that
they've developed a pill to (increase your potency) but they don't
have one to increase your thought processes. A guy goes, `I'd
rather have a stiff (organ) than a big mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get near that time _ the end of the millennium _ there
is a lot to talk about, and you've got to find it,'' says Williams,
who will be the subject of a tribute October 14 at the Mill Valley
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As with every major decision, this career change was made after
long discussions with his wife, Marsha Garces Williams. ``Even
though Robin hasn't really been doing comedy in the last decade,
it's an important, rejuvenating part of him,'' she says, explaining
why she encouraged him even though his new gig will take him away
from their San Francisco home and two children, ages 10 and 7.
(Williams also has a teenage son from his first marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   Garces Williams, 43, is soft-spoken and almost somber. As she
archly points out, ``Anyone seems serious compared to Robin.'' She
and Williams met when his first wife hired her as their nanny. They
became reacquainted after his divorce and married 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Garces Williams struck gold the first time she produced one of
her husband's movies, ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' which grossed $219
million. Nobody is expecting that kind of bonanza for ``Jakob the
Liar,'' a tragicomedy about Polish Jews during the Nazi occupation,
which she also produced.
</P>
<P>
   After the film had been shot in Eastern Europe, they learned of
another tragicomedy about the Holocaust, Roberto Benigni's ``Life
Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds that after 55 years there is another movie
about that time to have elements of humor? What luck,'' Williams
says with a sigh. ``People have said to me, `Did your heart sink
when Roberto won the Academy Award?' I said no. It's an
extraordinary movie, an outrageous statement for Roberto as a
comedian. But our movie is more of a drama with moments of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Peter Kassovitz sent the ``Jakob the Liar'' script to
Williams, incorrectly assuming that he is Jewish. Garces Williams
read it and persuaded her husband to take on the role of an
out-of-work cafe owner in the Jewish ghetto who, to keep up his
friends' spirits, pretends to have a radio beaming good news from
the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marsha has great instincts about roles,'' says Williams,
recalling how she encouraged him to do ``Good Will Hunting'' when
he was wavering. ``She'll say to me, `This is different. I haven't
seen you do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   She watched the rushes every day on the set of ``Jakob'' and
told him when something worked and when it didn't. Williams says he
especially appreciates her honesty in a business where it is
sometimes hard to believe what people tell him. ``The difference is
Marsha loves me and they don't. They are not your friends. They are
looking at you from a distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces Williams calls it ``fortunate'' that they work well
together but doesn't think being his producer has strengthened
their marriage. ``Our marriage is strong because of love and
determination and respect and beautiful children and humor, because
if you can't laugh at yourself in a marriage, you are missing out
on a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In a life that can be ``so surreal because of the nature of
fame,'' Williams credits his wife with ``gently and sometimes not
so gently bringing me back to earth. I can go off and be wild and
to do these riffs that I do. Then she'll go, `Psst, it's time to
come back to the real world.'''

 &HT;    Anderson: `It stinks to sit there and watch'
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson, who
rushed for an NFC-best 1,846 yards in 1998, will miss the rest of
this season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his
right knee in Monday night's 24-7 loss at Dallas. Anderson, who
signed a five-year, $32-million contract in August, will undergo
surgery in about two weeks. Anderson faces six or seven months of
rehabilitation and should be ready for next year's training camp.
Anderson spoke Wednesday with NFL writer Mark Schlabach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your mindset now?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, it's upsetting, particularly with the way things
are going for us as a team. I felt like I needed to pick it up
myself, along with everybody around us, in light of what happened
to (quarterback Chris Chandler, who missed the Dallas game with a
strained right hamstring). It was terrible. I felt like I could pop
up and walk and run again, but the results proved differently. I'm
upset right now and frustrated a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about speculation that your two-week holdout from
training camp contributed to this injury?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've always had pride in myself for being a person of class
and certain stature. I just won't even address that. It was
disheartening to me and my family and the reaction _ positive or
negative _ is irrelevant. I never reported as light (236 pounds) as
I did. My hamstrings held up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you glad you signed a new contract before getting hurt?
</P>
<P>
   A: Given the season we had last year and running the ball 410
times, obviously you're putting yourself at great risk any time you
get on the field. But running that many times, it was a
consideration to make sure that my future was secure. We took all
those things into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you blame artificial turf for the injury?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a tough call. I don't really like playing on turf. I
love grass games. I consider myself a football purist and I believe
football should be played on grass. I just like the way I look
after playing on grass; I like being dirty after the game. But we
play in the Georgia Dome, so it's just something I had to deal
with. People said you look quicker on turf. I think (the injury
happened) from watching too many Barry Sanders highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will you be back?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I wanted to play, I could assure you that I could probably
play at the end of the season. It's one of those things, how much
you want to push yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will you cope with not playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: It stinks, man. It's no fun. This is football season, and it
stinks to sit there and watch. It was painful to watch them on
Monday night. I will suffer hopefully 18 weeks like that with the
playoffs and everything.

GOP UNDER PRESSURE AS PROJECTED SPENDING MAY EXCEED BUDGET CAPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid accusations within their own party that they
have used accounting ``gimmicks,'' Republican leaders are under
pressure to raise federal spending caps to meet Year 2000 budget
requests.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the projected
spending in next year's appropriations measures could drain at
least $16 billion from the Social Security Trust Fund, despite
Republican claims to the contrary, if anticipated surpluses fail to
materialize next year. The new fiscal year begins in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Larry Craig of Idaho and Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska have issued a similar warning, telling their colleagues
that techniques such as declaring emergency spending or
``borrowing'' from future budgets in order to get around the 1997
spending caps is, at the least, a disingenuous way to run the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel accused his colleagues of ``living a charade, which
demeans our country,'' and called on Republican leaders to
acknowledge that next year's budget will indeed break the caps
agreed to by Congress and President Clinton in 1997 _ a deal that
helped achieve a balanced budget last year for the first time in
nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., has done just that, telling reporters
that the caps have already been exceeded because ``we've had
emergencies we've had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP and Democratic critics say those emergencies, such as
declaring funding for the 2000 census and for some routine defense
programs to be emergency-related expenditures, are not really
emergencies at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have shown an inability to get the basic job
of Congress done, and that is writing and passing and getting
signed the spending bills in the budget. They can't make their
budget work or stand on its own without resorting to cheap budget
gimmicks,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the Republicans to realize that the budget
they're operating under is faulty and that they need to go back to
the drawing board,'' Gephardt said, calling on Republicans to admit
they've abandoned their promise to stay within the spending caps
and away from Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's admission underscored the problem Republicans are having
in keeping their promise not to break the budget limits set two
years ago and to protect Social Security. Pressures have been
building not only to maintain adequate funding for government next
year, but to come up with new spending for programs favored by
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders say they need $20 billion to $30 billion in
extra funding next year just to meet the demands for new spending
from their own colleagues. That money, some lawmakers say, will be
impossible to come up with even if next year's projected non-Social
Security surplus is enough to cover it, given that the 1997
spending limits mandated funding cuts of $37 billion this year for
non-Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to declaring some program funding as emergency
spending (which takes it off budget and means that it cannot be
counted against the 1997 spending caps), GOP leaders are trying
other ways to avoid the appearance of having busted the balanced
budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One effort is centered around taking money earmarked for the
Department of Housing and Human Services. That could lead to
further cuts in some education programs and a number of housing and
social service programs, such as day care. Some consideration also
has been given to delaying several billion in tax credit payments
to low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the use of the HHS money for other programs, such as
favored defense projects, GOP leaders in the House want to replace
it by using a forward-funding accounting technique that would
borrow $15 billion in fiscal year 2001 money for education and Head
Start programs.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear, however, whether Lott and Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, will go along. Both have
urged caution in the handling of HHS cuts, and it seems likely that
Senate Republicans will end up looking elsewhere for additional
funding. The question is, where will it come from?
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., urged
Republicans Wednesday to reconsider their opposition to President
Clinton's proposed increase in the tobacco tax, which they insisted
would help meet additional spending priorities without having to
draw on Social Security receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we use Social Security funding or the tobacco tax. I'll
settle for the tobacco tax any day,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, last week
acknowledged the difficulty of finding new funding sources, telling
reporters that lawmakers have ``bumped into a wall'' in terms of
figuring out how to stay within the budget limits without giving in
to temptations to declare more emergencies and spend more of the
projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   With fiscal year 2000 beginning on Oct. 1, Congress has so far
approved and Clinton has signed into law only two of the 13 major
appropriations bills. Ten remain either tied up in conference
committees between the House and Senate or under consideration by
one chamber or the other. The largest bill, which covers
appropriations for HHS, has yet to be reported out of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Given the differences between the administration and Republicans
on spending priorities, it now seems increasingly likely that
Congress will pass a series of stop gap spending bills, known as
continuing resolutions, to keep the government operating past Sept.
30 and, quite possibly, through next year if a compromise on
remaining 2000 budget matters cannot be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Republicans say they want is a repeat of the
1995-96 partial government shutdowns, and a continuing resolution
would at least allow affected departments to continue operating
through 2000 at this year's funding levels.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters
Wednesday that he sees little chance of another ``train wreck''
like the one that occurred four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been discussion of a CR to move forward, so I don't
think there's ... any danger ... that somehow the government will
shut down,'' Lockhart said. ``We don`t see any reason to head into
October 1st, you know, with anticipation of a train wreck.''

AID TO TIMOR DELAYED BY DANGERS IN ITS TERRIFIED STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Continuing concerns about security are
delaying the start of a huge aid program to help hundreds of
thousands of East Timorese refugees in urgent need of food, shelter
and medical care, several aid workers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of an international peacekeeping mission to
subdue the terror here and provide security for aid distribution,
military officials said East Timor remained tense and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult security situation,'' said Brig. Gen. Mark
Evans, commander of the Australian troops who are the bulk of the
international presence here. ``It's going to take a little time.
There are still some very dangerous people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jason Ross, another member of the peacekeeping force, said
secure areas had been prepared for refugees at the Roman Catholic
cathedral, the port and the stadium, but he said the military could
offer no food or water. ``It is still two or three more days before
the care agencies can come with supplies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the first 150 troops landed Wednesday in the eastern
city of Baucau, the first international deployment outside Dili. So
far, about 2,000 soldiers are working to secure the capital, the
general said. He said that even though his troops had met no open
resistance, the city Wednesday was noticeably more tense than in
the first two days of their deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Through a long and enervating afternoon, tough young men
wandered the streets, apparently both supporters and opponents of
independence for East Timor. There was an air of menace and
potential violence.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the international forces, Maj. Gen. Peter
Cosgrove, has said that his forces are not here to carry out an
aggressive campaign against the militias, and indeed a number of
his officers have noted that they are ``thin on the ground,'' with
a force that is expected to grow to no more than 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   On foot and in two vehicle convoys of armored personnel
carriers, the troops have been patrolling the capital, and stopping
and searching men they suspect to be carrying weapons. Any armed
men they find are handed over to the Indonesian police, who
themselves have been accused of cooperating with the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
military discovered a cache of 40 weapons Wednesday, bringing the
number of confiscated weapons to 600. He said caches of explosives,
mostly based on fertilizer or nitrate, had also been found.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the body of a Dutch reporter was discovered in
eastern Dili, a British reporter said that a bullet had been fired
at her in the well-patrolled center of the city. In both cases,
militias backed by the Indonesian military or elements of the
military itself were suspected.
</P>
<P>
   After the people here chose independence in a referendum on Aug.
30, the militias, who oppose independence, opened a campaign of
terror that has left the city terrified and in ruins. Now, with
foreign troops patrolling in armored personnel carriers, some
pro-independence fighters have come down from the hills to look
around.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports of atrocities by the militias began to
emerge Wednesday. Late Wednesday evening, two military officers
said a patrol would be sent in the morning to a house in the city
center to investigate a report that bodies had been found in a
well.
</P>
<P>
   One Indonesian reporter said the decapitated body of a woman had
been found in the well and that there were believed to be a number
of others. The reporter said instruments of torture had been found
on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   With parts of the burned-out shopping district still smoldering
Wednesday, hundreds of frightened refugees moved from place to
place, carrying their belongings on their heads, pulling them in
carts or trundling them along piled high on looted office chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes at night we are sleeping and the soldiers shoot into
the air,'' said Marco Artur Nevis de Sousa, 20, as he and his
family headed toward the city's small stadium with a load of
mattresses, cooking pots, rubber tires, a red furry Santa Claus, a
guitar, a stack of plastic chairs and a large framed painting of
the Last Supper.
</P>

   ``They get drunk and they shoot their guns and they make the
children afraid, the ladies afraid and they cry,'' he said. ``Now
the Australians say, `Come to the stadium and we will protect
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Maher, who represents the aid agency World Vision, said
the distribution of aid to more 30,000 desperate people camped in
the hills above Dili would not begin for several more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting at ground zero,'' he said. ``We have no
vehicles and no compound. We have food in warehouses in Jakarta.
People have the notion you can arrive and dump food off, but that
is very ineffectual. It only feeds the strong. We want to do this
properly; if you don't, you end up with mayhem.''

   Relief officials estimate that about 200,000 people have fled
their homes throughout this territory of 800,000 and that another
200,000 have fled or have been forcibly removed across the border
into West Timor. Many of these people, they said, are in urgent
need of food and other supplies. The refugees who are camped in the
hills above Dili say they are eating little more than cassava roots
and are sleeping on the ground and covering themselves with leaves
against the cold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these displaced people, many others who remain in
vandalized towns and villages around East Timor are also suffering,
aid officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parachute drops of relief aid have not proceeded in the numbers
that had been planned. In the village of Dare, six miles south of
Dili, an official with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
said a small amount of food aid had been delivered but was not
being distributed because so many people were in need that it was
impossible to apportion it fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Urs Boegli, a spokesman for the International Committee of the
Red Cross, said, ``I would not dare open a large distribution point
now because I am afraid people will come out of their relative
safety to get food. The rest of our problem is based on security.
The city is not a challenge. The challenge is beyond the city. You
can only venture there with a modicum of security.''
</P>
<P>
   A military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said,
``Humanitarian agencies are here, but their work is particularly
difficult. There is the question of where they are going to set up
their bases, where they are going to find resources such as
transportation, but particularly the question of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior military officer said, ``It'll take time. The
militias haven't faded away. This is a difficult country to cover,
and we have a limited number of men and you can't police every back
alley.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are more police in New York City than we have
soldiers here, and they still haven't managed to stop the
killings.''

`MINUS MAN' ADDS UP TO UNEXCEPTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Don't bring a dumb date'' is a cocky (not to mention
condescending) tag line for a movie, and ``The Minus Man'' doesn't
entirely live up to the boast. It's an intriguing enough study of
an ingratiating young man who happens to be a serial killer, but
your smart date is just as likely to find it dry and empty as to
find it perceptive and thought-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Hampton Fancher, who wrote the screenplays for
1982's ``Blade Runner'' and 1989's ``The Mighty Quinn,'' isn't
interested in exploitation _ or even chills (this is probably the
least violent serial-killer movie you'll ever see). He's primarily
interested in getting inside the head of Vann (Dallas' Owen
Wilson), a sweet, attractive, low-key guy who has a nasty habit of
poisoning people (even this is seen as part of Vann's ``niceness,''
because he picks the most humane way he can think of to dispatch
his victims).
</P>
<P>
   The movie sees things through Vann's eyes, and because even he
doesn't know why he indulges in his fatal hobby, it's up to us to
try to figure out his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Vann drifts into an oceanside town, where he boards with Jane
and Doug (Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox), a couple who are also more
troubled than they appear on the surface. Doug gets Vann a job at
the post office, where Vann attracts the attentions of a shy
co-worker (a more-vulnerable-than-usual Janeane Garofalo). And he
continues to practice his pastime, getting more bold and sloppy as
he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Another tag line for the movie is ``Conversation usually
follows,'' and that seems like a better boast, as the movie is
almost guaranteed to get you talking about what makes Vann and the
others tick (of course, the conversation might start with ``What
the $%&AMP;! was that all about?''). The movie's press notes
breathlessly brag about how it's a look behind the ``surface of
normality,'' as if that were an original concept. It wasn't even
original when Alfred Hitchcock, whom Fancher clearly admires,
addressed it decades ago in ``Suspicion'' and ``Shadow of a
Doubt.'' You can even catch variations on the theme in two other
movies this week, ``American Beauty'' and ``Mumford.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fancher does give ``The Minus Man'' a sustained moodiness,
marked by dark humor, and he gets good performances out of his
cast, especially Wilson and Cox. Singers Dwight Yoakam and Sheryl
Crow are impressive in a brief, booze-soaked prologue.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to be comfortable with a movie about a sympathetic
serial killer when real-life mass violence has recently hit so
close to home. Comfort isn't the point here, though; the point is
to get you talking. ``The Minus Man'' succeeds at that, but despite
the movie's pride in itself, it's unlikely that the conversation
will last the entire post-movie meal or long drive home.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department closed the book Wednesday on
its criminal investigation of the tobacco industry and instead
filed a far-reaching civil lawsuit that accuses the largest
cigarette companies of conspiring since the 1950s to defraud and
mislead the public about the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover billions of dollars the federal
government spent on smoking-related health care for elderly
Medicare patients, military veterans and federal employees,
expenses not covered by the $246 billion in settlements that the
industry reached last year with the states over smoking-related
Medicaid costs for the poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who first announced that the Justice
Department would pursue such a lawsuit in his State of the Union
Message last January, told reporters at the White House on
Wednesday that ``the tobacco companies should answer to the
taxpayers for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Relying heavily on documents unearthed in the state claims, the
lawsuit accuses the tobacco industry of promoting biased research,
wrongly asserting that nicotine was not addictive and falsely
denying that they were targeting their products to children.
</P>
<P>
   Along with monetary damages, which the suit says exceed $20
billion a year, the suit seeks to tap into what the suit calls the
tobacco industry's ``ill-gotten gains'' and force the industry to
finance education programs about the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 45 years, the companies that manufacture and sell
tobacco have waged an intentional, coordinated campaign of fraud
and deceit,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news
conference. ``As we allege in the complaint, it has been a campaign
designed to preserve their enormous profits whatever the cost in
human lives, human suffering and medical resources. The
consequences have been staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include Philip Morris Cos., The Liggett Group,
American Tobacco Co., British-American Tobacco PLC,
British-American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co.
Along with these companies, which sell more than 98 percent of the
cigarettes in the United States, the suit also names two industry
groups, the Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. and the Tobacco
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Condemning the suit as politically motivated, tobacco executives
vowed to seek its immediate dismissal. ``We will not succumb to
politically correct extortion,'' said Greg Little, associate
general counsel for Philip Morris. ``We will not settle this
lawsuit. We're right on the law. We're right on the facts. We will
prevail in this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism also came from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which
accused the Clinton administration of pursuing the lawsuit because
Congress last year failed to act on tobacco legislation that would
have tightened the regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business can feel secure in the United States when the
enormous power of the Justice Department can be unleashed against
them for the purpose of raising revenue and scoring political
points,'' Bruce Josten, the chamber's executive vice president,
said in a statement. ``This is nothing more than taxation through
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry foes praised the Justice Department for keeping the
makers and marketers of cigarettes on their heels. ``When the
Justice Department wins, it will be a great victory by the American
taxpayers,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who has fought for
tighter regulation of the tobacco industry. ``The tobacco companies
have perpetrated a fraud on the American people for decades. When
it comes to a matter of law, all their campaign contributions won't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit heats up an issue that was already bubbling on the
campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans, who
receive the bulk of the industry's political donations, have
accused the White House of going too far to regulate what is a
legal product. The House and Senate have resisted an administration
effort to add $20 million to the appropriations bill that funds the
Justice Department to pay for the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is generally
considered the leading Republican presidential contender, said that
Bush ``hoped the era of big government will not be replaced by the
era of big lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government case is built upon much of the same
evidence as the state cases, the Justice Department is relying on
different statutes _ the Medical Care Recovery Act and the Medicare
Secondary Payer Act, both of which the government typically uses to
recover medical costs in individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   By amassing the cases of tens of thousands of smokers into one
suit, the government is seeking to sidestep the industry's
preference for trying smoking cases smoker by smoker. The industry
argues that smokers have long been warned of the health effects of
smoking, but the government's lawsuit says the industry engaged in
a vigorous campaign to create doubt among smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials refused to elaborate on the end of
the criminal investigation, which began about five years ago and
looked into whether tobacco executives lied to Congress and
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The civil case cannot use evidence obtained during the Justice
Department's criminal investigation without a court order. But the
civil case can rely on documents that came to light during the
state suits and other suits filed by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, the suit cites a 1998 press release issued by a
trade group, the Tobacco Institute, saying claims that cigarette
smoking is addictive ``defy common sense and contradict the fact
that people quit smoking every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit is the first the government has filed
against an entire industry using the RICO statute. The law was
drafted in the late 1960s to fight organized crime but has been
broadly applied by federal prosecutors against businesses and
others engaged in a pattern of illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   A few states, including Florida and Texas, have used RICO counts
in their lawsuits against the cigarette makers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I can't remember an entire industry that was targeted as if it
was a racketeering enterprise'' by the federal government, said
Joseph DiGenova, a former federal prosecutor in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Justice Department's decision to formally end its
long-running criminal investigation, DiGenova said that he believed
the decision was practical and well founded. While the burden of
proof in a criminal case is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the
burden in the type of civil action filed on Wednesday is only a
preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose the easier route for them and very wisely because
criminal cases, by their very nature, are iffy,'' said DiGenova.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As an entertainment possibility, ``Double
Jeopardy'' is a pretty risky bet.
</P>
<P>
   Going for it is a no-nonsense lead performance by Ashley Judd, a
solid but seen-that second lead from Tommy Lee Jones, unfussy and
deft direction from ``Driving Miss Daisy's'' Bruce Beresford and a
kicky central concept, which can basically be described as the
Countess of Monte Cristo, with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But stacked up against the film is a pile of implausibilities
that it simply doesn't possess the thrills or momentum to distract
a viewer from. The script, by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook
(``The Rock''), is neither clever enough to sustain intrigue nor
psychologically astute enough to make much of this rare screen
opportunity to examine a woman bent on violent, self-righteous
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem from a faulty basic premise. We're told that
someone falsely convicted of murder can get away with actually
killing the same person, since the constitutional protection
against double jeopardy prohibits being tried twice for the same
crime. Of course, the real murder in this particular scenario would
be a wholly separate felony, committed at a different time and
place, same victim or not.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell Hollywood that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the assumption that she can really blast it to her
deceitful rat of a husband is all that gets Judd's Libby Parsons
through her stint in a Washington state prison. Well, that and the
fact that she's otherwise probably the most rational person who's
ever been framed.
</P>
<P>
   Seems her rich hubby Nick (Bruce Greenwood in a nicely slippery
turn) had been doing some bad things at the bank. When he
disappeared off a romantic sailboat overnighter, leaving blood
smears and a big knife for Libby to pick up just as the Coast Guard
arrived, she was the only plausible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that a body was never found; Libby got convicted in no
time flat, although she was able to turn over guardianship of her
little boy, Matty, to best friend Angie (Annabeth Gish).
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Angie soon disappears. And when Libby finally
tracks her down through the limited-access prison phone, guess
whose voice is on the other end of the line?
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Nick's alive and in possession of their son, Libby hits
the workout yard. By the time she's paroled, she's a lean, mean,
vengeance machine. But there's this problem: She's supposed to stay
in a halfway house run by strict, trouble-pasted Travis Lehman
(Jones), not a good situation for someone who needs to track her
identity-switching ex across two-thirds of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Libby soon steals Travis' gun, and with him in hot pursuit
heads down to New Orleans, where Nick has apparently reconstituted
himself so Beresford can shoot lots of French Quarter color and
stage a suspenseful encounter in one of those above-ground
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Judd strikes a refreshingly consistent, implacable attitude
early on in these proceedings; even when Libby gets sentimental,
there's a canny, believable practicality behind it. Jones does a
low-rent rendition of ``The Fugitive's'' Marshal Gerard; Travis has
a drinking problem, one already wrecked career behind him and his
own child custody problems, which of course makes him receptive to
the possibility that Libby's loony story just might be true.
Otherwise, Jones may as well be searching for a one-armed man.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his time might have been better spent figuring out how
Libby got onto a commercial airliner carrying his gun in her
backpack. Or what kind of insurance company pays death benefits to
a murdering spouse. Or how a wealthy stranger could become a
big-city socialite without anyone looking into his background.
</P>
<P>
   Or, most puzzlingly, how scripts with as many holes in them as
``Double Jeopardy'' get made into straight-faced movies. &QL;

 &HT;    Floyd proves costly for East Carolina
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flooding from Hurricane Floyd that is ravaging
eastern North Carolina has stranded the East Carolina team in
Columbia, S.C., this week _ the week of its big game against No. 9
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The school is in Greenville, N.C., about 75 miles east of
Raleigh. Because of damage from Floyd, the players and coaches
couldn't go home after winning at South Carolina on Saturday to go
3-0. The campus remains unfit for students, and an apartment
complex where two dozen players live has been condemned.
</P>
<P>
   So the team has stayed in Columbia and used South Carolina's
practice facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding even forced relocation of Saturday's game from
Greenville to Raleigh and N.C. State's Carter-Finley Stadium. The
game had been touted as one of East Carolina's biggest at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to lose a good recruiting weekend,'' coach Steve
Logan said. ``There's a lot of stuff involved. But I'm still glad
we're playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's Carolina Panthers, about 80 miles north in Charlotte,
N.C., have pitched in, donating practice jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headache, Logan said, has been trying to come up
with something for the players to do when they are not practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant deal trying to come up with something to keep
everybody from going crazy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the $250,000 East Carolina earned for playing
South Carolina will be eaten up by expenses for the extended stay
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   NEBRASKA'S EVANS: ``WHERE'S THE LOVE?''
</P>
<P>
   This week's reality check goes to former Nebraska running back
DeAngelo Evans, who quit the team last week in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was being used in the offense the way I
should have been,'' said Evans, who told coach Frank Solich in a
private meeting that ``unless some major changes were made,'' he
was through. Solich immediately offered to release Evans from his
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had second thoughts about his immature act, however, and
asked Solich if he could return. In the meantime, Solich asked key
people on the team what they thought. Their response: ``The guy is
selfish and has never been a team player. We're glad he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So Monday, Solich told Evans he was through at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Evans responded by saying publicly that the ``program is showing
me no love'' and that Solich was being ``stubborn and classless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, it's hard to understand why the Nebraska players didn't
want Evans back.
</P>
<P>
   JUST THINKING
</P>
<P>
   _ We should find out tonight if No. 8 Virginia Tech (2-0) is the
real deal when the Hokies host Clemson (1-1) on ESPN. Remember,
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer interviewed for the Clemson job
that went to Tommy Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of Tommy Bowden, his name has been one of the first
to come up should Alabama fire Mike DuBose. Bowden's father, Bobby,
wanted the Alabama job when Ray Perkins left in 1986. The school
hired Bill Curry instead. The Bowden family has roots in
Birmingham. Suppose Tommy Bowden gets the job and hires brother
Terry, a former Auburn coach, as offensive coordinator. Wouldn't
that be fun?
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia coach George Welsh obviously made somebody mad. He
opened the season with three consecutive ACC games, two on the
road, and Saturday he goes to BYU, a very tough place to play.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   _ After Texas Tech lost 21-14 to North Texas, which was
outscored 78-3 in its first two games, newspaper columnists began
calling for the resignation of Red Raider coach Spike Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez probably will watch Saturday's
big game with Michigan from the press box. The 52-year-old Alvarez
is scheduled to have knee-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ A sign that things really are changing at Oklahoma under new
coach Bobby Stoops: Before 1992, the Sooners had never averaged 20
passes a game for a season. In Saturday's 41-10 win over Baylor,
quarterback Josh Heupel completed 37 of 54 passes for 420 yards and
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since missing a field goal in the opener against Louisiana
Tech, Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski has hit nine
in a row, including all five tried last week against N.C. State.
Janikowski also had a tackle on a kickoff return that saved a
score.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   185: Nebraska's total offense last week against Southern
Mississippi, the Cornhuskers' worst offensive performance in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   12: Number of TD passes thrown by Kentucky's Dusty Bonner, to
lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   122: Victories at Air Force by coach Fisher DeBerry, pushing him
past Army's Red Blaik as the coach with the most wins at a service
academy.
</P>
<P>
   0-3: Notre Dame's record this season against the Big Ten, the
conference it shunned this summer after a membership offer was
extended.

`MINUS MAN' ADDS UP TO UNEXCEPTIONAL

an ingratiating young man who happens to be a serial killer, but

   Writer-director Hampton Fancher, who wrote the screenplays for
1982's ``Blade Runner'' and 1989's ``The Mighty Quinn,'' isn't
interested in exploitation _ or even chills (this is probably the
least violent serial-killer movie you'll ever see). He's primarily

the post office, where Vann attracts the attentions of a shy
co-worker (a more-vulnerable-than-usual Janeane Garofalo). And he
continues to practice his pastime, getting more bold and sloppy as
he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Another tag line for the movie is ``Conversation usually
follows,'' and that seems like a better boast, as the movie is
almost guaranteed to get you talking about what makes Vann and the
others tick (of course, the conversation might start with ``What
the $%&AMP;! was that all about?''). The movie's press notes
breathlessly brag about how it's a look behind the ``surface of
normality,'' as if that were an original concept. It wasn't even
original when Alfred Hitchcock, whom Fancher clearly admires,
addressed it decades ago in ``Suspicion'' and ``Shadow of a
Doubt.'' You can even catch variations on the theme in two other
movies this week, ``American Beauty'' and ``Mumford.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fancher does give ``The Minus Man'' a sustained moodiness,
marked by dark humor, and he gets good performances out of his
cast, especially Wilson and Cox. Singers Dwight Yoakam and Sheryl
Crow are impressive in a brief, booze-soaked prologue.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to be comfortable with a movie about a sympathetic
serial killer when real-life mass violence has recently hit so
close to home. Comfort isn't the point here, though; the point is
to get you talking. ``The Minus Man'' succeeds at that, but despite
the movie's pride in itself, it's unlikely that the conversation
will last the entire post-movie meal or long drive home.

WACO DISPUTE BREWS AS DANFORTH LETTER COMES TO LIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A territorial dispute is brewing between government
teams investigating the 1993 Waco standoff and whether federal
agencies tried to cover up details of the FBI's final assault on
the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Special counsel John Danforth, who was appointed by Attorney
General Janet Reno to examine the Waco case, cautioned Senate
investigators against undermining his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter disclosed Wednesday, Danforth complained that the
investigators had been dispatched to Texas ``without even troubling
to give me a call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had agreed that we would work together so that I
can fulfill my mission as special counsel,'' Danforth wrote in a
letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who is urging creation of a special Senate task force to
examine the Waco case as part of a larger investigation into the
Justice Department, acknowledged that Senate staff members had
traveled to Texas but ``not with full committee authorization.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were dispatched by Sen. Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican who is likely to oversee the special task
force if it is approved by Senate leaders from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement by Democratic leaders, Senate Republicans
are prepared for the full Judiciary Committee to re-examine the
FBI's tactics to end the Waco siege and whether the government
tried to cover up the use of potentially incendiary tear gar
canisters. The standoff ended with the Branch Davidian compound in
flames and more than 80 people killed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, met Tuesday and
Wednesday about the scope of the investigation. Their talks bogged
down over Danforth's complaint and Specter's reported plan to hire
Charles LaBella to lead the task force inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella is a former federal prosecutor who oversaw a Justice
Department examination of 1996 campaign fund-raising abuses and
publicly disagreed with Reno's decision not to turn the
investigation over to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and his aides did not return telephone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he was
not inclined to go along with Republicans on appointment of a
special task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder whether there is anything left to
investigate, after all these years and all these investigations,''
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (Republicans) want to pursue yet another investigation
within the confines of the Judiciary Committee, that's their
prerogative. We can't stop them,'' Daschle said. ``If they would
come to the Senate asking for extra money to do so, we'd have a
problem with that.''

MAYOR THREATENS TO CUT MUSEUM'S FUNDING OVER CONTROVERSIAL EXHIBIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani threatened Wednesday to cut
off all city subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum of Art unless it
cancels next week's opening of a British art exhibition that
features, among other works, a shark suspended in a tank of
formaldehyde, a bust of a man made from his own frozen blood and a
portrait of the Virgin Mary stained with a clump of elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has seen the show's catalog but not the
exhibition itself, derided the works of art generally as ``sick
stuff.'' But he singled out the portrait of the Virgin Mary as
particularly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating
somebody else's religion,'' he said. ``And therefore we will do
everything that we can to remove funding for the Brooklyn Museum
until the director comes to his senses and realizes that if you are
a government-subsidized enterprise, then you can't do things that
desecrate the most personal and deeply held views of people in
society. I mean, this is an outrageous thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor follows through on his threat, it could severely
hamper the museum's operations. The city gives the museum nearly $7
million a year in operating expenses _ nearly one-third of its $23
million budget _ and has reserved another $20 million in the budget
for capital improvements. The museum is the second largest in New
York, after the Metropolitan, and has a permanent collection of
more than 1.5 million objects.
</P>
<P>
   But if Arnold L. Lehman, the museum's director, was intimidated
by Giuliani's expression of outrage, he did not let on Wednesday.
He said he hoped to meet with the mayor ``to encourage him not to
take such an action,'' and added ``it is part of a museum's job to
support the right of artists to express themselves freely.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's angry reaction _ ``I'm offended,'' he said _ is
typical of the visceral response that the show, called ``Sensation:
Young British Artists From That Saatchi Collection,'' has generated
both in the United States and in Europe, where it opened to raves
and criticism at the Royal Academy of Arts in London two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the work of young British artists whose works are
displayed in museums around the world, the show is intended to
disturb, perturb and provoke thought. It was mounted at a cost of
$1 million and is the largest ever held by the Brooklyn Museum. The
show is financed in part by the Christie's, the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics and viewers in London argued that the content of
the show was offensive and intended to shock for shock's sake. A
few wryly suggested that it was designed primarily to increase the
value of the works amassed by Charles Saatchi, the London
advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   The most extreme reaction was to the artist Marcus Harvey's
depictions of Myra Hindley, who was convicted in the macabre
``moors murders'' of children in western England in the 1960s.
Protesters splattered ink and raw eggs on the painting, saying it
trivialized her victims' suffering and glorified her crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, felt that the exhibition captured an important
moment in the history of contemporary British art. Many dealers say
that they have waiting lists of collectors eager to buy the works
of those they believe to be the groundbreaking artists.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition attracted record crowds in London and at the
Hamburger Bahnof in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum sought to create the same kind of excitement
for the show's only North American engagement, which opens Oct. 2.
It announced that children under the age of 17 will have to be
accompanied by an adult. Even its promotions read like health
warnings on a cigarette pack: ``The contents of this exhibition may
cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety. If
you suffer from high blood pressure, a nervous disorder or
palpitations, you should consult your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the show's catalog that sparked the charged emotions
that publicity-hungry museums crave.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Damien Hirst is perhaps the exhibition's best known artist; his
work depicting a pair of cows sliced and suspended in a tank of
formaldehyde caused a stir at a Soho gallery three years ago. And
his shark-in-a-tank piece immediately attracted the ire of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Newkirk, the organization's president, dismissed Hirst as
a ``shock jock'' who ``is contributing to the slaughter of animals
for no other reason than his own aggrandizement.'' (Hirst denies
that he kills animals, saying they are already dead.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights, said that the catalog turned his stomach. ``I
think the whole city should picket the show,'' he said. ``This
exhibition is designed to shock, but instead it induces
revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the reaction of Giuliani that signaled both a
publicity coup for the museum and a threat to its own finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to do that privately and pay for that
privately, well that's what the First Amendment is all about,'' he
said. ``I mean, you can be offended by it and upset by it, and you
don't have to go see it, if somebody else is paying for it. But to
have the government subsidize something like that is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He went on to add a quick critique of Hirst's work. ``I though
that's what they did in biology laboratories,'' he said, ``not in
museums of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine later explained the mechanics of the
mayor's threat to cut off city funds. ``They get their checks on a
first-of-the-month basis,'' Levine said. ``Those checks will be
suspended unless this exhibit is canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would happen if the museum did not cancel the
show, Levine said: ``Then they're not going to get any more city
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a New York attorney who specializes in First
Amendment law, suggested that the mayor understands the amendment
that protects free expression ``precisely backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishing the Brooklyn Museum by seeking to remove its funding
because the mayor disapproves of what he perceives is the message
of its art is at war with the First Amendment,'' Abrams said. ``The
mayor has every right to denounce the exhibition. He should
understand, however, that the First Amendment limits what he can do
to retaliate against art of which he disapproves.''

</P>
<P>
   The struggle between artists trying to express themselves and
the government trying to define what it considers acceptably
artistic has intensified in recent years with disputes over several
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington backed down and
canceled an exhibition featuring the homoerotic art of Robert
Mapplethorpe and financed by the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the Supreme Court upheld a congressional decency
test for awarding federal arts grants, but only after a majority
interpreted a 1990 law as containing only ``advisory language''
that did not actually prohibit federal subsidies for indecent art.
In a majority opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court
suggested that if the law was invoked to impose ``a penalty on
disfavored viewpoints,'' it would violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case brought against the NEA by the
performance artist Karen Finley and three other artists. Two NEA
grants in 1989, for a retrospective of sexually explicit
photographs by Mapplethorpe and to the artist Andres Serrano, who
photographed a crucifix immersed in his own urine, had ignited a
furor that has never completely died down.
</P>
<P>
   Some museum directors were taken aback by Giuliani's threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled,'' Mimi Gaudieri, the director of the Association
of Art Museum Directors. ``We've been through this war before _ not
only with Mapplethorpe but with Serrano and others _ and we've won.
It just doesn't play in the political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ofili, a Roman Catholic whose portrait of the Virgin Mary
so offended the mayor and whose work often features clumps of
elephant dung, defended his work as being of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an altar boy I was confused by the idea of a holy Virgin
Mary giving birth to a young boy,'' he said. ``Now when I go to the
National Gallery and see paintings of the Virgin Mary, I see how
sexually charged they are. Mine is simply a hip-hop version.''

TECHNOLOGY SHARES LIFT NASDAQ, BUT DOW FALLS 74 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ High-technology stocks powered the Nasdaq market to a
sizable gain Wednesday, but other major indexes were down as
investors sorted through a confusing barrage of information and
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Some expressed fears that the dollar would skid further against
the yen, while others focused on a reassuring economic survey by
the Federal Reserve or on a partial rebound by the Dow Jones
industrial average after it fell to about 10,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern about money leaving our markets and going
abroad,'' said Tim Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston
Advisors, referring to the consequences of the dollar's fall on
foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 10,524.07, a loss of 74.40 points, or 0.7
percent, but that was better than its earlier loss of 104.47
points, to 10,494.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 30 Dow components lost ground, with Union Carbide,
Procter &AMP; Gamble, United Technologies and IBM each down around 2
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't gone down enough to turn the buyers on,'' said
Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fared somewhat better,
eking out a gain of 2.93 points, slightly more than 0.2 percent, to
1,310.51. But much of its strength was in the high-technology
sector. The broader malaise was reflected by a decline by a
majority of index stocks, 255, while 225 rose and 20 were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, there has been ``an extremely broad-based
pullback,'' said Timothy M. Stevenson, a senior portfolio manager
at First Capital Group. More than half the S&AMP;P 500 companies show
declines for 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tabulation by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, more
than 3,700 New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stocks have shown an
average decline, unweighted by capitalization, of 24 percent from
their 52-week highs, producing what some are calling a ``stealth''
bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot Wednesday was the Nasdaq, which climbed 37.06
points, or 1.31 percent, to 2,858.16.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   A better-than-expected profit report by 3Com Corp., the most
active issue of the day, helped send its shares up 1 5/16, to 28|,
and set a good tone for the computer-related sector. Microsoft rose
1 7/16, to 96 1/16; Qualcomm 7 13/16, to 190[; Yahoo 9 15/16, to
179{; Ebay 8{, to 149[, and America Online, 6[, to 91.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover on the Big Board swelled to 822.2 million from 785.3
million Tuesday as new 52-week lows swamped highs by 262 to 23.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones, 1,711 to 1,248.

 &HT;    A war of worlds _ and nerves
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Even world-class professionals who play with
clubs and balls to pay mortgages know that there's pressure in
regular golf tournaments and then there's Ryder Cup pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Regular tournament pressure can turn knees to Jell-O. Ryder Cup
pressure is a fist to the sternum and the inability to breathe _ a
fear that you might die standing over a putt, and the fear that you
might not.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 Ryder Cup at The Belfry in England, rookie Davis
Love III was so scared at the thought of hitting the first ball
that he was squirming with foursomes partner Tom Kite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try and get out of it so bad,'' Love said
Wednesday at The Country Club. ``On the walk up to the first tee, I
told Tom, `Don't you think you'd be better hitting off the odd
holes?' He said, `What are you trying to do, get out of it?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Davis teed off, he was a blithering idiot,'' Kite
said.
</P>
<P>
   Love then proceeded to blast a drive, as Kite recalls, ``10
miles down the first fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24 participants of the 33rd Ryder Cup would pay a lot for
such a guarantee when the event begins Friday morning. If there's
such a thing as a root canal to the nervous system, this is it.
Teammates and nations are watching. And the event has evolved into
golf's War of the Worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal, a two-time Masters champ, never forgets the
numbness that enters his body on the tee box. In 1987, he hit the
opening shot for the Europeans at Muirfield Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that stands still is the shaft of the club, and
that is before you take the club out of the bag,'' said Olazabal, a
six-time participant. ``The rest, everything shakes _ hands, legs,
absolutely everything. And that's how it is. There is nothing you
can do to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who opened at Oak Hill, said it
was ``the worst I've ever felt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tee the whole thing off at Oak Hill in 1995, and
that's as nervous as I want to be, thank you very much,''
Montgomerie said. ``I don't want to feel that again, because of the
expectation, having to hit the fairway and lucky enough doing so.
But I don't want to feel that pressure again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Jesper Parnevik said the pressure is worse as a
captain's pick. He remembered a snap hook from his first tee shot
at Valderrama two years ago. He's thankful he got the ball off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't really prepare yourself for the first
time you play in a Ryder Cup, because it's so much beyond any
tournament you play anywhere in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With seven rookies on their team, the Europeans could be more
susceptible to the pressures. But last time, they won with five.
And it's the Americans who are trying not to get three-peated.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal has tried to calm 19-year-old Sergio Garcia by
reminding him, and the other rookies, that it gets easier with age
and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be nervous on the first tee, just like you,''
Olazabal said.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik and American Jeff Maggert say the pressure makes it a
struggle to play a normal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing a regular tournament, you're just playing
for yourself,'' Olazabal said. ``Here, you're representing a
country. In our case, you're representing a continent, too. That
changes the whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you arrive with a troubled golf game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when pressure turns into bad pressure, fear and
panic,'' Olazabal said, ``and you don't want to be here.''

FEDS TARGET WEB `PAGE-JACKER' WHICH LOCKS COMPUTERS INTO PORN
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas)  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of a company that produces a popular
Internet game site for teen-agers was horrified last May when,
trying to call up his site, he got instead a screenful of lurid sex
scenes. Worse yet, he could not escape. Every time he tried to move
on, he got more pornographic scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that his Web site was not the only one victimized.
Some computer users searching for the Harvard Law Review, or trying
to find sites about ``Oklahoma tornadoes'' or ``news about Kosovo''
or ``child car seats,'' had the same experience. They were held
captive by pornographic sites from which they could not figure out
how to escape without turning off their computers.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 25 million Web pages, more than 2 percent of the
World Wide Web, may have been affected by the Internet fraud, which
investigators said was devised by an elusive Portuguese hacker and
an Australian pornography company.
</P>
<P>
   American and Australian investigators described the fraud at a
news conference here Wednesday and said that they had raided the
offices of the pornography company on the east coast of Australia
and had obtained an American court order to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These operators hijacked Web sites, kidnapped consumers and
held them captive,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal
Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ``They exposed
surfers, including children, to the seamiest sort of material and
incapacitated their computers so they couldn't escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme involved the cloning of legitimate Web pages,
including such sites as Audi, Paine Webber and the Japanese
Friendship Gardens. When computer users tried to reach those sites
using the Alta Vista search engine, which indexes the Web, they
were, in the new cyberspace parlance of investigators,
``page-jacked'' to a tawdry site run by the Australian company,
known to its customers as Kewl Images, Taboosisters.com,
Taboohardcore.com, or Tabooanimals.com.
</P>
<P>
   When computer users tried to escape those sites by clicking
``back'' or ``home'' buttons, they were instead directed to other
pornography sites, or ``mouse-trapped,'' investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the Portuguese hacker, Carlos Pereira, who
cannot be found, and the Australian company pulled off the scheme
by copying not only Web pages but also their so-called metatags.
The tags, invisible to viewers, provide key words and code that are
used to index the site for search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants stood to make money from the scheme in three
ways, the investigators said. They sold advertising on the Web
sites, almost exclusively from pornography companies, based on the
amount of traffic, and also offered viewers the chance to see more
Web sites by paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian company also used the scheme to inflate the value
of domain names, or Web addresses, by increasing the viewership of
those addresses through the page-jacking and mouse-trapping. The
company then tried to auction those domain names on an Internet
site at hundreds of times their original cost.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference at the Federal Trade Commission
Wednesday, Australian investigators who spoke through an Internet
video link from Canberra said they still did not know how much
money was made from the scheme. The Australian officials said they
are considering civil or criminal charges and had raided eight
locations, confiscating a variety of computers, routers and servers
integral to the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a federal judge in Virginia ordered many of
the sites run by the company and the Portuguese hacker off the Web
and directed them to stop copying legitimate web pages.
</P>
<P>
   American officials declined to give all the details of the
episode, saying they feared copycats. Even though the suspects are
all foreign individuals and companies, the officials said the U.S.
government became involved in the case because many victims were
Americans and American companies. The officials acted under the
Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive
practices affecting commerce. The content of the pornographic sites
was not a legal issue.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the scheme was a relatively new kind of
operation that did not involve traditional hacking, or the
defacement of a Web page. Rather, it involved the improper
diversion of consumers away from Web pages they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began after Angel Munoz, the president of
NewWorld.com, a popular Internet game site for teen-agers, was
preparing for a meeting of his board last May to consider a sale of
some of his company for more than $20 million. When Munoz tried to
see how accessible one of the company's sites was by using the Alta
Vista search engine, he was taken to a hard-core pornography site.
When he tried to get out of the page by clicking the back and home
buttons on his browser, more pornography sites appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Munoz recalled in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Munoz's company lawyers complained to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation in Dallas, which said it could do nothing about
the case. But after the MSNBC cable channel reported the incident,
the trade commission decided to start its own investigation. (Munoz
said the sale was never completed but for reasons unrelated to the
fraud.)
</P>
<P>
   Trade commission officials said the Australian company took the
pornographic sites down in June, but later in the summer put them
back up. Investigators said that when they were up, Alta Vista
received about 20 to 30 complaints each week. The complaints came
from diverse quarters. They included students on the Harvard Law
Review, mothers who had children on their laps when they were
page-jacked, and one man who said he had nearly lost his job when
his boss noticed he had lurid images on his computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Alta Vista said in an interview Wednesday that
pornography companies had repeatedly tried to trick computer users,
and that the company had taken steps to correct the problem by
carefully monitoring their index and by offering filters that can
be used to screen out objectionable sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support wholeheartedly what the FTC is doing in this
area,'' said David Emanuel, a spokesman for Alta Vista.
</P>
<P>
   But Munoz said Wednesday that when he contacted Alta Vista,
``They were not particularly helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Pereira is well known in the small community
of hackers and operated a site called Piratelynx.com. One official
said Wednesday that Pereira had boasted of his ability to ``control
Alta Vista.''
</P>
<P>
   But executives at Alta Vista said Wednesday that they had never
heard of him. His whereabouts are unknown, although the federal
judge in Virginia, recognizing that he was all but certain to
maintain a presence on the Internet, issued an unusual order that
permitted the government to serve him a summons by e-mail.

   TAICHUNG, Taiwan _ As she slept early Tuesday morning, Chien
Tsai-ping heard a loud explosion that knocked her out of bed.
Bleeding from her head and clutching a cross around her neck, she
dragged herself down a staircase and toward the moonlight that was
shining through large rips in the walls below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that it was God who saved me,'' Ms. Chien said.
``It was my beliefs that led me to the light.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least 79 other residents of her neighborhood, Dakun, died
as this city near the epicenter of the devastating earthquake on
Tuesday suffered some of the worst casualties and damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my home and my business for 20 years, and suddenly in
a few seconds it was totally destroyed,'' Ms. Chien said, pointing
to a lopsided building that seemed on the verge of collapse. ``What
am I supposed to do now?''
</P>
<P>
   That is a question that many quake victims are beginning to ask
themselves and their government as they begin to face a long and
painful process of rebuilding their shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the death toll had risen past 2,000, with an
additional 4,400 people injured and 2,600 believed still trapped in
the rubble, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands are homeless, and although electric power
was restored to most of the capital, Taipei, many communities in
northern and central Taiwan remain blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chien is living in a military shelter down the street from
her house, which is uninhabitable. At the shelter, which provides
three meals a day, she sleeps on the floor in a large tent with 100
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai Chin-wang, a street vendor and Ms. Chien's neighbor, said
although he was grateful that his wife and three children had
survived the quake's demolition of their house with them in it, he
wondered whether his family could survive the rigors of living in a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is good, but we are basically sleeping outdoors on
grounds, and we have no bathrooms and no privacy,'' Tsai said.
``This is no way to raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Liao, who moved his family into the shelter on Tuesday,
said, ``The government needs to do something to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the army, Linda Fang, said that the military
shelters were meant to be temporary and that many residents were
depressed because their lives had been ``turned upside down'' and
they were uncertain what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, thousands were left homeless by the quake and others
fearful of the strong aftershocks are living in tents in parks and
playgrounds across the island.
</P>
<P>
   After three strong aftershocks startled Taiwan Wednesday
morning, Khu Mu-hsiang found cracks in his apartment walls and
decided to move his family into a tent at Soowai Elementary School,
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary, and we are taking no chances,'' said Khu, who
arrived prepared with a portable radio, a flashlight and a small
cooking stove. ``My mother's house has already collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have nowhere to go. In Puli, in Nantau County,
also near the epicenter, the local government said 80,000 people
would spend the night in the streets because the earthquake had
destroyed their housing. Many inexpensive motels and government
shelters were filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   National and local officials said that they were aware of the
difficulties that survivors faced and that they were taking steps
to work on them. But the officials said their first priority was to
locate and rescue people who were pinned in the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, an international group of earthquake specialists,
including some from the United States, Russia, Japan and Israel,
began assisting in the rescue operation. Two U.S. rescuers found a
man in a caved-in apartment building in Touliu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty glad to see us,'' said Capt. Michael Reilly, one
of the U.S. workers who took four sniffing dogs to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous countries have promised to provide food and other
assistance, including China. Wednesday, the government thanked
Beijing for its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a good beginning to improving ties,'' said Su
Chi, chairman of the Taiwan government Mainland Affairs Council,
which oversees relations with Beijing. ``I hope we can work on this
basis and make efforts together to build up stable and peaceful
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local governments have acted on their own to ease the
victims' pain. In Taipei, the municipal government is paying for
more than 100 former residents of the collapsed Sungshan Hotel to
stay at other hotels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing number of bodies being recovered has overwhelmed
local governments, which are running out of body bags. Hospital
morgues have run out of room to store the bodies properly and are
placing them at roadsides taped in blue plastic sheets. Without
proper refrigeration in the September heat, the bodies are starting
to decompose, releasing foul odors.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread power shortages, even the bodies in morgues were
starting to decay. Many distressed relatives have been peering
through the plastic body bags to identify relatives, and some have
been delivering bags of ice to help preserve the bodies of their
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the police in Taichung, Richard Wu, said most
bodies would eventually be cremated, in accordance with the
families' wishes. He said cremations had been delayed because the
local government was waiting for the prosecutor's office to examine
the bodies and ascertain that no foul play was involved in the
deaths.

 &HT;    Gangs manage to get along in N.C. shelter
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBORO, N.C. _ Inside Tarboro High School, a hand-written
poster challenges the rumor that cases of tuberculosis have cropped
up among evacuees from Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer Hattie Stocks quickly challenges another. ``There is
no rioting here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since dangerous flooding prompted officials to turn
this low-slung brick high school into one of eastern North
Carolina's biggest emergency shelters, officials have turned this
last-resort stop into liveable quarters for more than 2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   It's been rough, shelter manager Dave Stone said, but it hasn't
been as bad as rumors around Tarboro have made it. There have been
no fights between gang members from Tarboro and neighboring
Princeville, no arrests, no altercations that shelter officials
couldn't handle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a community here for people who have lost their
homes,'' Tarboro police officer Bruce Edwards said. ``Tempers are
going to flare.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that two dozen law enforcement officers _ local police,
National Guardsmen, state Alcohol Law Enforcement agents _ are
patrolling the grounds and the hallways lined by purple lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they're looking for signals of gang activity, such
as young men wearing bandanas around their heads or hanging from
pockets. Tuesday, Stone watched as two young men approached three
others in a hallway. After pausing and exchanging looks, they moved
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelters are a neutral site,'' Stone said. ``We have security
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, some people scuffled for clothing being
tossed from the back of a rental truck. ``That's about the closest
thing to violence we've seen,'' said Kip Aldridge, a North Carolina
Alcohol Law Enforcement agent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, clothing and other supplies were pouring into the
school, and people lined up, waiting to pick through garments to
replace ones they had worn for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many organizations providing help to storm victims is
Atlanta-based Heel Quik, which conducts annual drives to collect
and repair shoes for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   All of Edgecombe County's water supply is considered unusable,
so shelter residents use portable toilets and showers, nippy with
dipping temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   People are sleeping on cots and mats in the gymnasium, or in
their vehicles parked in the jam-packed lots. On Wednesday, a stiff
breeze buffeted five gray tents identified as ``privacy shelters,''
tucked along a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has set up health services in Room 106 where,
during normal times, students learn Spanish. In the main office,
medical supplies line the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use the portable toilets, we know we will be going
home in three days,'' said Linda Hester, one of two dozen Southern
Baptist Convention volunteers from Georgia. ``How would you like to
know there is no time limit on how long you might stay?''
</P>
<P>
   Young boys picked up garbage on the grounds. One of them,
11-year-old Anthony Whitehead, said he's not yet comfortable after
spending a week at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sleeping around a lot of people I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a makeshift stab at home cooking, the Georgia volunteers
cooked chicken and dumplings on gas burners under tents. People
started moving through the lines by 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was nourishment and, for some, a distraction after days away
from home _ and many more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Flooded from her Tarboro home, Helen Burton, 38, expects to
remain in the shelter until she arranges more permanent housing.
``I'm upset, but there is nothing I can do about it,'' she said.

NBC LOADS ITS BIG GUNS FOR THURSDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are qualitative questions and cracks in the dam, but NBC's
Thursday night lineup remains the envy of the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC straps on most of its Thursday gear this week, with season
premieres of ``Friends,'' ``Jesse'' and ``Frasier,'' and the series
debuts of ``Stark Raving Mad'' and ``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing piece of equipment is ``ER.'' Its producer has
kindly consented to lending the 10 p.m. time slot to ``Third
Watch.'' No argument was recorded; John Wells is executive
producers for both shows.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Jesse'' _ horrors to Betsy! _ wasn't sent out for advance
preview. Maybe they thought the season opener was below the show's
high standards.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is bragging that Jesse (Christina Applegate) has a new
career and new friends this season. She killed her old friends and
drank their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of friends, not blood, ``Friends'' has unfinished
business from last spring.
</P>
<P>
   As last season ended, Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica
(Courteney Cox) entered a Las Vegas wedding chapel just as Ross
(David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) were making a
delirious exit.
</P>
<P>
   So we have jarring sitcom complications.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, Thursday night: ``We don't need to get divorced. We're
just going to get an annulment.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey (Matt LeBlanc): ``I don't think surgery is the answer
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Points for the dumb-Joey joke, but this business of pairing off
cast members in romantic cliff-hangers is growing stale. Correction
_ it is stale. And cutesy. And silly. The show is capable of
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' is the Thursday keystone at 9, despite the fact that
it will always have a narrower appeal than the late, great
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' begins its seventh season in excellent fettle, with
Rita Wilson guest-starring as the latest perfect woman for Frasier
(Kelsey Grammer).
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Frasier is the last person to realize that she's a
dead ringer for his own late mother. Soon, on a getaway to the
Crane family cabin, she's saying, ``Frasier, you've hardly touched
your chicken'' and ``Your father's right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good, Eddie pal fun, and anyone can call me for an
explanation or a rote apology for a horrid pun. Really, I'm sorry
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' is one of those shows that makes you think
the NBC brass was smoking crack. Uh, not that they really were.
</P>
<P>
   But did someone drive to Burbank and pitch this show as a comedy
about a nervous Nellie book editor (Neil Patrick Harris) who is
assigned to a horror novelist (Tony Shalhoub) with a morbid sense
of humor?
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a perfectly good idea for an odd little play _ albeit
an ``Odd Couple'' variation _ has been turned into a TV series.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Harris' neurotic character arrives at Shalhoub's
New York home to find the writer hanging by the neck from his
bedroom ceiling. Research. The show continues in this vein through
the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Harris (``Doogie Howser, M.D.'') and Shalhoub (``Wings'') make
the show far more palatable than it should be, by rights, but it's
hard to see how this slight comedy can blossom into a sustained
series.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing strange about ``Third Watch.'' Wells combines New York
police, paramedics and firefighters, all working the 3 to 11 p.m.
shift, into a vortex of predictable action.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is a little like listening to a siren for an hour.
Let's say there are lots of cast members, and short scenes, and
constant movement. It's ``ER'' on the streets, but apparently
without the compellingly interesting characters.
</P>
<P>
   A drunken driver causes a fatal accident. A woman goes into
labor on the subway. A kid takes a drug overdose. A baby is thrown
from a burning building. A rookie cop learns the ropes. A rookie
paramedic does the same. Someone gets shot on duty. Dissolve to
producer credits.
</P>
<P>
   I did find myself wondering what will happen next week. I mean,
what's left? The answer came from actor Skip Sudduth, in the role
of veteran cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from job to job solving problems as quick as we can, and
then we go to another problem,'' he tells his rookie partner.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that about sums it up. After Thursday, ``Third Watch'' can
be found in its regular 8 p.m. Sunday time slot.

RENO AND FEEH ORDER FBI TO BROADEN INQUIRY INTO CHINESE ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN and DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh have ordered federal agents to broaden their investigation
into evidence of Chinese nuclear espionage, moving far beyond the
government's earlier scrutiny of a scientist fired from Los Alamos
National Laboratory, government officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The widened inquiry ordered by Reno and Freeh will include
reopening a fundamental debate of whether American nuclear secrets
were stolen and, if so, where and how the theft may have occurred,
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal officials said the new effort is a tacit
acknowledgment that the initial federal espionage investigation of
Los Alamos was mishandled. The debate over the inquiry has badly
frayed relations between law-enforcement and Energy Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have been buffeted by complaints about the
conduct of the investigation. A presidential review board and
others have argued that the FBI and Energy Department focused
prematurely on Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born scientist dismissed from
the New Mexico laboratory in March for alleged security violations.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans in Congress have said that the bureau failed to
move aggressively enough to investigate Lee, and have also attacked
the Justice Department for rejecting the bureau's repeated requests
to wiretap and electronically monitor Lee early in its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials said, the government will go back to ``ground
zero'' to conduct a broader probe of the evidence that China
obtained secret design information about America's most advanced
nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. intelligence officials now say that classified
information on the W-88 that was apparently obtained by the Chinese
was available at many other government installations and at defense
contractors in addition to the Los Alamos design laboratory where
it originated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the FBI will conduct a more thorough investigation
of the evidence of espionage and search for alternative
explanations of what happened. The bureau was likely to investigate
military and contractor facilities to see if it can find another
possible source of the information besides Los Alamos, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials acknowledged that the FBI does not yet have any
new suspects who have become the targets of their espionage probe.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the decision to re-open the bureau's espionage
investigation will affect the government's decision whether to
prosecute Lee on charges that he mishandled classified materials, a
lesser charge than espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that Reno and Freeh coordinated their
decision to broaden the inquiry with the U.S. attorney for New
Mexico, John Kelly. Officials say Kelly has aggressively advocated
prosecuting Lee in New Mexico over his allegedly unauthorized
transfers of computer codes containing nuclear secrets from the
lab's classified computer network into an unclassified system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Energy Department, the FBI, the Justice
Department and Kelly's office met two weeks ago to reach an
agreement on how much classified material would be available to
prosecutors from the Energy Department for use as evidence in a
possible trial of Lee. Officials say progress has been made among
the agencies on the issue, but Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has
not made a final decision. Reno must give her approval before any
prosecution can go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has denied that he spied for China, and has said that he was
singled out by investigators because he is a Chinese-American. He
has acknowledged that he downloaded classified computer codes, but
said that he did so as a routine part of his job at Los Alamos to
protect the information from computer crashes. Lee has not been
charged with any crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government's investigation of China's apparent theft of
nuclear secrets has been under fire ever since the case became
public in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that China stole classified design information from the
W-88 led the Energy Department and the bureau to begin a
preliminary inquiry into the matter in 1995, and by June 1996, the
FBI had opened a full criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The initial inquiry looked at six Energy Department facilities,
including Los Alamos where the W-88 warhead were designed.
Archivists at Los Alamos told Energy Department officials that the
most important documents on the W-88 had not been distributed
beyond Los Alamos in the time when investigators believed the
espionage had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key pieces of evidence in the probe was a Chinese
government document, dated 1988, that included classified material
about the W-88 and which officials said they determined could not
have come from any public source.
</P>
<P>
   That convinced investigators that the espionage had occurred
between 1984, when the final design for the W-88 was approved, and
1988, when the Chinese document was dated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators came up with a list of about a dozen suspects who
had access to the information, had traveled to China or had other
contacts with Chinese scientists, and for whom security concerns
had already been raised.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI quickly focused on Lee, with whom they had
maintained a long and complicated relationship. Lee had previously
been both investigated by the bureau and had cooperated with it in
an investigation. He had also provided information, apparently
about Chinese scientists visiting Los Alamos, to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was already being investigated by the bureau when the
nuclear weapons inquiry began. In November 1995, the bureau
suspended that previous investigation and instead began to look at
Lee as part of the weapons case, according to an August report
issued by the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to focus so early in the investigation on Lee
has come under mounting criticism in recent months, from within the
government, from Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, in Los Angeles, and
from other outside critics. Now, officials say that they have
determined that the classified information included in the 1988
Chinese document had been distributed widely to other government
facilities and contractors by 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said on Wednesday that the classified material was
potentially available at hundreds of facilities by that time,
underscoring the belief that investigators focused too quickly on
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee first came to the FBI's attention as early as 1982, after
the government recorded a telephone call he made to a scientist who
had been dismissed from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
connection with an earlier investigation of China's theft of U.S.
neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee came under suspicion again as a result of a 1994 incident
that occurred while he was meeting with visiting Chinese nuclear
weapons scientists at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was told that Lee was embraced by Dr. Side Hu, a leading
scientist in China's nuclear weapons program, who then made it
clear to others in the meeting that Lee had been helpful to China's
nuclear program. The bureau began a counter-intelligence probe as a
result of that incident, which was later merged into the W-88
investigation.

MARKET PLACE: SPRINT'S FOREIGN-ENTANGLEMENT LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What in the world, literally, is going on with Sprint Corp. and
its Global One venture with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom of
Germany?
</P>
<P>
   As other big U.S. telecommunications companies, including AT&AMP;T
and Bell Atlantic have forged new alliances with foreign partners
in recent weeks, that old question once again hangs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   It has been obvious since the spring that Global One is on the
rocks, riven by competing priorities, an absence of coordination
and an unsurprising tension between German and French executives.
Just about everyone in the communications business, including many
executives involved in Global One, thought the troubled partnership
would be resolved or dissolved by now.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has happened. Propelled, perhaps, by frustration, no
less a Global One figure than Michel Bon, France Telecom's
chairman, has on separate occasions this month described the
situation as ``impossible'' and ``bedlam.'' Indeed, the three
companies have recently said they are discussing ways to end the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the circus has run so long appears to be that Global
One's fate has depended in large part on whether Sprint, with its
market value of $47 billion, is acquired outright by Deutsche
Telekom, which already owns a 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, Sprint conducted
extensive discussions with Deutsche Telekom during the summer about
such an acquisition. But those same executives say that the talks
have cooled significantly in recent weeks and may have hit a
roadblock altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the companies said that MCI Worldcom Inc.
has seriously considered a bid for Sprint. Such a deal would bring
MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance carrier, closer to AT&AMP;T
in the long-distance market; Sprint's national wireless operation
would also fill a hole in MCI Worldcom's portfolio. Sprint may have
backed away from Deutsche Telekom to assess MCI Worldcom's
interest, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the breakdown of the Deutsche Telekom merger talks
appears to be an attempt to separate those discussions from the
Global One negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues are linked because the German and French
companies each own 10 percent of Sprint, and each has a seat on
Sprint's board. Neither company may raise its stake in Sprint
without the consent of Sprint management.
</P>
<P>
   More important, even if Sprint were to invite Deutsche Telekom
to raise its stake, France Telecom would be entitled to increase
its own stake by an identical amount. The arrangement gives France
Telecom an effective, if not explicit, veto over any Deutsche
Telekom acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   That power has proved crucial in at least two ways, and may even
have fueled the discord within Global One, which had about $1.1
billion in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to Global One, Deutsche Telekom
was interested in acquiring Sprint last winter. France Telecom
vetoed it, perhaps even before Sprint knew of Deutsche Telekom's
interest.
</P>
<P>
   So, the executives said, when Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's
chairman, decided to bid for Telecom Italia, Italy's dominant phone
company, this spring, he did not inform France Telecom. Sommer was
piqued, they said, and perhaps fearful that France Telecom would
try to block the Telecom Italia move as it had his earlier
ambitions for Sprint. The German and French companies have a
venture in Italy that competes against Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's bid for the Italian carrier, coupled with the
lack of advance notice, sent Bon into a rage, executives close to
the alliance said. France Telecom sued Deutsche Telekom, and the
collapse of Global One seemed all but certain.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom all declined to
comment Wednesday. But Klaus Czerwinski, a Global One spokesman,
said, ``It is very unlikely that Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom will stay in one alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The three partners are now haggling over Global One's
international network and customers. France Telecom wants those
assets for itself, and has been insisting on them as the price for
its approval of any acquisition of Sprint by Deutsche Telekom,
executives close to the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   For Sprint, the executives said, the loss of the Global One
assets would significantly undermine the argument for merging with
Deutsche Telekom in the first place: to form an international
communications powerhouse with operations beyond Germany and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street speculation that such a deal is in the works has
raised Sprint shares from a low of $42.625 on Sept. 1 to to
$54.4375 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom appears less interested in the Global One
assets than either its French or U.S. partners are. In fact, it may
form an international operation on its own, according to executives
close to Global One, by acquiring either a big international
carrier like Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda or Equant NV of the
Netherlands, or a string of smaller carriers like RSL
Communications Ltd. of Bermuda and Global Telesystems Group.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, no partner wants to walk away from Global One
empty-handed. And as the companies circle each other, the real
losers may be Global One's sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the recent turmoil among the partners has not
made the Global One operation any more disjointed than it was
already. But some executives close to the alliance say that some of
the big multinational companies that are the venture's intended
clients have clearly become wary of signing up with an alliance
distinguished chiefly by infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint seems especially cognizant of the problem, appearing
willing to put acquisition talk aside to deal with Global One
first. According to people close to the venture, William T. Esrey,
Sprint's chairman, has called a special board meeting for next week
at which he intends to read the riot act to Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom, encouraging them to resolve their differences in
the interest of at least preserving Global One as a viable
commercial entity.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies say they intend to fix the Global One
problem by year's end. If they do not, some alliance executives
fear, there may not be much of a Global One to fix.

NBC LOADS ITS BIG GUNS FOR THURSDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are qualitative questions and cracks in the dam, but NBC's
Thursday night lineup remains the envy of the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC straps on most of its Thursday gear this week, with season
premieres of ``Friends,'' ``Jesse'' and ``Frasier,'' and the series
debuts of ``Stark Raving Mad'' and ``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing piece of equipment is ``ER.'' Its producer has
kindly consented to lending the 10 p.m. time slot to ``Third
Watch.'' No argument was recorded; John Wells is executive
producers for both shows.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Jesse'' _ horrors to Betsy! _ wasn't sent out for advance
preview. Maybe they thought the season opener was below the show's
high standards.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is bragging that Jesse (Christina Applegate) has a new
career and new friends this season. She killed her old friends and
drank their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of friends, not blood, ``Friends'' has unfinished
business from last spring.
</P>
<P>
   As last season ended, Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica
(Courteney Cox) entered a Las Vegas wedding chapel just as Ross
(David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) were making a
delirious exit.
</P>
<P>
   So we have jarring sitcom complications.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, Thursday night: ``We don't need to get divorced. We're
just going to get an annulment.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey (Matt LeBlanc): ``I don't think surgery is the answer
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Points for the dumb-Joey joke, but this business of pairing off
cast members in romantic cliff-hangers is growing stale. Correction
_ it is stale. And cutesy. And silly. The show is capable of
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' is the Thursday keystone at 9, despite the fact that
it will always have a narrower appeal than the late, great
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' begins its seventh season in excellent fettle, with
Rita Wilson guest-starring as the latest perfect woman for Frasier
(Kelsey Grammer).
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Frasier is the last person to realize that she's a
dead ringer for his own late mother. Soon, on a getaway to the
Crane family cabin, she's saying, ``Frasier, you've hardly touched
your chicken'' and ``Your father's right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good, Eddie pal fun, and anyone can call me for an
explanation or a rote apology for a horrid pun. Really, I'm sorry
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' is one of those shows that makes you think
the NBC brass was smoking crack. Uh, not that they really were.
</P>
<P>
   But did someone drive to Burbank and pitch this show as a comedy
about a nervous Nellie book editor (Neil Patrick Harris) who is
assigned to a horror novelist (Tony Shalhoub) with a morbid sense
of humor?
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a perfectly good idea for an odd little play _ albeit
an ``Odd Couple'' variation _ has been turned into a TV series.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Harris' neurotic character arrives at Shalhoub's
New York home to find the writer hanging by the neck from his
bedroom ceiling. Research. The show continues in this vein through
the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Harris (``Doogie Howser, M.D.'') and Shalhoub (``Wings'') make
the show far more palatable than it should be, by rights, but it's
hard to see how this slight comedy can blossom into a sustained
series.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing strange about ``Third Watch.'' Wells combines New York
police, paramedics and firefighters, all working the 3 to 11 p.m.
shift, into a vortex of predictable action.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is a little like listening to a siren for an hour.
Let's say there are lots of cast members, and short scenes, and
constant movement. It's ``ER'' on the streets, but apparently
without the compellingly interesting characters.
</P>
<P>
   A drunken driver causes a fatal accident. A woman goes into
labor on the subway. A kid takes a drug overdose. A baby is thrown
from a burning building. A rookie cop learns the ropes. A rookie
paramedic does the same. Someone gets shot on duty. Dissolve to
producer credits.
</P>
<P>
   I did find myself wondering what will happen next week. I mean,
what's left? The answer came from actor Skip Sudduth, in the role
of veteran cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from job to job solving problems as quick as we can, and
then we go to another problem,'' he tells his rookie partner.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that about sums it up. After Thursday, ``Third Watch'' can
be found in its regular 8 p.m. Sunday time slot.

STREET PROTESTS AGAINST MILOSEVIC DRAW FEWER SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Street protests intended to oust Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic appeared to falter on their second
day, giving some comfort to a government that was deeply shaken by
the loss of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people turned out in fine weather for the rally here
in the capital, compared to some 20,000 on Tuesday. In Nis, about
8,000 came, compared with 20,000 the day before; in Kragujevac,
5,000 came, half of Tuesday's total. In Novi Sad, 5,000 came,
compared with some 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Alliance for Change, a loose coalition of
opposition parties dominated by the Democratic Party of Zoran
Djindjic, insisted Wednesday night that the rallies and the
campaign to oust Milosevic would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-day-long protests of the winter of 1996-97 also started
small, they said, and built slowly to large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting time for Thursday's rally was moved up two
hours, to 4 p.m., to catch people in town before they head home,
and some officials said there were already discussions of how to
play down the importance of the rallies, in order not to discredit
the Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, speaking Wednesday at the Belgrade rally, said
somewhat plaintively: ``We are being asked whether the people have
any more energy'' for the protests after 10 years of hardship and
war under Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of energy, he said, ``is natural. But if the people don't
find this energy we are doomed. This is the last battle, not just
for our generation, but for our children and grandchildren. We have
no other option but to be here every day, rain or sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance for Change officials said later that they might move
more quickly to announce an alternative, transitional government,
to be headed by the respected former central bank governor,
Dragoslav Avramovic, 79, or move to more confrontational tactics,
like a general strike or road blockages, or an agreement by
opposition-controlled cities to stop recognizing the authority of
Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   And they seemed, in comments Wednesday, to be moving closer to
the idea of using the rallies to press for early elections under
fair conditions, the route favored by the largest opposition party,
the Serbian Renewal Movement, which has dissociated itself from
these rallies in the hope that they will fail.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's leader, Vuk Draskovic, has said that if the
opposition parties could agree on conditions for a free and fair
ballot, he would join the protests in order to press Milosevic to
call elections. The Alliance for Change, however, has insisted that
Milosevic resign first.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, however, Djindjic said that Milosevic would
steal any election unless he were forced, by mass street
demonstrations, to organize a truly fair vote. And Avramovic, in
his speech, said that he will try to reach an agreement with other
opposition parties on demands for free and fair elections and the
country's democratization.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Avramovic is clearly trying to unite the
opposition, understanding that without Draskovic, however disliked
he may be by the Alliance for Change, the effort is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   There is an ongoing round table discussion among opposition
parties to try to agree on conditions for a fair election _
Djindjic boycotted 1997 elections as unfair, acting then against
U.S. advice, while Draskovic took part, lending them legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little indication that the Milosevic government
feels any need just now to give anything to the opposition, which
remains divided.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic Party official said despairingly Wednesday
night: ``Everybody knows they have empty refrigerators, empty
factories, empty pockets and an empty life. No one wants this
Milosevic government, but they're afraid to push it out. They want
someone else to do it _ they want me to do it. But I can't do it by
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Grubacic, an independent analyst close to Djindjic,
noted Wednesday that the numbers of people swelled for a post-rally
march with whistles past state television, Parliament and the state
newspaper Politika. ``People want action, not these boring
speeches,'' he said. ``People seem to be waiting for someone to
throw the first stone.''
</P>
<P>
   While the police stayed in the background in Belgrade and major
cities, they banned rallies planned for Bor and Cacak, saying that
they lacked necessary documents.
</P>
<P>
   State television took a gloating tone as it described the
opposition's lack of support, though it also gave artificially low
turnout figures. It continued its attack on the Alliance for Change
for being American puppets, in the pay of Washington, who were
acting unpatriotically in order to finish what NATO started with
its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   State television calls the Alliance for Change the ``Alliance
for NATO'' and the rallies for Milosevic's ouster ``a continuing of
the aggression by other means.''

CHAIRMAN ADMITS BANK'S `LAPSE' IN JUDGMENT IN RUSSIAN LAUNDERING
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Slugged earlier as RUSSIA-CONGRESS; With RUSSIA-BANK) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Bank of New York said Wednesday
that suspicious activity in nine accounts at the core of the
Russian money laundering scandal was not stopped because the
accounts were held by the husband of a highly regarded bank
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Renyi, the chairman and chief executive, told
lawmakers that allowing the accounts held by Peter Berlin, a
Russian-born businessman who is married to a bank vice president,
Lucy Edwards, to remain ``open and active without sufficient
questioning was a lapse on the part of the Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he said, the activity in the accounts was
``unremarkable.'' But when the flow of money through the accounts
jumped sharply, lower-level bank supervisors who monitored the
activity failed to notify their superiors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions were not pursued with sufficient vigor or
follow-through, and the questioners relied too heavily on the fact
that Mr. Berlin was married to a well-regarded bank officer,''
Renyi said. ``They did not see the obvious conflict that we might
see in hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, Renyi said $7.5 billion had flowed
through accounts Berlin opened in 1996, in the name of a company
called Benex. Investigators say that some of the money may be from
legitimate and legal transactions, but they also say they suspect
that billions of dollars may have come from organized crime,
corporate embezzlement and, possibly, diverted foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has been cooperating in the investigation by the FBI
for a year. Neither it nor any of its employees has been formally
charged with any wrongdoing. However, the bank has fired two
employees, including Ms. Edwards, and suspended a third. Ms.
Edwards and her husband have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi's testimony capped a second day of hearings by the House
Banking Committee into allegations of Russian corruption and money
laundering. The Bank of New York has been the leading American bank
in Moscow specializing in international services for Russian banks
and businesses. It was widely used to handle payments between
Russian companies and foreign suppliers, and by people who wanted
to send money out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi said the bank conducts business with about 160 Russian
banks, and that $3.7 billion a day in transactions flowed through
accounts that Russian banks maintain at the Bank of New York, a
small fraction of the $600 billion a day from all of the bank's
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the recent disclosures, Renyi said the bank was
reviewing whether to continue its business with Russian banks.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony and in responses to questions, Renyi sought to
portray the bank, founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, as a
victim of poor judgment by low-level employees and a global
payments system that puts priority on speed rather than knowing
whether the electronic money transfers are legal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers sounded dubious. ``The fact an incident would occur at
such a respected bank is frightening to me,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And while Renyi was careful not to accuse Ms. Edwards of any
wrongdoing, he seemed to be drawing a legal curtain between her and
the bank. Ms. Edwards, who worked in London, was dismissed shortly
after the federal inquiry became public last month, for ``gross
misconduct,'' according to a person with direct knowledge of her
dismissal, including falsification of bank records and for never
telling the bank that she was married to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi's remarks Wednesday marked the first time that a senior
bank official attributed the bank's lax response to the fact some
employees were comforted by the fact that Ms. Edwards was married
to Berlin, and had referred the accounts to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a person with knowledge of the dismissal said the bank was
offering two contrasting stories: Ms. Edwards had failed to
disclose her marriage on an official bank form she submitted
annually, but some bank employees were nonetheless aware that her
husband was Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman
of the committee, Renyi also confirmed reports that a son-in-law of
Russia President Boris Yeltsin had assets in accounts at the bank's
branch in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say they are examining the accounts in
their widening money-laundering inquiry.

`ER' PRODUCER DELIVERS A SPINOFF _ STAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After making ``ER'' a respected drama and a ratings winner,
producer John Wells has been trying to duplicate the creative magic
elsewhere, with little success. ``Trinity,'' a cop-based family
drama, did not win respect or ratings last season and was shown the
door. This year, Wells got a hand in NBC's ``The West Wing'' as an
executive producer (although it's considered Aaron Sorkin's baby),
and two more dramas are reportedly waiting on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he revisits his ``ER'' stomping grounds to introduce
yet another series, and in a Hollywood where you're only as good as
the gap between hits, it's not surprising that ``Third Watch'' is
as close to an ``ER'' spinoff as it can be, without Wells and NBC
actually calling it one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' which will air Sundays, is like ``ER: Life on
the Street.'' It focuses on firefighters, paramedics and cops who
work the 3-to-11 p.m. shift. You've seen these folks before. These
are the no-name heroes who zip in and out of ``ER,'' barking orders
about vital signs. Now we get them front and center and see how
they patch up the injured before wheeling them through hospital
corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has concocted another series that moves like a runaway
freight train, crunching everything in its way. Story lines are
soapy and layered, and there's a similar multiple-lead character
structure. Michael Beach, whom you'll remember as Jeanie Boulet's
HIV-positive ex-husband on ``ER,'' seems to be in the position to
serve as the show's center. That would be refreshing, particularly
this season, considering all the fuss over the lack of minority
leads.
</P>
<P>
   Beach plays a paramedic, a nurturer, the levelheaded team leader
called ``Doc.'' Bobby Cannavale and Kim Raver are the others, and
both are holdovers from Wells' ``Trinity.'' Everyone else is
relatively unknown and will have to fend for themselves in getting
good story lines.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a problem. As it was in the early days of
``ER,'' narrative is pared to the bare essentials. There are
veteran cops, green rookies, hotheads. A paramedic in love with
another paramedic whose ex-husband works with them. ``Why did we
break up anyhow?'' he wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk. Talk that's quick and terse and to the
point since, well, these people rarely have time.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran cop to rookie: ``What are we doing out here?''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: ``Enforcing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: ``No. We're solving problems. We go from job to job,
solving problems as quickly as we can. Then we come up, go to
another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening episode alone, a woman drops her baby from a
burning high-rise apartment building, a paramedic is sprayed with
gunfire, a woman gives birth on a subway train, a paramedic rushes
to her ambulance shouting, ``I love this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of ``Third Watch'' is borrowed, there are no
stylistic breakthroughs, and the dialogue is straight from the
Heros' Handbook. It's entertaining, at least. Which is more than
half the battle in a season in which you'll be shocked as to what
is being passed off as such. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also new Thursday: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Neil Patrick Harris, Tony Shalhoub
</P>
<P>
   Eccentric bestselling horror writer Ian Stark (Shalhoub from
``Wings'') is driving his neurotic editor (''Doogie Howser M.D.'s''
Harris) crazy. How? Practical jokes, mostly. And touching him. Like
putting his hand on his shoulder. Harris' Henry McNeely is a
bookish little creep who can't handle germs or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   It's a run-of-the-mill buddy comedy that will have to get much
better than its pilot to survive three years, which is how long NBC
Thursday-night comedies seem to last these days. One year for NBC
to notice that it's a clunker, another year while it switches to
another night, and a third year for it to get pummeled in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' could also refer to anyone who decides to
make this ``must see TV.'' Do yourself a favor and watch ``Action''
on Fox.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: NOSY PARKER LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A state sells its driver's license records to a
stalker; he selects his victim _ a Hollywood starlet _ from the
photos and murders her.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone company sells a list of calls; an extortionist
analyses the pattern of calls and blackmails the owner of the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital transfers patient records to an insurance affiliate,
which turns down a policy renewal.
</P>
<P>
   A bank sells a financial disclosure statement to a borrower's
employer, who fires the employee for profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet browser sells the records of a nettie's searches to
a lawyer's private investigator, who uses ``cookie''-generated
evidence against the nettie in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Such invasions of privacy are no longer far-out possibilities.
The first listed above, the murder of Rebecca Schaeffer, led to the
Driver's Privacy Protection Act. That federal law enables motorists
to ``opt out'' _ to direct that information about them not be sold
for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But even that opt out puts the burden of protection on the
potential victim, and most people are too busy or lazy to initiate
self-protection. Far more effective would be what privacy advocates
call opt in _ requiring the state or business to request permission
of individual customers before selling their names to practitioners
of ``target marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the difference between opt in and opt out is
the difference between a door locked with a bolt and a door left
ajar. But in a divided appeals court _ under the strained rubric of
commercial free speech _ the intrusive telecommunications giant U S
West won. Its private customers and the public are the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate mergers and technologies of E-commerce and electronic
surveillance are pulverizing the walls of personal privacy.
Belatedly, Americans are awakening to their new nakedness as
targets of marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Your bank account, your health record, your genetic code, your
personal and shopping habits and sexual interests are your own
business. That information has a value. If anybody wants to pay for
an intimate look inside your life, let them make you an offer and
you'll think about it. That's opt in. You may decide to trade the
desired information about yourself for services like an e-mail box
or stock quotes or other inducement. But require them to ask you
first.
</P>
<P>
   We are dealing here with a political sleeper issue. People are
getting wise to being secretly examined and manipulated and it rubs
them the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians sense that a strange dissonance is agitating their
constituents. But most are leery of the issue because it cuts
across ideologies and party lines _ not just encrypted
communication versus national security, but personal liberty versus
the free market.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there has been such Sturm und Drang around the
Financial Services Act of 1999. Most pols think it is bogged down
only because of a turf war between the Treasury and the Fed over
who regulates the new bank-broker-insurance mergers. It goes
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill 343 to 86 to make ``pretext calling'' by
snoops pretending to be the customer a federal crime, plus an ``opt
out'' that puts the burden on bank customers to tell their banks
not to disclose account information to marketers. The bank lobby
went along with this.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a version without privacy protection because
Banking Chairman Phil Gramm said so. But in Senate-House
conference, Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama (who already
toughened drivers' protection at the behest of Phyllis Schlafly's
Eagle Forum and the ACLU) is pressing for the House version. ``
`Opt out' is weak,'' Shelby tells me, ``but it's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   The groundswelling resentment is in search of a public champion.
The start will gain momentum when some presidential candidate
seizes the sleeper issue of the too-targeted consumer. Laws need
not always be the answer: to avert regulation, smart businesses
will compete to assure customers' right to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian principle is plain: excepting legitimate needs
of law enforcement and public interest, control of information
about an individual must rest with the person himself. When the
required permission is asked, he or she can sell it or trade it _
or tell the bank, the search engine and the Motor Vehicle Bureau to
keep their mouths shut.

SOLID `THIRD WATCH' SUFFERS AN ABUNDANCE OF DEJA VU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Wells, one of the creative honchos behind the magic of
``ER,'' tried to duplicate it last season with ``Trinity,'' an
ensemble drama about an Irish-American family. ``Trinity'' sank
quickly in a puddle of Celtic melancholia, but Wells is obviously
undeterred. This season, his production company is back with two
more ensemble pieces for NBC: Aaron Sorkin's ``The West Wing,''
which premiered Wednesday night, and his own ``Third Watch,''
debuting Thursday at 10 in the coveted ``ER'' slot before moving to
Sunday nights at 8 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious combination of ``ER'' and ``Hill Street Blues,''
``Third Watch'' encompasses the lives of paramedics, firefighters
and police officers staffing the 3-to-11 p.m. shift in New York
City. The cast is solid, the writing OK, but the first two episodes
of ``Third Watch'' really don't take us anywhere we haven't been
before. I mean, who doesn't know that public-safety work in the big
city is dangerous? People get shot, spouses worry, partners sulk,
junkies squeal, etc.
</P>
<P>
   As ensemble dramas go, ``Third Watch'' isn't bad, but it's
nothing special. The crucial task for Wells and his collaborators
will be making us care about this large group of people _ the core
ensemble totals nine _ the way we've come to embrace the detectives
on ``NYPD Blue,'' the doctors and nurses on ``ER,'' the lawyers on
``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch'' attempts to do it by emphasizing the choices
people make every day _ decisions made unconsciously at times, but
often freighted with huge implications. It might be as simple as
entering a building, turning right to avoid crossing traffic, going
out for coffee. One second, things are normal; the next second, a
life is changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Early favorites on the likability meter are Monte ``Doc'' Parker
(Michael Beach), John ``Sully'' Sullivan (Skipp Sudduth) and Faith
Yokas (Molly Price). Parker is a paramedic, Sullivan and Yokas are
police officers. Together, they form the moral compass of the
group, but while their needle may be pointing to right choices, the
possibility remains that viewers of America, trudging through a
forest of more than 40 new shows, will encounter ``Third Watch''
and say, ``Been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who's lost, that's a good thing. But for someone
seeking new and different, it's an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   Third Watch. Hourlong ensemble drama about New York City police
officers, paramedics and firefighters working the 3-11 p.m. shift.
Starring Michael Beach, Coby Bell, Bobby Cannavale, Eddie Cibrian,
Molly Price, Kim Raver, Anthony Ruivivar, Skipp Sudduth and Jason
Wiles. Season premiere Thursday night on NBC; show moves to its
regular day Sunday. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

BANK EXECUTIVE ADMITS TO `LAPSE' IN WAKE OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
ACCUSATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bank of New York's top executive acknowledged
Wednesday that ``a lapse'' by the bank enabled Russian businessmen
to funnel several billion dollars through several accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian businesses and individuals, some allegedly linked to
organized crime, are suspected of channeling as much as $10 billion
through the bank, and the FBI and Treasury departments are
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Large volumes of money that moved through the bank over the past
three years drew ``red flags,'' bank president Thomas Renyi told
the House Banking Committee, which is holding hearings on the
allegations. ``But the questions (about the account) were not
pursued with sufficient vigor or follow-through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi mostly defended the bank, emphasizing it has not been
charged with any wrongdoing. ``No relevant authorities have
asserted that the Bank of New York has engaged in money laundering
or violated any other law,'' he said. ``Neither the bank nor any of
its customers have lost any money as a result of the activities in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, who spoke before
Renyi did at the hearing, said he could not comment on the case.
``This has been and will continue to be a complex and painstaking
investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of corruption broke one month ago, after federal
authorities discovered about $4.2 billion was funneled through
several accounts last year. A top executive, Lucy Edwards, helped
set up the accounts for her husband, Peter Berlin, a Russian who
represented himself as a small-businessman working out of New York,
according to Renyi.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have contacted employees involved in the case,
Renyi acknowledged Wednesday, but no charges have been filed. So
far, the firm fired Edwards and suspended one other employee.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal broke, the Bank of New York and government
officials have fashioned new anti-money laundering measures, aimed
to keep better track of foreign businesses and individual bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that money from the International Monetary Fund was
diverted to the Bank of New York has prompted calls for tighter
controls on the way banks do business with foreign correspondents.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday no information has
surfaced that proves IMF funds were moved to the New York Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also told the committee that the United States will urge
withholding international loans from Russia until its leaders
implement more reforms to curb money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the general state of Russian crime, Robinson said
current law has fallen behind the pace and ability of crime
organizations to launder money. One problem is that ``only a very
limited number of foreign offenses are now qualified as specified
unlawful activities,'' he said. Current laws, for example, do not
cover public corruption against foreign governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Thursday will introduce a bill, which
Robinson said would enable federal prosecutors to gain more access
to foreign business records and improve the government's ability to
prosecute banks that knowingly accept criminal money.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi cautioned the government not to overreact to this
particular case. The bank has developed internal programs to thwart
criminal-related transactions, he said. A new Anti-Money Laundering
Committee, for example, reviews unusual account activity and
reports directly to the bank's board of directors. The bank now
works with outside consultants to monitor the flow of funds through
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers craft too strict of laws, Renyi said foreign banks
may ``simply drive would-be wrongdoers to less stringent points of
entry into the system,'' he said. ``Any policy action that would
reduce the importance and attractiveness of the U.S. dollar as the
currency of choice for international trade ... would place the
United States at a competitive disadvantage.''

RESEARCHERS TURN MARROW INTO MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In unexpected testimony to the versatility of the body's cells,
researchers have found they can make bone marrow cells turn into
muscle, causing mice with muscular dystrophy to produce correctly
working muscle cells. The experiment suggests that a form of bone
marrow transplant _ a well established surgical procedure _ could
in principle treat patients with a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate relevance of the new result is for muscular
dystrophy, a set of diseases said by the Muscular Dystrophy
Association to affect 250,000 Americans. Researchers have tried to
treat the disease with injections of normal muscle cells from a
relative, but the cells do not spread beyond the site of injection.
</P>
<P>
   In a report the Thursday issue of the journal Nature, biologists
from Children's Hospital in Boston say they gave bone marrow
transplants from normal mice to dystrophic mice, and that 12 weeks
later about 10 percent of the muscle fibers in the diseased animals
were making the correct form of dystrophin, the protein that is
genetically defective in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   The treated mice did not appear stronger, said Dr. Louis M.
Kunkel, one of the authors of the research, because a 10 percent
replacement is not therapeutically useful. But Kunkel and his
colleague, Dr. Richard C. Mulligan, believe their work suggests
ways of developing possible treatments. That view is shared by
other experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integration of these cells with the muscle cells is a
great finding because it really does open up the possibility of
therapy for these patients,'' said Dr. Mark F. Pittenger, a
biologist at Osiris Therapeutics in Baltimore who is working on
muscle replacement techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding extends the fast growing body of knowledge about
stem cells, the long hidden source of the body's ability to renew
and repair its tissues. Unlike mature cells, which are permanently
committed to their fate, stem cells can both renew themselves as
well as create new cells of whatever tissue they belong to.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan said that a colleague, Dr. Margaret A. Goodell, learned
through a lucky discovery five years ago how to isolate a special
sub-population of the bone marrow stem cells that form the blood
system. These cells may be ancestral to the ordinary bone marrow
stem cells and thus possess greater versatility, though this has
not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   It is these presumed ancestral bone marrow stem cells that were
used to treat the dystrophic mice, which are animals whose
dystrophin gene has been removed so as to mimic the human
condition.
</P>
<P>
   In a parallel experiment, the researchers also used Dr.
Goodell's technique to isolate ancestral-type stem cells from
muscle. The muscle-derived stem cells could also repopulate both
the bone marrow and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of this complex experiment have yet to be worked
out, such as the exact relationship between the ancestral cells
derived from bone marrow and from muscle, and their relationship to
mesenchymal stem cells, the known progenitor of muscle. Pittenger
said he believed the ancestral-type cells must first develop into
mesenchymal stem cells before forming muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kunkel and Mulligan hope to develop treatments for muscular
dystrophy, though in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel, who has been studying muscular dystrophy for 18 years,
succeeded in isolating the dystrophin gene in 1986. He believes the
ideal treatment suggested by the new approach would be to take a
sample of a patient's own muscle, isolate the ancestral muscle stem
cells and treat them outside the body with the correct version of
the dystrophin gene. The treated cells would then be returned to
the patient without danger of immune rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulligan fears that the patient's own muscle cells may be
compromised in some way and that ``there's a far greater hope that
if you make use of the bone marrow compartment you might have a
ready source of cells.'' He envisages taking the patient's bone
marrow cells and trying to repair the defective gene.

UTILITY AGREES TO REMOVE DAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A giant electrical utility will remove a large dam
in Washington state rather than pay the millions of dollars it
would cost to make the dam less harmful to fish.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the Condit Dam on the White Salmon River, which
flows from the glaciers of Mount Adams into the canyons of the
Columbia River, will mark the first removal of a large dam in
Washington state, and the 125-foot-high dam is thought to be the
tallest dam ever removed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Wednesday to remove the dam in seven
years, which must be approved by federal regulators, gives a boost
in credibility and momentum to a national dam-removal movement
still celebrating last month's breaching of the Edwards Dam in
Augusta, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Dam-removal advocates, including Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, say that many of the nation's large dams do more
environmental harm than economic good. They are eying a number of
dams in Washington state and around the country for possible
removal, including, most controversially, four dams on the lower
Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another example that river restoration is on the
national agenda,'' Babbitt said. ``Among the 75,000 (large) dams in
this country, there are a good number which have simply outlived
their purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Condit Dam was ultimately doomed by a combination of biology
and economics. The dam's owner, a publicly-traded Portland-based
utility called PacifiCorp, chose to pay the $17 million cost of
removing the dam rather than come up with the $30 million in
fish-friendly changes that would have been required for the company
to renew its federal license to operate the dam.
</P>
<P>
   The dam generates just 14 megawatts of power _ enough
electricity for about 13,000 homes, but relatively small change in
the world of electrical power. Overall, PacifiCorp generates 8600
megawatts of power, including 1100 from hydropower.
</P>
<P>
   But the 86-year-old dam has had a dramatic impact on the life of
the White Salmon River, a narrow, 45-mile long waterway that rushes
along the border between Kittitas and Skamania counties and empties
into the Columbia River about 60 miles east of Portland. The river
has become popular among white-water rafters and kayakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Condit is the only dam on the river, and blocks access for
migratory fish to about 13 miles of upstream spawning grounds (a
waterfall blocks salmon access farther upstream), as well as to
several White Salmon tributaries such as Spring Creek and
Rattlesnake Creek. Before construction of the dam, some coho,
chinook, steelhead, lamprey and cutthroat trout migrating up the
Columbia would spawn in the White Salmon and its tributaries; those
runs are now at or near extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Two early attempts to construct fish passage around the dam
failed, and the initial owner of the dam, Northwestern Electric,
was allowed to pay for a fish hatchery rather than come up with a
way for wild fish to pass the dam.
</P>
<P>
   The White Salmon now supports only fish spawned in a hatchery
downstream, and the reservoir above the dam is stocked with trout
by state officials and supports a native trout fishery that has
thrived in the absence of competition from larger fish.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are optimistic that as many as 10,000 salmon
would return to the river once the dam is removed, and that
restoration of the fish runs would make the upstream river more
attractive to fish-eating bear, osprey and bald eagles. The
upstream White Salmon remains relatively pristine. The river, which
runs through forests and canyons, is partly federally designated as
a Wild and Scenic River and protected as part of the Columbia River
Gorge National Scenic Area.
</P>
<P>
   The Yakama Nation, which has treaty rights to sites along the
river, will help manage the fishery after dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   PacifiCorps reluctantly signed the agreement to remove the dam,
saying the alternative was costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a company whose business it is to produce low-cost power,
removing a hydropower project isn't something you approach with a
lot of joy, but given the circumstances, we think it was the best
outcome,'' said company spokesman Tom Imeson.
</P>
<P>
   The company was essentially forced to the bargaining table by
federal regulators. In 1996 the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, which licenses dams, ordered the company to construct
costly fish ladders and screens as a condition of renewing its
operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight the requirements in court, the company entered
settlement talks with federal and state agencies, the Yakama
Nation, and environmental groups. Under the deal, signed yesterday
in Portland, the company will be allowed to operate the dam for
seven years and to use the revenue from that operation to pay for
dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from elected officials was supportive, although Rep.
Brian Baird, D-Wash., said he is concerned about the plight of the
people who own summer cabins on the reservoir behind the dam. Those
people are likely to lose their waterfront property when the dam is
removed because the reservoir, which is known as Northwestern Lake,
will narrow into a river.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke praised the parties to the deal,
saying ``The agreement by PacifiCorp, the tribes and
environmentalists to remove the Condit Dam is the kind of
cooperative, results-oriented solution we will need as we work to
restore our wild salmon runs without destroying our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Rebecca Wodder, the president of the environmental
group American Rivers, predicted that more dams will be removed as
the licenses of hydropower dams expire and federal regulators
require prohibitively costly environmental improvements as a
condition of license renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, an enthusiastic supporter of removal of the two dams on
the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, said
he is optimistic that Congress this year will grant the federal
government enough money to purchase them from their private owner,
and that the government can then move toward removal of one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much more controversial proposal by some
environmental groups to remove four dams on the lower Snake River,
Babbitt said the debate is just beginning, while Wodder said that
the agreement on the Condit shows that ``dam removal is a
reasonable option.''

 McCAIN URGES A PARTY SWITCH BY BUCHANAN 
 (rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain denounced Pat Buchanan's views of
World War II on Wednesday and called on the Republican Party to
``stand on principle'' and bid farewell to the conservative
commentator instead of struggling to keep him in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments set him apart from the other Republican
presidential candidates, who have either urged Buchanan not to seek
the Reform Party nomination and risk draining conservative votes
from the eventual Republican nominee or stepped gingerly around the
controversy. And they came at a time when Buchanan's third-party
flirtation is starting to cause a backlash among some of the
Republican Party's conservative intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former prisoner of war who has been making a special
appeal to veterans, singled out Buchanan's views, expressed in a
new book, that Hitler had offered ``no physical threat to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said in a statement released by his
campaign: ``Defeating Hitler's Germany and Tojo's Japan was a very
noble cause, and I wouldn't want any Republican to ever think
otherwise _ or any American for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, McCain had said he welcomed a vigorous foreign
policy debate with Buchanan over issues like global trade and the
U.S. role in trouble spots like Kosovo. But in a telephone
interview Wednesday, McCain said he considered Buchanan's views of
World War II ``so far outside of the philosophy of what America is
all about that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire'' (Regnery
Publishing), Buchanan questioned whether Hitler chose to wage war
with the West or was driven to it by Britain and France's promise
to declare war on Germany if the Nazis invaded Poland. Buchanan
argued that Hitler was interested in eastward expansion and would
have left the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the fears that Buchanan could carry conservatives
out of the Republican Party with him, McCain said, ``I am fully
aware of the political implications of a Buchanan third party
candidacy. But regardless of what the polls show, our party must
stand on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan defended his views Wednesday on CNN, arguing that ``at
least the Western democracies and Western Europe could have been
saved'' if Britain and France had not declared war on Hitler. He
said the Western war guarantee to Poland ``didn't save anybody in
Poland, six million people died in Poland. How could it be worse
for Poland? How could it have been worse than what it was for
European Jews?''
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against Buchanan has begun among some of the
conservative intelligentsia. The editor of ``The Weekly Standard,''
William Kristol, reminded Republicans in the current issue that
Harry S. Truman had not urged Henry Wallace to stay in the
Democratic Party. ``Are Republicans capable of being as courageous
and astute as Harry Truman was half a century ago?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming issue of The National Review, another writer,
Ramesh Ponnuru, argues that Buchanan, because of his views on trade
and foreign policy, ``is in no important sense a conservative any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's effort to push his party to cut Buchanan loose was
not embraced Wednesday by other Republican candidates. Aides to
both Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes, who are fighting for the support
of social conservatives, said the party would be worse off if
Buchanan and his followers leave.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer declined any
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClelland, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, said the
Texas Republican believed that in World War II ``our soldiers were
fighting for freedom.'' But he also reiterated that Bush had spoken
with Buchanan during the Iowa straw poll in August and asked him to
remain a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said the party chairman, Jim Nicholson, still planned to meet with
Buchanan soon to make the case for the Republican Party. ``Our
basic take is that Senator McCain has spoken for himself,'' he
said.

BANK EXECUTIVE ADMITS TO `LAPSE' IN WAKE OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
ACCUSATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: resent to fix byline) 
 
By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bank of New York's top executive acknowledged
Wednesday that ``a lapse'' by the bank enabled Russian businessmen
to funnel several billion dollars through several accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian businesses and individuals, some allegedly linked to
organized crime, are suspected of channeling as much as $10 billion
through the bank, and the FBI and Treasury departments are
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Large volumes of money that moved through the bank over the past
three years drew ``red flags,'' bank president Thomas Renyi told
the House Banking Committee, which is holding hearings on the
allegations. ``But the questions (about the account) were not
pursued with sufficient vigor or follow-through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi mostly defended the bank, emphasizing it has not been
charged with any wrongdoing. ``No relevant authorities have
asserted that the Bank of New York has engaged in money laundering
or violated any other law,'' he said. ``Neither the bank nor any of
its customers have lost any money as a result of the activities in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, who spoke before
Renyi did at the hearing, said he could not comment on the case.
``This has been and will continue to be a complex and painstaking
investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of corruption broke one month ago, after federal
authorities discovered about $4.2 billion was funneled through
several accounts last year. A top executive, Lucy Edwards, helped
set up the accounts for her husband, Peter Berlin, a Russian who
represented himself as a small-businessman working out of New York,
according to Renyi.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have contacted employees involved in the case,
Renyi acknowledged Wednesday, but no charges have been filed. So
far, the firm fired Edwards and suspended one other employee.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal broke, the Bank of New York and government
officials have fashioned new anti-money laundering measures, aimed
to keep better track of foreign businesses and individual bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that money from the International Monetary Fund was
diverted to the Bank of New York has prompted calls for tighter
controls on the way banks do business with foreign correspondents.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday no information has
surfaced that proves IMF funds were moved to the New York Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also told the committee that the United States will urge
withholding international loans from Russia until its leaders
implement more reforms to curb money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the general state of Russian crime, Robinson said
current law has fallen behind the pace and ability of crime
organizations to launder money. One problem is that ``only a very
limited number of foreign offenses are now qualified as specified
unlawful activities,'' he said. Current laws, for example, do not
cover public corruption against foreign governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Thursday will introduce a bill, which
Robinson said would enable federal prosecutors to gain more access
to foreign business records and improve the government's ability to
prosecute banks that knowingly accept criminal money.
</P>
<P>
   Renyi cautioned the government not to overreact to this
particular case. The bank has developed internal programs to thwart
criminal-related transactions, he said. A new Anti-Money Laundering
Committee, for example, reviews unusual account activity and
reports directly to the bank's board of directors. The bank now
works with outside consultants to monitor the flow of funds through
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers craft too strict of laws, Renyi said foreign banks
may ``simply drive would-be wrongdoers to less stringent points of
entry into the system,'' he said. ``Any policy action that would
reduce the importance and attractiveness of the U.S. dollar as the
currency of choice for international trade ... would place the
United States at a competitive disadvantage.''

TECHNOLOGY SHARES LIFT NASDAQ, BUT DOW FALLS 74 POINTS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ High-technology stocks powered the Nasdaq market to a
sizable gain Wednesday, but the Dow was down as investors sorted
through a confusing barrage of information and rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Some expressed fears that the dollar would skid further against
the yen, while others focused on a reassuring economic survey by
the Federal Reserve or on a partial rebound by the Dow Jones
industrial average after it fell to about 10,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern about money leaving our markets and going
abroad,'' said Tim Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston
Advisors, referring to the consequences of the dollar's fall on
foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 10,524.07, a loss of 74.40 points, or 0.7
percent, but that was better than its earlier loss of 104.47
points, to 10,494.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 30 Dow components lost ground, with Union Carbide,
Procter &AMP; Gamble, United Technologies and IBM each down around 2
points.
</P>

   ``We just haven't gone down enough to turn the buyers on,'' said
Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards.

   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fared somewhat better,
eking out a gain of 2.93 points, slightly more than 0.2 percent, to
1,310.51. But much of its strength was in the high-technology
sector. The broader malaise was reflected by a decline by a
majority of index stocks, 255, while 225 rose and 20 were
unchanged.

   Over the longer term, there has been ``an extremely broad-based

UNDERDOGS, AND LOVING IT EVERY MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ So far, Lee Westwood and Colin Montgomerie
are enjoying everything about Ryder Cup week. They are enjoying
their teammates, who seem relaxed and confident. They like The
Country Club, a golf course that will require both skill and
strategy. And most important, Westwood and Montgomerie like
Europe's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice being the underdogs,'' said Westwood, who couldn't
resist taking a small poke at Jeff Maggert, who called the U.S.
team the world's 12 best players on Tuesday. ``There's less
pressure on us and more pressure on them. There's great expectation
for them to win. It's in their own country, so the pressure is
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can beat anybody. I think this format leads to
shocks. They must be under pressure, being the 12 best players in
the world, according to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Europeans can one-putt as frequently as they think of
one-liners, then the United States could be in trouble when the
biennial competition begins on Friday. The Europeans seem to relish
their underdog role, and in the past, they have flourished in it,
winning the 1995 and 1997 Ryder Cups when the United States was
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine Europe's winning this year unless its
two best players, Montgomerie and Westwood, play a huge role. Seven
of Europe's 12 players are Ryder Cup rookies, and those
first-timers will undoubtedly be nervous, especially playing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both Montgomerie and Westwood played the maximum five times in
1997, and that will probably happen again this weekend. That has
been Europe's winning formula in past years: rely heavily on the
top players, with others filling in as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie and Westwood have paced themselves during practice
rounds this week, knowing they will be worked hard once the
competition begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tiring week mentally more than physically,'' said
Montgomerie, who will be playing in his fifth consecutive Ryder
Cup. ``You go out and practice, and there's got to be 30,000 to
40,000 people out there. I just hope if I do play five times, that
I can get as many points as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Montgomerie reacts, not only
to being counted on so heavily, but also to playing another
pressure-laden event in the United States. Montgomerie has been the
dominant player on the European Tour this decade, winning the last
six European money titles, and leading this year's money list
again.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never won a tournament in the United States in 57
attempts, and he has yet to win a major championship, something his
critics point to as a glaring hole in his resume. Montgomerie has
also been distracted at several events in the past by unruly fans
who have heckled him; he is a player who wears his emotions
outwardly.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Europe needs is a moping Montgomerie. But fans
during practice rounds Tuesday and Wednesday were very cordial to
all the Europeans, and Montgomerie said he expected that trend to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Told that he had had problems with American galleries in the
past, Montgomerie smiled and said, ``Have I?'' Then he added: ``I
don't foresee any problems this week. I wholeheartedly enjoy
playing golf in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Montgomerie and Westwood are accurate drivers, which is
crucial at The Country Club. Players who drive the ball well will
be able to attack the small greens and make birdies. Players who
spray the ball off the tee will scramble to make pars and lose
holes.
</P>
<P>
   More responsibility will fall on the shoulders of Montgomerie,
Westwood and Jose Maria Olazabal to lead the Europeans, because
their team has undergone a changing of the guard. Five players who
have been a huge part of Europe's recent teams did not qualify for
this year's event _ Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Seve
Ballesteros and Costantino Rocca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different, no doubt about that,'' Montgomerie
said. ``Those guys were at the top of the tree for a long time, but
that doesn't mean we can't do well without them. What's coming
through in Europe is very, very good. And I'm sure we'll prove that
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that the European captain, Mark James, will pair
Montgomerie with Paul Lawrie in foursome and four-ball events,
while Westwood could be paired with Darren Clarke, his close
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of his playing partner, as Montgomerie goes, so
goes a large part of Europe's team. He played a major role in
Europe's victory in 1997, earning 3.5 points. And he would love to
contribute even more this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players are looking toward Monty, because he's
been the European No. 1, for the past it seems about 35 years
now,'' James said. ``He's our biggest star at the moment. Why
wouldn't I play him five times? I think that's a strong
possibility. As you guys would say, right now, his game is not too
shabby.'' &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ For several years now, their names have
become synonymous with big-time golf as it heads into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   You know them as Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard. As Jim Furyk
and Phil Mickelson. As Jeff Maggert and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   You might also know them as the oh-for-Ryder six-pack.
</P>
<P>
   Tack on 41-year-old Hal Sutton and 40-year-old Tom Lehman _
Sutton was part of two U.S. losses more than a decade ago when he
was a precursor to the current frat-pack of flashy phenoms, and
Lehman has proved that failure in the Ryder Cup is a taste late
bloomers can acquire _ and you have eight members of the 1999 U.S.
team who are hoping to take their first sip of success from the
Ryder Cup this week at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   That's two-thirds of the U.S. team that has never played for a
winning Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   For Duval, there's an excuse. He's playing in his first Ryder
Cup. He's innocent until proved guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, Leonard and Furyk were on the losing 1997 team in
Valderrama, Spain. And Maggert, Mickelson and Lehman were members
of the '95 and '97 teams that lost to the Europeans. As for Sutton,
he hasn't been to this party since 1987, but those teams he was on
in the mid-'80s were the first to lose the Cup since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is an American team that needs to break through
some barriers, even if it will be heavily favored when the
competition begins Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the team in '97, I know how important it was to
(captain) Tom Kite to try to win it back and then to know the
disappointment,'' says Leonard. ``I don't feel like we've taken on
any extra burden. But I think for guys like Jeff and I who haven't
been on a winning team, we want to make Ben's (captain Ben
Crenshaw's) hard work pay off. We want to be able to enjoy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had that (losing) taste in our mouth before. And we'd
like to try something else.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, it's a blow to the Americans' confidence, not
to mention their ego, that the players who are supposed to be the
cornerstone of professional golf into the next era have been so
stunningly bad in Ryder competition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 at Valderrama, where the Europeans built a huge early
lead and then coasted to the win, the threesome of Davis Love III,
Woods and Leonard posted a combined 1-9-3 match record. They were
the toothpick-strong backbone of the U.S. collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Love has been in four Ryder Cups and been involved with one
victorious team.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the need for the younger generation of U.S. golfing
stars to get off the goose egg that has put so much pressure on
them going into this year's Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there's a very strong sense of urgency for this
team to win,'' Lehman says. ``I think we need to win. That's all
there is to it. And I fully expect us to play our best golf, and I
expect us to win, as I'm sure the Europeans expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have full and complete confidence in the other 11 guys on
this team and myself. I think it's a must-win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just to validate the youngsters on the PGA Tour. Lehman
and Maggert share a common thread with Crenshaw in that they know
how much preparation goes into the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me being on the last two Ryder Cups and not winning, as a
player, it was easy for me to put that behind me,'' Maggert says.
``But the things that I remember is Lanny (Wadkins) and Tom Kite. I
really felt for those guys because they worked their tails off for
two years. And I felt bad for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win this thing for myself. But I want to do it for
Ben and Julie (his wife) because I know how hard they worked the
past two years and it means a lot for them if we win. And it means
a lot to me, too. But from the last two Ryder Cups, I really felt
for the captains because I know how much they wanted to win the
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great teams in '95 and '97, and we all know what the
results were then. I feel like we have a really strong team. But
golf is a funny game at times. And anything can happen. I think
everybody on the team is in a good frame of mind. But as far as
being overconfident, I don't think anyone's taking this thing for
granted, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the result of recent years, one would expect not.
</P>
<P>
   But if getting pummeled two times in a row does anything to a
team, it tests its pride. The Americans know now what they may not
have wanted to admit in the past _ that Europe's players and team
concept, along with their mastery of the Ryder Cup formats, make
them a worthy foe every time this match is contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on two losing teams while being expected to win
pretty handily, and it's been certainly disappointing to experience
that,'' says Mickelson, who has seen his wonderful 4-1-2 match
record wasted in the last two Cups. ``I think in the past we may
have felt like they were going to give it to us. And we saw through
the play of the European side and the putts they made and shots
they hit that they beat us pretty soundly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we're going to expect to win this year, we're going to
have to play extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw has tried to do his best to defuse talk that the
pressure is squarely on the Americans. But he admits that many
members of his team need to fill a void in their professional
careers, and there's only one way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would certainly love to complete a career that way,''
Crenshaw says of being a member of a winning Ryder Cup team. ``Many
of the Ryder Cup participants on the American side are at the
veteran stage of their career. So I think they're very intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the last couple of matches, we do have some
younger players that have not been successful in the Ryder Cup. And
I think that they dwell on that. But I certainly think that in an
overall view, both sides, if you've done a lot of wonderful things
in your career and you don't tack on a Ryder Cup victory, you feel
a little bit lacking, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   And Crenshaw is quietly optimistic that his team recognizes what
must be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly important for us,'' he says. ``I think everyone
knows that for our side, not having had success in the last few
occasions. And the players have asked themselves over a long while
about what sort of effort they were going to put forth. It's
wonderful seeing that come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing that says heartbreak isn't waiting
again for the Americans this week at The Country Club. The
Europeans exude a sort of confidence that belies the fact that they
have seven players who will be playing in the Ryder Cup for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   As captain Mark James says, searching for the reasons why Europe
has been better in the past two Ryder Cups is a matter of looking
at the situation honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very easy, if you lose a match once, to blame it on
not being hungry or having a bad captain or the players not being
team-oriented,'' James says. ``But you're looking for excuses, I
think. It comes down to how they play. I think sometimes the role
of the captain and team spirit can be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look for excuses, you're hiding the fact that
maybe one team played slightly better.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the Americans must do to get off the schneid this
week.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia's leading tycoons,
founded a bank last year out of the ruins of the nation's economy,
some Western banks decided to keep their distance. They did not
want the new bank as a client until Potanin settled with creditors
at his old insolvent one, Uneximbank.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank of New York was one of a number of banks that did
pick up the account, displaying an aggressiveness that has made it
the leading American bank in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Bank of New York has emerged as the undisputed leader in providing
an essential behind-the-scenes payment service linking Russia's
economy with the West. It is a high-volume business in which
thousands of international transactions are handled in a sequence
of payments involving Russian and foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the FBI examines the bank's records for possible money
laundering, specialists question whether the huge flow of money _
nearly $4 billion a day _ made the bank less vigilant than it
should have been about the background of its customers and the
sources of their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned into a huge supermarket,'' said Andrei
Melnichenko, the director of MDM Bank, which was a Bank of New York
customer until he had a dispute with the bank. ``If you have many
clients and you want to have good relations, you don't have time
enough to control all of it and there is a risk of error.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in hearings in Washington on Wednesday, Thomas A. Renyi,
chairman of the bank, said it had failed to pursue questions about
the billions of dollars flowing through accounts that had been
opened by the husband of a bank officer.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has brought allegations of surreptitious
capital flight and possible money laundering. But it has also
thrown a spotlight on the hazards and rewards of banking in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank of New York went to places other foreign banks had
not been before and provided good service,'' said Richard
Hainsworth, the Moscow representative of Thomson Financial
Bankwatch, a rating agency. ``But the Bank of New York's
flexibility and aggressive marketing also later led it to work with
clients that other banks ostracized.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a risk that confronts any foreign institution determined
to do business in the twilight world of the Russian economy, where
companies often circumvent the rules, and corrupt officials are all
too common.
</P>
<P>
   No one has charged the bank with any wrongdoing. But since the
investigation surfaced last month, several Russian bankers say,
they have taken some business to other foreign banks simply to
avoid being linked to the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Bank of New York has declined to comment. But on
Wednesday, Renyi said the bank was reviewing whether to continue
its business with Russian banks.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has performed an important function in the Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Russia's trade revolves around the dollar, and many
foreign companies want to be paid in dollars by their Russian
customers. To serve their clients, Russian banks need what is
called a dollar settlement account with a powerful Western bank
that can transfer dollars from one account to another quickly and
safely. But these accounts can also be used to spirit money to
offshore banking havens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the banks were set up by a couple of guys who wanted to
get money out of the country,'' a former Western banker in Moscow
said about Russian banks. ``You'd go there and some 22-year-old who
spoke English and had just finished a degree in finance would be
the chairman. People tried to explain it by saying it was a new
economy _ but come on!''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out which clients operate in the gray areas of the
economy is difficult. ``People felt that Russian banks were
responsible for checking their clients' pasts,'' the former Western
banker said.
</P>
<P>
   And since the fees for processing each transaction are small _
American banks generally charge $2 and $4 a transaction _ the goal
was to line up as many clients as possible. ``It is
volume-driven,'' said Margot K. Jacobs, an analyst for United
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of dollars in fees and relatively little risk, the
Bank of New York had plenty of competitors, including Republic
National, Citibank and Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank of New York led the business because it offered
some practical advantages. First, it had worldwide experience. It
also had a popular staff of Russian-speaking bankers: Vladimir
Galitzine, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky and her assistant, Lucy
Edwards. They understood the society and were on a first-name basis
with the players.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a reputation for expert service. Ms. Kagalovsky,
who eventually assumed responsibility for the bank's Eastern
European division, was widely consulted by Russian bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely friendly,'' said one former Western banker
in Russia. ``You'd go into a party and there would be eight Russian
bankers around her because to them she was the No. 1 banker for
Russia's interests in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no data available that establishes a clear link between
the success of the bank's settlement business in Moscow and the
money that flowed through bank accounts in London and New York that
are under investigation. What is clear is that the Bank of New York
led the field, with clients that included major Russian banks like
Inkombank, Menatep and Sberbank, which is owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri V. Ponamarev, the head of the Russian Trading System,
which is used by brokerage houses to buy and sell stocks over the
counter, said his organization chose the Bank of New York for the
reasons many others did: It was the leader and it kept customers
happy. ``There were no complications,'' Ponamarev said. ``Everybody
used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial collapse in August 1998 and the allegations
of money laundering swirling around the Bank of New York have had a
sobering effect on many banks here.
</P>
<P>
   Murad M. Megali, managing director of Chase Manhattan Bank
International, who oversees the bank's business in Russia and other
former Soviet republics, declined to comment specifically on the
Bank of New York. But he noted the problems in doing business here:
``Eighty percent of the battle is won or lost at the gate. If you
let in wrong clients, you set yourself up for a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan, he said, tried carefully to check the banks it
did business with and rejected a significant number, particularly
after the 1998 crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also bankers who say some critics of Bank of New
York were simply less successful at correspondent services and in
fact dealt with many of the same clients in other areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the Bank of New York's decision to accept Potanin's new
bank as a customer illustrates how complex it is to build a
business in Russia: As Potanin established the new bank, Rosbank,
the creditors for his old bank, Uneximbank, were still demanding to
be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that Rosbank had been set up with the
remaining assets of the bankrupt Uneximbank, an accusation that a
spokesman for Rosbank denied. Others questioned whether it was
ethical to do business with a new bank if it was controlled by
people whose old bank had just collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   American Express Bank decided against setting up a correspondent
account for Rosbank. Chase Manhattan also made it clear it was not
willing to set up such an account.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York and Republic National Bank, however, agreed
to set up accounts, as did Credit Suisse First Boston and other
European and Asian banks. A spokesman for Rosbank said the bank now
had correspondent accounts at 53 banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to do business in Russia and be lily white,'' said
Hainsworth, of the Thomson bank rating agency. &QL;

TRUTH IS, `LIAR' TAKES THE COWARD'S WAY OUT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The tradition of short stories in which deception and pain
devastate the life of the protagonist can be found in the novel
``Jakob the Liar'' by Jurek Becker (Penguin, $11.95). But if you're
looking for similar complexity in the film adaptation starring
Robin Williams at his dampest and neediest, you'd be advised to
give the book another shot. Williams is Jakob, detained in a
Nazi-occupied ghetto with thousands of other Jews. While waiting
for humiliation at the hands of a Nazi, Jakob happens to overhear
on the Nazis' radio a piece of news that is so powerful even the
Nazi propaganda machine can't put too good a face on it: Russian
forces are threatening to overrun the Germans at the Polish border,
not too far from the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The news is too much for Jakob. He leaks it to a slow-witted but
well-meaning boxer friend (Liev Schreiber), who not only blabs
about the possibility of Soviet saviors but also says that Jakob
has a secret radio. This misinformation gives a cast including
Armin Mueller-Stahl, Alan Arkin and, most embarrassingly, Bob
Balaban a chance to compete for the most eye-moistening attention.
Coming after the stylized approach of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which
dealt with the Holocaust in similar terms, ``Jakob'' has almost no
chance of gaining an audience. For the material to work, the movie
would have to be a lot more daring in its mix of bleak humor and
hopelessness, focusing on a narrator and central figure who is
essentially unreliable. (His unreliability is the point of the
story.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob'' is too intent on winning us over to gamble on such a
stratagem. Its timidity, flinching from a great subject, results in
an ending determined to make audiences leave the theater feeling
uplifted. Maybe the Robin Williams who starred in ``The World
According to Garp'' would've been up for starring in a film about
finding slivers of hope only to have them dashed before your eyes,
or for playing a man who was untrustworthy instead of someone
ennobled by torment. Nowadays, he might have forced a happy ending
even on ``Garp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' is rated PG-13 for adult subject matter,
violence and mild sexuality. .MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

U.S. EMPLOYING 2 STRATEGIES IN LAWSUIT AGAINST CIGARETTE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Fla., Texas, Calif., Ind.)  (With TOBACCO-SUIT) 
(lh) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed against cigarette makers Wednesday by the
government has two legal strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In one thrust, the government will try to recover money it says
it spent on treating smoking-related illnesses of the elderly,
military personnel and federal employees by relying on federal
statutes that legal experts describe as obscure and rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second strategy, the Justice Department portrays
cigarette makers as racketeers who should be forced to disgorge
ill-gotten profits, saying they conspired for decades to mislead
the public about the health risks of smoking and the addictiveness
of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts said the suit faced stiff legal challenges
from tobacco makers and could take years to reach trial. But in the
meantime, they said, it puts tobacco producers back into the
position they sought to avoid by agreeing to pay states $248
billion to settle their smoking-related suits _ that of renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry wants the cultural understanding of smoking to be
one where it is OK for adults to smoke and not OK for children to
smoke,'' said Stephen Sugarman, a professor of law at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``They do not want it to be
one where the cigarette is considered evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Little, a lawyer for Philip Morris Cos., the nation's
largest cigarette maker, said that the federal lawsuit did not
contain any surprises and that he expected it to be dismissed
quickly in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no basis in law,'' Little said. ``It has no basis in
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the legal uncertainties surrounding the federal
lawsuit are like those that accompanied the states' suits, the
first of which was filed in 1994 by Mississippi. A state had never
previously sought to recover money from cigarette makers, so their
lawyers had to devise new theories or adopt old ones to a new
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The states, which sued to recover money spent treating
low-income patients through the Medicaid program, used a variety of
approaches including claims under their state consumer protection
or fraud laws. For their part, government lawyers, who are seeking
to recoup Medicare and other outlays, are also relying on laws
never tested before against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the federal Medical Care Recovery Act, which was
passed in 1962 to enable the government to recover money spent
treating military personnel, American Indians and others injured by
products or in accidents. Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford
University, said the law was amended in 1996 to permit the
government to recover money spent treating Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rabin said, typically only individual claims were
brought under the Act, so one major hurdle that the government
faces is whether a court will allow it to bring together millions
of individual claims in a single action against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Feds can't aggregate claims, the statute is of no
benefit to them,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also marks the first time that federal officials have
used the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
against an entire industry. The so-called RICO statute was
initially passed to fight organized crime, though it has been used
against businesses accused of conspiring together to cheat the
public or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Florida and Texas used Rico counts in their lawsuits
against cigarette makers. But G. Robert Blakey, a law professor at
Notre Dame University who worked with state officials in Florida
and Texas, said Justice Department officials were initially
skeptical when he proposed a similar strategy to them in January.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering claim, however, could prove the government's
most powerful legal weapon against cigarette makers, some lawyers
believe. To prove such a claim, the government must show that
cigarette makers engaged in an pattern of activity intended to play
down the risks of smoking and the addictiveness of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, producers would be forced to disgorge past
profits as ill- gotten gains and potentially pay treble damages.
</P>
<P>
   Little, the Philip Morris lawyer, said the government's
racketeering claim was legally unfounded. But Joseph DiGenova, a
lawyer in Washington, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, this is an unprecedented use of the
statute, and it may be a legitimate one,'' DiGenova said. ``It all
depends on what the evidence is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a judge or jury will ever hear that evidence is anyone's
question. All of the state lawsuits were settled prior to verdict,
and as a result there are not legal precedents for the government's
case. In addition, with huge financial stakes at issue, there is
always the potential for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to get federal regulation over the
cigarette industry, a concession that the states failed to achieve
in their settlements. But election politics could cloud settlement
prospects as the tobacco industry awaits the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mary Aronson, a tobacco industry analyst in Washington,
said she believed the selection of a favorable judge in the federal
case could be a spur to settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might provide a certain type of leverage for settlement,''
Ms. Aronson said.

CHINA JOINS OTHERS TO REJECT PLEAS THAT THE U.N. HALT CIVIL WARS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call for more
active intervention by the United Nations when civilian populations
are at risk is meeting resistance in the General Assembly.
Wednesday China joined a small but vocal group of nations objecting
to an idea that has become the theme of this year's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such arguments as `human rights taking precedence over
sovereignty' and `humanitarian intervention' seem to be in vogue
these days,'' China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said in a
speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for national sovereignty and noninterference in another
country's affairs, he said, are ``the basic principles governing
international relations,'' and any deviation would lead to a new
form of gunboat diplomacy that would ``wreak havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his address to the General Assembly on
Tuesday, also called on the members of the United Nations to
prepare for more interventions.
</P>
<P>
   India came under attack from Pakistan's foreign minister, Sartaj
Aziz, for military abuses against Kashmiris, and India warned that
nations' sovereignty should not be diminished by international
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an error,'' said Jaswant Singh, the Indian foreign
minister, ``to assume that the days of the state are over. The
state continues to have a crucial role and relevance _ also,
therefore, national sovereignties.''
</P>
<P>
   Like India, China has long been sensitive to pressures on human
rights, especially in Tibet, and has spoken before on the
inviolability of borders and the sanctity of political cultures.
But this year China used the example of Kosovo to drive its point
home in unambiguous terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outbreak of war in Kosovo has sounded an alarm for us
all,'' Tang said. ``A regional military organization, in the name
of humanitarianism and human rights, bypassed the United Nations
and took military action against a sovereign state. It created an
ominous precedent in international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia this spring to put an end to Serbs'
attacks on Kosovo's Albanian population has been mentioned by many
speakers, making Kosovo a code word for the kind of action that a
significant number of speakers have been advocating, though most
say these military campaigns must be authorized by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the Kosovo conflict represents a turning
point,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany.
``However, the Kosovo conflict also marks a change of direction in
the development of international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer offered a proposal to help avoid the kind of situation
that led to NATO's acting outside the U.N. system in Kosovo because
of the threat of a Chinese or Russian veto in the Security Council:
He recommended that the nations with veto power _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ be required to explain any
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the U.N. Charter, the Security Council acts with
the mandate and on behalf of all U.N. member states,'' Fischer
said. ``But hitherto they have not been entitled to learn why a
state has exercised its right of veto. This is neither democratic
nor transparent, but also makes it easier for states to veto a
resolution for national rather than international interests. The
introduction of an obligation for a state to explain to the General
Assembly why it is vetoing a resolution would make it more
difficult to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nations would go further and abolish the veto, which all
permanent members of the Council solidly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, said that military
action is now being used ``to deal with tragedies that only a few
years ago would have left us indifferent,'' and that such a change
requires rules based on universal principles of human rights.
These, however, have often been difficult to define at the United
Nations.

<P>
   PULI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese by the thousands kept threading across
half-ruptured bridges here Thursday, past fresh rockslides and
across miles of rippled asphalt to search for relatives at the
epicenter of the Taiwan earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With rescue efforts complicated by Wednesday's aftershocks, they
are finding that nature had dealt capriciously with this mountain
town of 89,000 people closest to the quake's ground zero. Here and
elsewhere in Taiwan's hardest-hit Nantou County it looked as if the
quake had hopscotched across the landscape like a giant tornado,
devastating one place while leaving adjacent territory seemingly
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what seemed just as remarkable was that anyone could have
survived the epicenter's fury Tuesday, and then three jolting
aftershocks measuring 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0 _ the strongest of more than
2,000 that have rocked the island _ on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks were feared to have triggered mudslides, cracked
one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs and forced evacuations, as the
death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,043 people, the
Interior Ministry's disaster mnanagement center said Thursday.
There were estimates that more than 6,537 were injured and 100,000
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, relatives and rescue workers here in
Puli had pulled out 180 dead bodies from the wreckage of more than
1,000 squashed buildings. Another 1,020 people have turned up
injured, and the scent of decaying bodies indicates that at least
some others remain in the wreckage of buildings that seemed to have
collapsed to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the people remaining under the rubble are all
dead,'' Mayor Hung Ming Chang told reporters about 40 hours after
Monday's quake that measured 7.6 on the open-ended Richter scale.
The mayor estimated that one-fourth of his town had been totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on this island of 22 million, rescue efforts yielded
just nine people pulled alive from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Much-needed rescue crews from Fairfax Co., Va., and Miami-Dade,
Fla., arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and rescued a man who had been
trapped 48 hours inside a caved-in apartment building in the town
of Touliu.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my building?'' 33-year-old survivor Hsu
Tse-kai asked repeatedly, according to the Associated Press, as the
crews spent eight hours digging him out of a four-story chunk of
building that had been compressed into about 10 feet of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue workers then started digging deeper in search of a
1-year-old boy, saying they were encouraged by listening devices
that appeared to pick up the sound of a child's toy, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 countries have sent earthquake specialists to the
island, including the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey,
Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Central News Agency placed the number of foreign specialists
in the country at about 500, with more scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Puli, at least, the fast-moving relief effort seemed
markedly more effective than the near-paralysis that beset Turkish
agencies when a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck central Turkey in
August, killing more than 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And by whatever quirk of the way nature's tectonic plates
collided in the belly of the earth, many of Puli's inhabitants
lived to tell about it. And although most buildings suffered cracks
in interior walls, most looked relatively undamaged from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Puli, desperate relatives had to drive their cars or
motorcycles across a dozen precarious bridges whose pavement had
sunk or collapsed. Some were passable only because workers laid
down patches that looked like steel band-aids across gaps in the
joints of bridge sections.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was a journey to grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is still buried there in the first floor,'' said Luo
Jian Zhe, a 33-year-old salesman, clutching an incense stick as he
watched Japanese and Taiwanese rescue crews drilling into his
prosperous in-laws' collapsed four-story home. Luo watched rescuers
haul out the corpses of
</P>
<P>
   four of his in-laws, only to learn that his sister, too, had
been found crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   For others like semiconductor engineer Child Lee(CQ), joy was at
the other end of the perilous ascent from western Taiwan's
relatively untouched coastal flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't know what was going on here because we couldn't
connect by telephone,'' said Lee, 33, ``so we had to come up here
somehow to see.'' Lee found that his sister's father-in-law, a
retired bank executive, had survived unhurt and with most of his
possessions intact within a few miles of the epicenter of one of
Taiwan's deadliest quakes since a 7.4 magnitude tremor hit the
island in 1935, killing 3,276 people. Taiwan is hit by dozens of
quakes each year, but most are centered in the Pacific Ocean east
of the island and cause no damage.
</P>
<P>
   The ravaging of this Puli alone, accounted for nearly one-tenth
of the deaths due to the earthquake throughout Taiwan, and
one-fourth of the island's earthquake injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With Puli emerging on Taiwanese television reports as the center
of devastation, the high command of the Taiwanese Army flew and
trucked in hundreds of soldiers to mount a formidable
military-style relief effort for Puli and surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat this calamity like a war,'' said Maj. Gen. Wu Se Hui,
one of a procession of senior commanders who have been arriving
aboard helicopter relief flights to supervise local aid efforts.
``Once the order comes down from the top, we can move very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 24-hour period, the Taiwanese Army landed more than 60
helicopter loads of food, bottled water, tents, frozen blood and
other supplies in Puli's makeshift rescue center in an athletic
field behind an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   With the morgues and hospitals in Puli overflowing with scores
of corpses, the Army began flying in blocks of ice and body bags to
prevent the victims from decomposing before they could be examined
by forensic investigators and then buried.

   NEW YORK _ In a fall windows at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship
Manhattan store, a certain fashion dissonance was on display.
</P>
<P>
   The background suggested a genteel Tuscany picnic _ replete with
baskets of grapes, Chianti Ruffino in a straw bottle holder and
denuded tree branches. It was a setting that the store's most loyal
customer, a well-kept woman in her late 40s, might know well.
</P>
<P>
   But the clothes seemed cut for another silhouette completely _
maybe a 20-something actress attending a post-movie-premiere party
at the downtown nightclub Moomba. In one window, a mannequin posed
noncommittally in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana hot magenta floral hip huggers
and electric-orange leopard print pin-point heel pumps. In another,
the mannequin lounged in a vinyl camisole with a 3-D print secured
with Velcro straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd that look on me, John,'' joked a well-dressed tourist to
her husband as the two ogled the display in early September. ``I
could wear it to the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Saks Fifth Avenue, the venerable clothier to the
ladies who lunch, turned 75, but a placid old age is not in the
cards. Even with America in the midst of a consumer spending boom,
Saks Fifth Avenue _ along with Neiman Marcus, the other luxury
department store chain _ is struggling to make the kind of profits
Wall Street demands of retailers these days.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to high-fashion success has always been finding the
right balance between nurturing cutting-edge design and stocking
enough money-making name brands to satisfy traditional customers.
But for Saks today, under new and very bottom-line-oriented
management, that balancing act has turned particularly precarious.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Saks Holdings Inc. _ the store's owner _ was bought
by Proffitt's, a fast-growing Southern retailer. And R. Brad
Martin, the chief executive of Proffitt's _ since renamed Saks Inc.
_ had lofty expectations for his catch. He had made his company an
investor darling by gobbling up regional department store chains
like McRae's, Younkers and Carson Pirie Scott, and then squeezing
out big savings by consolidating mundane back-office functions like
real estate and ordering office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But with earnings slumping, Martin ``does not have unlimited
patience,'' said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst with A.G.
Edwards, who met with him recently. ``He is not going to stand by
if the performance continues to lag _ he will make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, Martin had predicted 6 percent
growth in sales and nearly 35 percent growth in earnings. To
investors worried that Saks Fifth Avenue, with its high
concentration of couture brands like Bill Blass and Yves Saint
Laurent, would not mesh well with the rest of his empire, Martin
scoffed. All fashion decisions at the chain would continue to be
made by its impeccably groomed longtime chairman and chief
executive, Philip B. Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-August, Saks Inc., which is based in Birmingham,
Ala., rocked Wall Street by lowering its earnings estimates for the
year to $1.80 a share from $2.10. During calls with analysts,
Martin admitted that roughly 8 cents, or nearly one-third of the
shortfall, could be traced to lower margins from Saks Fifth Avenue,
which now accounts for about 40 percent of Saks Inc.'s revenue.
Analysts and investors responded by pounding the stock, which in
February went as high as $39.50, sending it to a new low of $17,
where it has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Did performance really suffer, or did Martin expect too much?
Miller's blue eyes flashed with anger at the suggestion that Saks
Fifth Avenue had lost its way. Ensconced in his paisley
wall-papered office, Miller insisted that sales growth was above
that of the rest of Saks Inc., which will be about 4 percent for
the year, and that he beat out other luxury merchants, notably
Neiman Marcus, as well. ``We have taken real market share from the
competition,'' Miller said. ``We may not have met expectations, but
we certainly did not embarrass ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, designers who sell to the company, as well as analysts
who cover it _ many of whom have had heart-to-wallet conversations
with Martin recently _ see real trouble in the gap between Martin's
expectations and the chain's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem seems to be that there was a general
softening in the luxury market over the summer. While plenty of the
highest-end merchants, like Gucci and Tiffany, have reported strong
sales recently, Neiman Marcus Group Inc., Saks Fifth Avenue's most
direct competitor, posted disastrous results last month. With
anemic sales growth of less than 1 percent forcing Neiman Marcus to
make steep markdowns, profits plunged 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Saks also faces the matter of getting the right merchandise
mix. Some of this might be easily remedied. For example, analysts
say Saks Fifth Avenue is still heavy on formal business clothing,
particularly expensive men's suits like Hugo Boss and Brioni, while
much of America has long since moved to casual workplace attire.
Also, Saks Fifth Avenue's private-label clothing _ which Martin is
counting on to lift profits in the future _ is still too expensive
for its quality. Fine-gauge white men's T-shirts that might be a
buy at $40 instead go for $78.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious is the assertion by Wall Street that Saks Fifth
Avenue cannot manage its high-end designer fashions. ``In an effort
to have a compelling assortment, things got away from them,'' and
they went too far with riskier designs that did not sell, said
Christine Kilton-Augustine, a retail and apparel analyst with ING
Baring.
</P>
<P>
   High-end designer apparel accounts for 15 percent of Saks Fifth
Avenue's revenue and probably only about 6 percent or 7 percent of
its profits, but it sets the tone for the entire store.
</P>
<P>
   Established couture and career lines from Chanel, Max Mara and
Prada have a devoted following at Saks. But while these big brands
bring in a steady flow of revenue, that money comes with a lot of
strings attached. Many of those brands have developed their own
stores, which compete for business. Some do not allow Saks Fifth
Avenue to display the entire collection, and many make demands
about merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Edgy styles from emerging designers like Alexander McQueen and
Issey Miyake take up less space, but have the potential to play a
more important role, attracting younger, more adventurous women.
These customers may spend less on clothes but will purchase
cosmetics, like the $75 lipsticks offered by the Saks house brand
By Terry, or spend $150 for a faux diamond choker.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting such brands when they are still relatively
unknown, Saks also gambles on a richer payoff if they suddenly
become popular. They are hoping for the next Dolce &AMP; Gabbana _
``the next big hit before it gets too big,'' explains Ike Lagnado
of Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that small designers take a lot of effort, and
money, to nurture, and they have unpredictable sales. Unlike the
big brands, lesser-known names offer stores nothing in the way of
support _ like advertising dollars or money back if sales fail to
materialize _ so a bad season for enough small designers can have a
serious impact on the bottom line. Analysts say that is exactly
what happened at Saks Fifth Avenue this past year _ and that the
new owners may not have the stomach for it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for an outsider to discern to what extent emerging
designers are in trouble at Saks Fifth Avenue _ everyone from the
store to the designers, who have few other places to sell their
goods, has a stake in painting a rosy picture _ but some troubling
issues have emerged. Ellen Carey, who represents the Australian
designer Collette Dinnigan in the United States, has only praise
for Saks Fifth Avenue, which has put Ms. Dinnigan's designs in 12
stores. Miller has been tremendously supportive of the brand, she
said, but added that the chain cannot give designers the intensely
hands-on maintenance that a much smaller specialty store like
Barney's offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saks has sophisticated owners and sophisticated shoppers, but
the sales staff needs to be brought up to par,'' Ms. Carey said.
She said Ms. Dinnigan has managed to sell roughly 60 percent of her
collection at full price each season because she ships her entire
collection at once, so that it is obvious how to display it. Other
designers sometimes ship trousers one week and blouses another,
leaving it to the store staff to assemble outfits for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several designer representatives, who insisted on anonymity,
were even more worried. They fault Saks Fifth Avenue not for lack
of trying, but for being part of a discouraging cycle in luxury.
For years mid-level, or ``bridge,'' designer wear has been
suffering because department stores, pressured to compete with
discount and specialty stores, have been marking down such goods
steeply. Now the same cycle is happening to luxury, which had
previously been immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mark down very early, and don't give the merchandise the
time to perform,'' one designer representative complained. ``Last
fall, our winter goods hit the floor in October, and by November
they were on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, on an early September afternoon, the markdown racks
were overflowing. An Armani denim jacket had been slashed from
$1,245 to $372, and a Chloe basket-weave skirt in royal blue was
going for $600 off its list price of $1,050.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Martin insists that he has no intention of meddling in
Saks Fifth Avenue's designer business and that he has full
confidence in the chain's luxury strategy. ``I believe absolutely
that this economic model can be profitable,'' he said. ``Designer
is at the heart of who we are and a key element of our future
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Martin has already made back-office changes at Saks
Inc. that could hurt the chain's ability to attract luxury
customers. For example, he has cut its renovation budget by 20
percent _ a Saks spokesperson said that the savings all came from
efficiency moves, not cuts in projects _ and forced the retailer to
reduce inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Designers lament that they have already felt the impact of the
merger and Saks Inc.'s overriding concern with profitability. Many
say they are being forced to reach sales goals for full-price
merchandise that would be difficult for one speciality store, let
alone for a 59-store chain.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin made no apologies for his determined approach. ``We
expect an extraordinary return on capital invested,'' he said,
``and Saks Fifth Avenue's portfolio will give us that return.''

   CHINA-REPUBLIC-CELEBRATION (Shanghai, China) _ The 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China is being heralded
here with a celebration intended by the government to top all
celebrations. On Friday morning, half a million invited citizens
will gather in Tiananmen Square in Beijing for a speech by
President Jiang Zemin, followed by the biggest military parade in
the country's history, with 90 floats, 140,000 marchers, numerous
tanks and weapons, and 130 sorties by Chinese Air Force planes. At
dusk, 100,000 dancers and singers will perform. When darkness
finally falls, fireworks displays with names like ``Chanting the
Eulogy of the Motherland'' will burst forth simultaneously from 10
locations around the capital. By Sheila Melvin. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

   TORONTO-FILM-FEST (subslug) (Toronto) _ The ten-day Toronto
International Film Festival ended its 24th incarnation last Sunday
after hosting more than 300 films, dozens of major stars and
filmmakers and hundreds of journalists and industry types from all
over the world. Slightly bleary from a day's worth of questions
about ``Sunshine'' _ a Hungarian generational epic from director
Istvan Szabo in which Ralph Fiennes plays three roles _ the actor
was collecting his thoughts after the last of the journalists had
left and was preparing to make a 36-hour escape before he had to
return for yet another push, this time for ``Onegin,'' an
adaptation of Pushkin's narrative poem directed by Martha Fiennes,
his sister. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).

   GAY-AIDS-FILMS (Undated) _ The Association of Lesbian and Gay
Pride Films, an activist group in France, has produced a series of
10 short films geared to the gay and lesbian population in the
context of AIDS. The films titled ``L'Amour Est a Reinventor''
(``Love Reinvented'') were released in France in 1998 and will open

That's a rather broad esthetic philosophy, but it sits well with
the husky, garrulous man whose latest larger-than-life set
surrounds the action of ``Epic Proportions,'' a new comedy opening
Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater. By Steven Drukman. (Moved).

<P>
   EVE-ENSLER-THEATER (New York) _ If you'd never seen Eve Ensler's
one-woman show ``The Vagina Monologues'' and if you knew she had
also written plays about Bosnian refugees, women in prison and
nuclear war, you might expect her to be humorless, single-minded,
even didactic. But to step into Ms. Ensler's apartment in Chelsea
is to confront a positively bubbly figure. Ms. Ensler, 46, good
humor masks a serious purpose and a troubled personal history that
gave rise to ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which began its second New
York run last Tuesday (in previews at the Westside Theater). The
monologues are part of Ms. Ensler's crusade to wipe out the shame
and embarrassment that many women still associate with their bodies
or their sexuality. By Dinitia Smith. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UPSIDE-DOWN-DANCE (New York) _ To the propulsive beat of the
Nigerian composer Fela Anikulapo Kuti's music, the choreographer
Ronald K. Brown led his 12 sinuous dancers across the floor in
fast, rhythmic movements, each stride increasing the tension in the
studio. Just five minutes into ``Upside Down,'' Brown had already
reached a wrenchingly emotional place. It is a place he fruitfully
visits often. ``Upside Down,'' a section from a larger work, the
1998 ``Destiny,'' illustrates the enormous effort and energy it
takes to move toward inner peace in a chaotic world. When Brown's
aptly named company, Evidence, begins its one-week engagement at
the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, it will present ``Upside Down'' as
well as two other Brown works; Ebony Magazine'' and ``Water.'' By

<P>
   BROOKLYN-PHILHARMONIC (New York) _ For their season that opens
on Friday, Robert Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic have put
together a set of programs to survey the 20th century at its end.
This is a 20th-century season in two ways: not only does all the
music come from the last hundred years, but the planning has a very
20th-century feel. Spano and his orchestra are concerned less with
great composers than with great themes _ war, politics, pop
culture, the environment, faith _ and there is no attempt to make
sure that all the outstanding creative personalities will be
represented. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA-PHILHARMONIC (Seewalchen Amattersee, Austria) _ Yes, 1999
is a Johann Strauss year, filled with commemorations of the
composer's death 100 years ago. And yes, it ends in the turning not
only of the century but also of the millennium. Yet when the Vienna
Philharmonic performs Strauss waltzes on New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day in the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna and on worldwide
television, it will be conducting business more or less as usual.

   CHRIS-GAINES-ALBUM (Undated) _ Whether it is a testament to
cowardice, marketing or megalomania, ``Chris Gaines'' is a gutsy
undertaking, not only as an attempt by an outsider to fit into
another genre but also as a greatest hits album that tries to fit
into each phase of that genre's recent history. Gaines may be a
pseudonym _ complete with an elaborate invented background that
incorporates bits of Dylan, Beatles and Prince lore and parallels
elements of Garth Brooks's life (the solo careers of both begin in
1989, and both have the same number of letters in their first and
last names). But Chris Gaines is very much Garth Brooks, who has
described himself as a melting pot of the past. By Neil Strauss.

   CONDE-NAST-ARCH (New York) _ I hope that the completion of the
new Conde Nast headquarters last month will make people think twice
before complaining about the Disneyfication of Times Square. Things
are better than that, and worse. Disney is but one in a group of
media giants that have chosen to settle here. Besides Conde Nast,
publishers of The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair and other
glamorous titles, the group includes Reuters, Bertelsmann,
Billboard Publications and MTV. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

<P>
   MONROE-PIANO-SALE (New York) _ As grand pianos go, the one going
on the block at Christie's this month is nothing special.
Paderewski did not play it. Neither did Liberace, though he would
have swooned over its fondant-white finish and maybe added some
stylistic flourishes of his own. And as far as Christie's knows, no
one but Marilyn Monroe, its last owner, ever tickled its ivories,
though it is possible that Frank Sinatra, a Monroe beau, might have
plunked out a tune or two. The baby grand piano is a centerpiece of
the sale of Ms. Monroe's personal effects at Christie's new
salerooms at Rockefeller Center on Oct. 27 and 28. By Mitchell
Owens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MARILYN-PERFUME (Los Angeles) _ Over the last couple of years,
the estate of Marilyn Monroe has not been kind to the goddess whose
memory it protects. In 1997, it sanctioned a line of Marilyn Monroe
lingerie. The 50s-style underwear was hawked at department stores.
Now comes an estate-approved perfume called Marilyn, from
International Flavors and Fragrances, the company that has
recreated the essence of Elizabeth Taylor, Victoria Principal and
Christie Brinkley. This takes the concept of celebrity perfume to a
new level: the notion of smelling like a famous dead person _ even
Marilyn Monroe _ is at best an odd one. By Deanne Stillman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-ART (Hatfield, Mass.) _ Putting pictures to words is Barry
Moser's profession, but never has the challenge been greater than
in his latest project: a monumental, fully illustrated version of
the King James Bible. Not only is this the most central, most
revered and surely most contested text in our culture, but it is
one already firmly fixed in our collective minds by religious
inclination and by the countless artists who have already left
their mark. Moser, while keenly aware of those precedents and
preconceptions, has approached this daunting project by returning
to the words themselves to confront familiar stories as if for the
first time. By Miles Under. (Moved).

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOESHA (Undated) _ As everyone in television sounds off about
desires supposedly dear to their hearts _ to see more nonwhite
actors in prime time and to see more shows that the whole family
can enjoy _ the producers and cast of ``Moesha'' have their Oz-like
wish. ``Hey, folks,'' they wonder, ``why not look here in your own
backyard?'' ``Moesha'' (pronounced mo-EESH-a), which has just begun
its fifth season on UPN, is about a family. It has a mix of
characters and plot lines that can engage both adolescents and
adults. And the family, like almost all the supporting characters,
happens to be black. By Lawrie Mifflin. (Moved).

PLOT REPORT IN ISRAEL AND ARRESTS IN JORDAN RENEW FEAR OF HAMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The political and security threat posed by the
militant Islamic movement Hamas got renewed attention Wednesday
when Israeli officials charged that two bombs that exploded
prematurely this month had been intended for passenger buses, and
when Jordan arrested three leaders of Hamas at the Amman airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Ministry of Public Security said four Hamas
plotters, all Israeli Arabs, had planned to bomb two
Jerusalem-bound buses on Sept. 5 after being recruited and trained
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The plot failed when the bombs exploded almost simultaneously in
two cars, one in Tiberias, killing the driver, and another in
Haifa, killing the driver and a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry would not comment on reports that the plot had been
directed by the Hamas office in Amman, where the Jordanian police
seized three longtime leaders of the group Wednesday as they
stepped off a plane from Tehran, Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested included Khaled Meshal, head of the Hamas
``politburo,'' who is best known as the target of a botched
poisoning attempt by Israeli agents in Amman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One month ago, in an unexpected display of displeasure by King
Abdullah, Jordanian authorities issued arrest warrants for the
three men, closed their offices in Amman, rounded up more than a
dozen subordinates and seized what they said were weapons caches.
</P>
<P>
   The warrants coincided with the Hamas leaders' trip to Iran, and
Jordanian officials clearly hoped the men would not return.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security officials said Wednesday that most of the
evidence linking Hamas to the two bombs came from the surviving
member of the team, who the police said had confessed to a plan to
place the bombs in the baggage compartments of the buses and then
disembark at the first scheduled stop.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports said the Shin Bet security service had
identified Hamas operatives in the West Bank as the suppliers of
the detonating devices, and the Hamas office in Jordan as the
coordinator of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Indications that the plot may have been directed from Jordan
could help explain Abdullah's decision to clamp down now. Hamas has
been tolerated by authorities in Jordan because of the support it
enjoys among many Palestinians there.
</P>
<P>
   But the new king has also professed a desire to make Jordan a
supportive bystander rather than an intermediary in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern also appears to be Hamas' influence in Jordan's
politics as the new king takes his first tentative steps toward
democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials said Meshal and a deputy, Ibrahim Ghosheh,
both Jordanian citizens, would face trial on charges related to
illegal political activities and clandestine military training
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The third Hamas activist detained, Musa Abu Marzook, who is said
to hold Yemeni citizenship and Egyptian travel documents, is to be
deported, though to where is uncertain. He was expelled from Jordan
in 1995 after political clashes there, only to be jailed upon his
arrival in the United States. He was re-admitted to Jordan in 1997.

STUDY FINDS SHORTCOMINGS IN CARE FOR CHRONICALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health experts have long known that family members,
particularly women, shoulder a heavy burden in caring for the
dying. But a new study suggests the burden is greatest when the
death is due to chronic illnesses like heart and lung disease,
perhaps because society has paid disproportionate attention to
people who die of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The research, based on interviews with 988 terminally ill
patients and those caring for them, is the first to examine the
role of family members in detail, and the first to look at the
needs of people afflicted with a range of illnesses. Previous
studies focused solely on cancer and dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that patients with chronic illness other than
cancer needed more assistance with nursing, personal and household
care and transportation than cancer patients, in part because
people with cancer are more likely to have hospice care, and were
more likely to have unmet needs. These chronically ill patients
also relied on paid assistance more often; the researchers
theorized that they had been sick for so long that by the time they
were close to death, their family members were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are trying to improve health care in this country for
dying patients and you look at these data, you will say that cancer
care is not perfect but it is under control,'' said the study's
lead author, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, chairman of the Department of
Clinical Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health. ``For
people without cancer, we have a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The research, published in Thursday's issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, found that 41 percent of chronically ill
noncancer patients reported having ``substantial'' need for help
with their daily needs, as opposed to 29 percent of cancer
patients. Twenty-three percent had problems left untended, as
opposed to 15 percent of cancer patients. And 20 percent relied on
paid caregivers, as opposed to 11 percent of cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who care for the dying said the findings confirmed what
they saw in their practices: Cancer patients are fairly
self-sufficient until the last six months of life, when they
deteriorate quickly and often turn to hospice care, a system that
was designed with them in mind. But there is no equivalent system
for other chronically ill patients, who follow more of a
roller-coaster pattern over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a narrative that goes with cancer; everyone
understands that there is a terminal illness, and that it is not
forever,'' said Dr. Diane E. Meier, an expert in end-of-life care
at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It is the family
caregivers of frail, older adults with chronic illness who are
often looking at five, 10 years or longer of being the primary
caregiver for a person who cannot take care of themselves. And that
puts a very different set of stresses on families.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts are just beginning to think about how to ease those
stresses, said Dr. Anne Wilkinson of the Center for Care of the
Dying at George Washington University here.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of Americans die of chronic illness, Wilkinson
said. But, she added, ``we haven't yet identified clearly or
explicitly what kinds of needs they have.'' That is because many
doctors do not recognize these patients as dying, which accounts
for why previous studies have focused so heavily on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 96 percent of primary caregivers _ those
providing dying patients with the most assistance _ were family
members, and 72 percent were women. Yet when women became ill
themselves, they were forced to rely on paid help to a far greater
extent than men, a finding that held true even among women who were
married.
</P>
<P>
   The 988 patients in the study came from six places around the
country, and were referred by their doctors, who estimated that
they had less than six months to live. Nearly 60 percent were older
than 65. Roughly half had cancer; 18 percent had heart disease, and
11 percent had lung disease. Patients with dementia were excluded,
because they could not be interviewed, as were patients with HIV,
Dr. Emanuel said, because they account for only a small percentage
of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the research is important because most of the
existing studies on family caregiving was conducted more than a
decade ago, before managed care revolutionized the American medical
system, forcing shorter hospital stays and placing much greater
responsibilities on relatives. At the same time, the baby boom
generation is aging, forcing policy makers to think about who will
care for greater numbers of dying patients.

   LOS ANGELES _ ``Freaks and Geeks'' grows on you, steadily and
assuredly. The high-school kids on this show aren't the glib,
physically polished, hyper-verbal motormouths that are strewn
across the television landscape these days on shows from ``Dawson's

discussing their feelings, their jokes are sometimes strained,
they're gawky and have teeth and hair and faces that don't look
pathologically fussed over.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how distorted TV's pernicious view of life is
that it's initially disorienting to see such specimens _ real-life
kids you'd see ambling down your street _ actually on TV. Once that
shock wears off, more follow _ here's a TV show that's sensitive
without being treacly, that's funny without being cluttered by
sardonic performances, and is intelligent even though most of its
characters are head-bangers or sci-fi fans.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a Michigan suburban high school in 1980, ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' which premieres tonight, centers around Lindsay Weir
(Linda Cardellini). Her grandmother has recently died, forcing her
to reconsider her values, and she's drifting from her elitist,
smart friends to a clique of burnouts. Her brother Sam (John Daley)
is a classic geek freshman, bullied by toughs (who call him
``weird'') and pining for unattainable cheerleaders (even they look
like real people). Even the teachers can barely mask their
assessment of Sam as a wuss.
</P>
<P>
   Nick (Jason Segel) tries to cheer Lindsay up by getting her to
cut class. His aspiration is to be a rock 'n' roll drummer; six
more additions to his kit and he'll have a bigger set-up than Neil
Peart of Rush. Sam's buddy Neal (Samm Levine) does bad imitations
of pop-culture icons and pragmatically sits idly by while Sam is
hassled by a bully.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Flaherty (``SCTV'') plays Lindsay and Sam's dad, whose every
piece of parental advice includes an anecdote about someone who
broke a rule and died as a result, regardless of what the rule may
have been. ``You know who used to cut class?'' he barks. ``Jimi
Hendrix!'' At least they're more entertaining than the
``when-I-was-your-age'' spiels so many of us had to endure.
Naturally, Lindsay tries to avoid her parents as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Feig created the series, and executive produces it with
Emmy winner Judd Apatow, who has worked on two of the best shows of
the past decade, ``The Ben Stiller Show'' and ``The Larry Sanders
Show.'' Together, they capture the paranoia, confusion and humor
endemic in the ordeal of coming of age. Tonight's episode doesn't
feature any big plot points _ the guys try to survive dodge ball
and a bully; Lindsay's efforts to defend a student with Down
syndrome backfire and she's forced against her will to attend the
homecoming dance _ but it's all engaging and realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Cardellini is the heart and soul of the production, resonantly
conveying her humane character's roiling turmoil as she slowly
begins to realize that, contrary to everything she's been taught,
being a good person doesn't make life any easier.
</P>
<P>
   The grace with which Apatow and Feig depict their coterie of
characters growing awkwardly into adulthood is about the only grace
in the show. ``Freaks and Geeks'' is a series that both teens and
parents can cherish _ but they'll likely be doing it before
separate TVs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Freaks and Geeks.'' &QL; 
What: Hourlong comedy-drama examining the high-school caste system
circa 1980. &QL;

 &HT;    Hanspard has empathy with hurt Anderson
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Byron Hanspard has been down this road before, a
passenger on a bus nobody ever wants to ride, with Jamal Anderson
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Hanspard tore up his left knee in the
final preseason game of 1998, Anderson, his fellow Falcon running
back, was at his side under the Georgia Dome, near tears.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was at the hospital that night until 4 a.m., trying to
get Hanspard to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Hanspard was out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Anderson's out for the season with a torn right anterior
cruciate knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's up to Hanspard to carry the load for the
Falcons, who face quite a task in trying to bounce back from an 0-2
start.
</P>
<P>
   What irony. Hanspard's injury, after all, had a lot to do with
Anderson rushing an NFL-record 410 times last season for franchise
records of 1,846 yards and 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That translated into a five-year, $32 million contract this
summer, when Anderson also got a $7.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard will again caddy for Anderson, this time with
encouragement and advice on bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   It started moments after Anderson was hurt Monday making a cut
on the Texas Stadium turf. Hanspard was right there, leaning over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned for him, and praying for him, that it wasn't
as bad as mine,'' said Hanspard, an ordained Pentecostal minister.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Hanspard almost finds it amusing so many people are
ready to bury the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the 5-foot-10, 200-pounder is a bum.
</P>
<P>
   If the sight of him racing downfield as a rookie in '97 on a
77-yard run that remains the longest in franchise history wasn't
encouraging enough, look longer. He also had runs of 57 and 53
yards to go with a stellar 6.3-yard average per carry.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, the speedy native of Desoto, Texas, returned two
kickoffs for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanspard hears the theories he's not durable enough to
handle the ball as much as Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said. ``Everybody is saying that because I'm
coming off knee surgery ... but the Lord has blessed me to go above
and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hanspard, there is no avoiding references to religion. He
is an ordained Pentecostal minister. His faith was a big help in
rehabilitating what team orthopedist Andrew Bishop once described
as a ``potentially devastating, career-ending injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the primary stabilizing ligament in Hanspard's left
knee torn, but the patella tendon was as well. Bishop cut
Hanspard's right knee and used parts of that patella tendon to mend
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard, who rushed for 2,084 yards as a junior at Texas Tech
before going pro and being drafted by the Falcons in the second
round in 1997, has made an amazing recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has completely healed my knee,'' he said. ``Yes, I have
room for getting it stronger, but it's completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying (his durability is an issue) because I'm
coming off knee surgery . . . but the Lord has blessed me to go
above and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves isn't exactly sure what that means.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson averaged 25.6 carries per game last season. Can
Hanspard measure up to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Reeves said. ``If we are having success
running the ball, then hopefully, he will get it 20 or 25 times a
game. The only thing you worry about is ... swelling or any
soreness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard will probably not carry the ball that often, at least
not most games, as second-year pro Ken Oxendine, who's 6-foot, 230
pounds, will get action, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard is better suited to run wide, and on draws and screen
passes, when defenders are spread out, and he can dart and dash.
Oxendine's style fits the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm capable of running the ball just as well as Jamal
did,'' he said. ``There may be worries for other people, but not
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have little choice but to have faith similar to
Hanspard's.

TESTS FIND NO DRUGS IN ASHBROOK'S SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MAHLBURG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Gene Ashbrook, the paranoid loner who
fatally shot seven people at a Fort Worth church last week before
killing himself, had no drugs in his system, laboratory tests show.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology results showed no trace of illegal drugs, such as
cocaine and heroin, according to Dr. Angela Springfield, chief
toxicologist for the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The tests also found no Prozac, a drug commonly used to treat
depression, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no drugs in his system,'' said Linda Anderson of
the Medical Examiner's Office. ``His toxicology was negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth police said this week that Ashbrook had been taking
Prozac, but they later retracted the statement and said that they
had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A relative described Ashbrook as a paranoid schizophrenic to the
Wise County Sheriff's Department in July. But state mental health
officials said they had no record of contact with Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   A trace amount of alcohol was found during the tests, but
medical officials said the amount was too small to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have taken a teaspoon of cough syrup,'' Anderson
said. ``It would have no effect on anyone's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook seemed to plunge into bizarre and violent behavior
after his 85-year-old father died in July, acquaintances and police
have said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials had also speculated that Ashbrook may have taken
his elderly father's medication shortly before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing changed in the last couple of weeks of the
diary,'' Marjorie Poche of the Dallas FBI office said last week.
``It's only speculation, but he, Larry Ashbrook, may have started
taking his father's medication.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office routinely does toxicology tests
after accidental deaths, homicides or any death involving trauma.
Additional tests for substances such as Prozac were conducted on
Ashbrook, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook's family donated his remains to a Dallas medical school
Tuesday, saying they want to do anything they can to help in the
wake of the tragedy.

NUMBER OF HUMAN GENES IS PUT AT 140,000, A SIGNIFICANT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new calculation of the number of human genes puts the total
far higher than previous estimates, meaning that the human organism
is considerably more complex than hitherto expected.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate, by Incyte Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto,
Calif., sets the number of human genes at 140,000. Each gene
specifies the manufacture of one or more proteins, the working
parts of the body. As the programming instructions of the human
cell, the genes provide all the information needed to develop,
operate and maintain the human organism.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure was announced on Monday night by Dr. Randy Scott,
president and chief scientific officer of Incyte, at a conference
in Miami held by the Institute for Genomic Research.
</P>
<P>
   The number is a sharp upward revision and one that points up how
much there is still to learn about human genetic programming.
</P>
<P>
   The C. elegans roundworm was thought to have about 12,000 genes
until shortly before its genome was sequenced last year, when it
turned out to have 19,099 genes. So humans are receiving the same
kind of upgrade in complexity as the worm.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's company provides genetic information to pharmaceutical
companies, as does its rival, the Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md.,
headed by Dr. J. Craig Venter. Scott's estimate for the total
number of humans genes is double that calculated by Venter five
years ago. At that time, Venter predicted 60,000 to 80,000 human
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Many biologists use the figure of 100,000 human genes, a round
number that implies the exact total could be somewhat more or less.
The Web page of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the
federal agency that provides money for the major part of the human
genome project, estimates that there are 50,000 to 100,000 human
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Genes are small, selected sequences of DNA strung out along the
enormous DNA molecules that form the chromosomes. One reason for
the wide uncertainty over the number of human genes is that there
is no sure way of telling where on a sequence of DNA a gene starts.
</P>
<P>
   In making its new estimate, Incyte scientists depended on that
fact that while biologists cannot recognize where the genes lie on
DNA, human cells can. The cell's machinery transcribes genes into
active copies known as messenger RNA. These cellular messages can
be captured and analyzed before they are naturally degraded.
</P>
<P>
   By decoding the heads and tails of as many messages as they
could find, Incyte biologists figured that the total number of
different genes in the full human DNA, or genome, was 130,000.
Using an independent method, based on a feature known as CG islands
that occur in about half of known genes, Incyte calculated 143,000
genes in every cell of the human body. Putting the two estimates
together produced the figure of 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said that no region of the human genome that had been
decoded so far contained as many genes as the Incyte estimate
implied. His earlier estimate of 70,000 human genes, he said,
assumes that human cells have three billion units of DNA. If the
human genome is 25 percent larger than this, as Celera's recent
work on the fruit fly genome suggests may be the case, Venter said
he would raise his estimate of the number of human gene by 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A publicly financed consortium of university centers has said it
will issue a 90 percent complete draft of the human genome by next
spring.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the last month, Russia has been through what people
in other countries would call mayhem. A low-level war broke out on
the southern border in Dagestan. Then came money-laundering
investigations in the United States and Europe that have implicated
high-ranking Kremlin officials. And in a two-week period, five
terrorist bombings in Moscow and two other cities have left
hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   But to foreign businesses, especially those that have been in
Russia for several years, upheaval seems to be part of the
landscape. Despite all these disturbances, foreigners trading and
manufacturing in Russia have decided to stay put. Portfolio
investors in the Russian stock market have been more skittish, but
few have sold their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business people here have seen a lot worse in Russia,'' said
Charles Hecker, a specialist on the former Soviet Union with the
Control Risks Group, a British corporate-security firm. ``They've
seen tanks in the streets in 1993, and they've survived. The
foreigners who've been here a while are usually from pretty hardy
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   If they were not, the foreign executives would have left long
ago. In the last three years, the period when many corporations
began expanding here, Russia has weathered a politically fraught
presidential race, followed by similarly fraught presidential
quintuple-bypass heart surgery. The nation's currency collapsed.
Its government defaulted on $40 billion of debt, half of it held by
foreigners. Six Cabinets and four prime ministers have come and
gone, the latest one, Vladimir Putin, beginning his tenure only in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Russia was ranked as one of the 10 worst places to do
business by Transparency International, a Berlin-based
anti-corruption organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses in Russia had been in a holding pattern long
before recent events. The breakdown of the economy in August 1998
badly damaged investment, and as a rule, businesses are delaying
any new projects until after the presidential elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the stock market is more sensitive to individual
events than direct investors. The RTS Index, a stock benchmark,
stood at 80.14 at the end of trading Wednesday, down 45 percent
from the 52-week closing high of 147.37 on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Boone, research chief for the Brunswick Warburg brokerage
house here, attributed the decline to Western investors'
nervousness about emerging markets in general.
</P>
<P>
   But the market decline has deepened since the news of the
bombings. And while hedge-fund investors have not sold their Russia
holdings, few seem to be buying either.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings have frightened foreigners much more than the
financial scandals, even though the latter seem to have more to do
with business. The accusations of money-laundering and suggestions
of high-level corruption may be revelations to people outside
Russia, but foreigners here reconciled themselves long ago to the
murkiness of business and upper-echelon politics. ``For those of us
who are ground-level managers of businesses, this has made very
little difference,'' said Eivind Djupedal, head of Cargill
Enterprises in Russia. ``The operating environment has never been
easy here anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances by law enforcement that the bombers will be
found and punished, few investors seem to believe that. ``There's
no confidence among people who know Russia well that the
presidential administration or the government can, or will, solve
these problems,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, executives worry that the Kremlin could use the
instability from the bombings and the money-laundering scandal to
impose a state of emergency and cancel the presidential elections.
It is widely believed that there are people in President Boris
Yeltsin's inner circle who fear facing prosecution when a new
president comes to power and therefore have an interest in trying
to persuade Yeltsin to halt the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has been careful throughout the troubles to
stress that elections will go forward. Some businesses are willing
to believe the official line until they see otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking to elections and thinking, `Will they go
well or not?''' said Scott Blacklin, head of the American Chamber
of Commerce. ``That's what will determine what businesses will do
in Russia.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who thought Cal State Northridge, after
a 71-14 loss at Kansas, was headed for a second-division finish in
the Big Sky Conference, take a look at what happened last week.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State, ranked No. 20 in the USA Today/ESPN Division I-AA
poll, was upset 40-37 on the road by unranked Cal Poly SLO.
Northern Arizona, ranked 16th, was blown out at New Mexico 45-14.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Washington, CSUN's opponent Saturday, was picked to
finish third in the Big Sky by conference coaches but lost at
Portland State 48-39.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona was second in the coaches' poll in July.
Montana State was fifth. If the trend continues, CSUN could luck
out; the Matadors were picked to finish eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they base those (Big Sky) polls on,'' CSUN
interim head coach Jeff Kearin said. ``I couldn't sit here today
and tell you who the favorite is to win this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would say that's Montana, which is ranked No. 2 in
most Division I-AA polls. But the Grizzlies went two overtimes _ at
home _ in their 41-38 win over Sacramento State on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Washington head coach Mike Kramer, whose Eagles are 1-2,
said Montana State's soft schedule _ the Bobcats opened against
Chadron State and Western New Mexico _ made last week's loss not as
surprising. Kramer also wasn't shocked by Montana's struggle
against Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything really is playing true to form,'' Kramer said.
``The conference is gifted and balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said, ``I look at us with a Marcus Brady and wonder how
anyone can count us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hansen hasn't. CSUN is ranked No. 21 in his weekly Division
I-AA Football Gazette Poll.
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting the call: Two weeks ago, Bryson Atkins was so deep on
the depth chart at strong safety, he was playing on the scout team.
Now, because of injuries, the freshman from Alemany High has a shot
at starting against Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The coaches) said they are giving me an opportunity to
play,'' Atkins said. ``I didn't mind redshirting (the season), but
I wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkins is learning the game. He played football only two years
in high school, at San Fernando in 1997 and Alemany in '98, and was
second-team All-Mission League at receiver and defensive back last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Atkins is making the trip to Eastern Washington
because of fellow freshman Travis Campbell's back injury. Campbell
(Westlake) made the travel roster and played briefly at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Campbell) is a freshma, and he was playing,'' Atkins said.
``I took that as motivation. It made me work harder.''
</P>

because of the flu. He is expected to play Saturday. &UR;  &QL;

SEN. KENNEDY SAYS HE'LL SEEK REELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose 37-year career in
the Senate is already one of the longest in US history, intends to
run for reelection not only next November but also in the year
2006, he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have blamed Kennedy for wanting to retire. At age 67,
he has weathered a succession of traumas since his last campaign,
from the death of his mother in 1995 to those of two nephews,
Michael Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., in the past 21 months. He
has worked almost incessantly, colleagues say _ and has built up
such an impressive legislative resume that some privately say he is
at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a term beginning in 2007, he would be 81 and would
have spent nearly two-thirds of his life on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator, who walks on a treadmill five mornings a week
and goes on a yearly low-fat diet, said he has ``every
expectation'' that he will run in the next two elections for his
Senate seat. And his friends, relatives and colleagues were equally
confident he will stay in office as long as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Kennedy said, as he entered the
Senate chamber to cast a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him enjoying a life of leisure,'' said his son,
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island. ``For
him, the most exciting thing is being in the midst of a legislative
battle. He's at home in the Senate. And because seniority is the
nature of the way this place runs, he's going to be at the top of
his game at the twilight of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   After the plane crash that killed John Kennedy Jr. in August,
Kennedy returned to work exhausted and affected by the loss,
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident ``took a lot out of him,'' said Senator Orrin G.
Hatch, Republican of Utah, who considers Kennedy a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added: ``He is going to be here until he's 115 years old.
He wants to beat Strom Thurmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime associate predicted in recent weeks that
Kennedy would do just the opposite, retiring in 2006 to avoid
spending his dotage in the public eye. That associate, however, did
not claim to have talked to Kennedy about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, now 96 years old, is the longest-serving senator in
the history of the United States. If he retires at the end of his
term in 2002 as planned, Thurmond, a Republican from South
Carolina, will have been a senator for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Thurmond and Kennedy, Senator Robert C. Byrd, a
Democrat from West Virginia, is the only member still in office who
makes the list of the ten longest-serving senators. Byrd, 81, ranks
fourth, having been elected to the Senate in 1958 after serving six
years in the US House of Representatives, where he was inaugurated
in 1953, the year Dwight D. Eisenhower became President.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy _ now the ninth-longest serving senator of all time,
elected to office in 1962 _ could ultimately beat them both,
according to Senate Historian Richard A. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   If he campaigns and wins in 2006, Kennedy would have 51 years of
Senate service under his belt by the time that term ended in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming Thurmond and Byrd step down at some point, he could
certainly outlast them all,'' Baker said.

<P>
   TALI, Taiwan _ Though the daylight was gone, a gray-haired woman
stood watching the soldiers as they picked through a small mountain
of rubble to look for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   It was once her son's home, shared with his young wife. More
than 200 others also lived in the 13-story apartment building.
Thirty-nine of them lie here still, including the woman's son and
his wife, both 30, buried somewhere beneath the chunks of concrete
and the twisted wire mesh that now look immovable.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many, if any, are still alive. Together with a
few dozen neighbors the woman watched Wednesday night, sometimes
pacing, sometimes stepping beside a friend for a silent embrace
that seemed to win her a flicker of solace, though it disappeared
as quickly as it came. She remained unwilling to voice the hope
that somehow her son and daughter-in-law might still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't leave,'' said the woman, Tsou Chiu-yu, 62, her eyes
puffy from spending nearly 48 hours at the site. ``I'm not
optimistic. But I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This little town in central Taiwan, near the epicenter of the
enormous earthquake on Monday, seems utterly shell shocked by the
damage, which killed more than 2,000 people, injured countless
others and destroyed thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tsou and many of her neighbors seemed mesmerized by the
swift and decisive nature of the earth's sudden quake, even if they
had not yet taken in the full impact.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers tried to save hundreds of residents trapped in
the rubble in towns throughout central Taiwan, but there were
innumerable sites and the work itself was unavoidably slow and
painstaking.
</P>
<P>
   On Hsientai Street, where Mrs. Tsou's son's apartment building
was ripped from its station and dumped to one side, residents
shuffled cautiously through a narrow and unlighted street to
inspect a broad ripple in one section of pavement that jutted open
like a new doorway to the underworld. In the darkness, it was hard
to see what lay beneath.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Peter Tsai, said it took only 10 seconds for the
building to collapse in a heap. Or half collapse, actually. The
bottom five stories were crushed into rubble, while the top eight
remained intact, though they now lean more distinctly and
precariously than the tower in Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' said Tsai, who said he escaped unhurt from his
ground floor apartment with his wife and child after being trapped
for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed humbled by the experience. ``I don't know why we
lived,'' he said quietly. ``My good friends did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Arun Azarwal, a friend of Tsai's, was visiting Taiwan from his
native India this week. He came to Hsientai Street to watch the
rescue work Wednesday night, mindful of a mutual friend who
remained, and said he found it hard not to meditate on the
tenuousness of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' he said. ``It was the middle of the
night, so I wonder if they even woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, working in camouflage uniforms and hard helmets,
had already dragged four bodies from the wreckage on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the soldiers gingerly took apart piece after
piece of the rubble as they looked for more victims. It must have
looked excruciatingly slow to Mrs. Tsou and others with relatives
and friends buried within, but the half-collapsed building seemed
continually in danger of collapsing even more.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a shout went up. Another victim had been sighted,
deep within the mess. The crowd murmured in excitement, but it soon
became apparent that it could take hours before the soldiers would
get close enough to determine if the person was alive.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of red-shirted rescue workers from a neighboring
county arrived to help, many with flashlights taped to one side of
their helmets, like miners looking for coal in a tunnel. Tsai and a
handful of other residents took charge of directing them, fetching
ladders and pails and rope, and instructing them about leaking gas
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a war,'' marveled Kao Chen-ting, a taxi
driver who stopped to watch the soldiers at work. ``It's big and
it's terrible. You have to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many hours on the sidelines, Mrs. Tsou seemed to lose
some of her stoic demeanor, and vented some frustration that there
was not more help from official channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the government would act in a crisis to save
people,'' she complained. ``Where are they? What have they done for
us? Why do we have to endure this on our own?''

SEN. KENNEDY SAYS HE'LL SEEK REELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose 37-year career in
the Senate is already one of the longest in US history, intends to
run for reelection not only next November but also in the year
2006, he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have blamed Kennedy for wanting to retire. At age 67,
he has weathered a succession of traumas since his last campaign,
from the death of his mother in 1995 to those of two nephews,
Michael Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., in the past 21 months. He
has worked almost incessantly, colleagues say _ and has built up
such an impressive legislative resume that some privately say he is
at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a term beginning in 2007, he would be 81 and would
have spent nearly two-thirds of his life on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator, who walks on a treadmill five mornings a week
and goes on a yearly low-fat diet, said he has ``every
expectation'' that he will run in the next two elections for his
Senate seat. And his friends, relatives and colleagues were equally
confident he will stay in office as long as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Kennedy said, as he entered the
Senate chamber to cast a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him enjoying a life of leisure,'' said his son,
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island. ``For
him, the most exciting thing is being in the midst of a legislative
battle. He's at home in the Senate. And because seniority is the
nature of the way this place runs, he's going to be at the top of
his game at the twilight of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   After the plane crash that killed John Kennedy Jr. in August,
Kennedy returned to work exhausted and affected by the loss,
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident ``took a lot out of him,'' said Senator Orrin G.
Hatch, Republican of Utah, who considers Kennedy a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added: ``He is going to be here until he's 115 years old.
He wants to beat Strom Thurmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime associate predicted in recent weeks that
Kennedy would do just the opposite, retiring in 2006 to avoid
spending his dotage in the public eye. That associate, however, did
not claim to have talked to Kennedy about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, now 96 years old, is the longest-serving senator in
the history of the United States. If he retires at the end of his
term in 2002 as planned, Thurmond, a Republican from South
Carolina, will have been a senator for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Thurmond and Kennedy, Senator Robert C. Byrd, a
Democrat from West Virginia, is the only member still in office who
makes the list of the ten longest-serving senators. Byrd, 81, ranks
fourth, having been elected to the Senate in 1958 after serving six
years in the US House of Representatives, where he was inaugurated
in 1953, the year Dwight D. Eisenhower became President.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy _ now the ninth-longest serving senator of all time,
elected to office in 1962 _ could ultimately beat them both,
according to Senate Historian Richard A. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   If he campaigns and wins in 2006, Kennedy would have 51 years of
Senate service under his belt by the time that term ended in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming Thurmond and Byrd step down at some point, he could
certainly outlast them all,'' Baker said.

SILICON VALLEY RESEARCH LAB IS CHANGING ITS DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Silicon Valley research laboratory,
established seven years ago to leapfrog generations of computer
technologies, is taking a narrower direction that reflects the
changing interests of the Microsoft co-founder who financed it.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the change, David E. Liddle, a prominent
computer scientist who founded the laboratory, Interval Research
Corp., has stepped down as director. Liddle's relationship with
Paul Allen, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder who seeded Interval with
a $100 million investment over 10 years, grew strained in the past
year, several employees said, as Allen increasingly pushed Interval
to focus its research on his business strategy in the cable
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Interval's original vision was to emulate the pioneering
tradition of Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center, known as
PARC, a hotbed of computer innovation in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle will remain chairman of Interval, which like Xerox's PARC
laboratory, is in Palo Alto, Calif., but will no longer be involved
in the organization's day-to-day activities, according to the
employees. His former executive management duties will be shared by
Arati Prabhakar, who joined Interval as vice president for research
in December 1998, and Douglas Solomon, who as vice president of its
advanced development activities since October 1998 has been
responsible for the commercialization of research results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have simply formalized something that has been under way
for some time,'' Liddle said Wednesday. He said he hoped to focus
on the opportunity presented by high-speed multimedia networks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment Wednesday, Allen's office referred queries to
Liddle.
</P>
<P>
   When Interval was founded, Allen said he was making a 10-year
financing commitment to support as many as 100 computer scientists
and researchers. Wednesday, the laboratory employs about 70 people.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle was a research scientist at PARC in the 1970s, when the
center was developing many of the ideas and technologies that have
shaped today's computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   PARC pioneered a wide range of technologies, including the laser
printer, the Ethernet office network and the ``graphical user
interface,'' the combination of multiwindow computer screens and
point-and-click navigation on which Apple Computer's Macintosh and
Microsoft's Windows operating system were modeled.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, while other companies grew rich adapting PARC's
inventions, Xerox itself was never successful in personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle said he wanted to copy much of the philosophical approach
of the PARC researchers, who treated computer power as plentiful,
memory chips as cheap and data networks as commonplace long before
those technologies were commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he made it clear he was not interested in merely
repeating the PARC experience at Interval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to go in a fundamentally different direction,'' he
said in 1992. ``That vision at PARC has been driving the industry
for a long time. We are not trying to build on that vision but to
construct a new one.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after it was founded, Interval began to shift its
strategy toward a more business-oriented and less open-ended
research focus. In 1996, the research firm announced the first of
four projects being spun off as venture-financed start-ups. To
date, none have been notably successful, and Purple Moon, a
software firm started by an Interval researcher, Brenda Laurel,
went bankrupt this year before being sold to Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked in areas where we found that commercialization has
been very hard,'' Liddle said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, employees said, Interval has shifted its efforts to
areas like market research for the cable industry and developing
technologies for delivering interactive multimedia products and
content over cable, both of which serve the immediate needs of
Allen's rapidly expanding cable empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a vision of a wired world, and Paul is at the center
of it,'' Liddle said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Liddle and Allen had been close until recently _ the
two would fly around the country in Allen's jet and would play rock
music together on guitars _ their relationship has suffered in
recent years. Allen has become more involved in day-to-day
activities at Interval, and his mother and sister have also played
a role in some decisions, according to people close to the research
center's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working for Paul is about working for a family business in the
final analysis,'' said a consultant with close ties to the cable
industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moreover, in recent years the growing perception in Silicon
Valley has been that Interval is not able to make the kinds of big
breakthroughs that were the trademark of Xerox's PARC in the 1970s
and of SRI International in the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   That view has been accented by Liddle's management style, which
has been to keep research at Interval under tight secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry analysts have come to believe that Liddle's
challenge in trying to orchestrate breakthroughs was formidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating a community of people making a revolution is not
something that can be forced or ordered,'' said James F. Moore,
president of Geopartners and a computer and telecommunications
industry consultant. ``Xerox PARC was a fortuitous event. There
have been lots of other research greenhouses that have never
created flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting more than a year ago, Allen began refocusing the
research at Interval toward the needs of his Charter Communications
cable company which has been aggressively consolidating smaller,
second-tier cable companies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The more pragmatic focus has led to several defections by
researchers but nothing approaching an exodus. But in interviews
Wednesday, several Interval employees said they were unsure about
the long-term future of the laboratory and whether Allen would
continue to finance the center.

PIRATES FLOODED OUT BY HURRICANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the only team in the nation being held hostage, without
a home, or for that matter, a campus.
</P>
<P>
   That's the predicament facing East Carolina, which is spending
the week in Columbia, S.C., where it played South Carolina last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd closed a number of roads and
highways in and around Greenville, N.C., where the school is
located.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates are forced to stay in Columbia as they prepare for
this week's ``home'' game against Miami. Part of Greenville is
without electricity, and the drinking water isn't safe. School is
closed for the week.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 players, roughly one-fourth of the team, lost their
belongings. They happened to live near the Tar River, which has
overrun its banks in record flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their apartments are gone and everything they own is gone,''
East Carolina coach Steve Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding has even caused Saturday's game to be moved from
East Carolina to North Carolina State, which is located about 70
miles west in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have practiced at the University of South Carolina
in the morning. The Gamecocks have the facilities in the afternoon.
Logan and his staff have used makeshift video and scouting
facilities and meeting rooms while trying to maintain a sense of
normalcy in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're practicing, that's the only time we're not worrying
about what's going on back home,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan has had to keep his team entertained. They went to the
movies Monday and Tuesday, and Wednesday they went bowling. It has
all made Logan uncertain about how his team will play against the
Hurricanes (no pun intended).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play,'' Logan said. ``I just don't know how
WELL we'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The feud continues: The sniping between Colorado and
Washington has not subsided as the teams prepare for Saturday's
encounter in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel, who is now at Washington,
picked at the scabs of the rivalry by saying that comments Colorado
coach Gary Barnett made in a CNN/SI interview last spring portrayed
Neuheisel as a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were comments he made . . . that questioned my veracity,
whether I was telling the truth regarding recruiting (violations)
and so forth,'' Neuheisel said. ``And I don't know where where he
comes off questioning that.''
</P>
<P>
   After violating an NCAA ``quiet'' recruiting period last winter
(Washington assistants were in recruits' homes on the Sunday before
signing day), Neuheisel was penalized by the Pacific-10 Conference.
Neuheisel called it an ```honest mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained later that his NCAA rule book had not been unpacked
after his move from Boulder to Seattle _ which Colorado's
compliance office is still laughing about.
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN/SI interview, Barnett said he answered, ``Only Rick
knows that,'' when asked if he believed if Neuheisel knew he was
violating NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant just what I said: He's the only one that knows,''
Barnett said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barnett continues to use props to motivate his team.
He entered last Thursday night's team meeting dressed in fatigues,
boots and helmet perched above a blackened face as the Buffaloes
prepared to face Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   A clip of Gen. George S. Patton's impassioned pre-battle speech
from the movie ``Patton'' had been plugged in and was ready to roll
on a giant screen in the team auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   In Barnett's minidrama, a tape played behind him showing the
final minutes of the Buffaloes' 33-17 loss last fall at Kansas.
There were also blown-up newspaper accounts of one of Neuheisel's
14 defeats in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defeated Kansas 51-17.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hidden treasure: Indiana quarterback Antwaan Randle-El is not
nationally known, but he should be. He ran for 115 yards and three
touchdowns and passed for 201 yards and one score in a 44-35 loss
to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Randle-El has rushed for over 1,000 career yards and passed for
more than 2,000 yards, and done both faster than any player in NCAA
history.
</P>
<P>
   He passed those standards in 13 games, five less than it took
Minnesota quarterback Ricky Foggie, six less than Major Harris
required at West Virginia and eight less than Michael Bishop of
Kansas State needed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Badge of courage: Give Central Florida some credit for its
schedule. The Knights are in the midst a brutal opening. The
Division I-A school from Orlando, which is playing its first season
without quarterback Daunte Culpepper, opened against Purdue before
playing at Florida and Georgia Tech, where the Knights lost 41-10
on Saturday. This week, they take a trip to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   __ Poll problems: Before taking the top-25 polls too seriously,
keep this in mind: One voter has ranked Virginia Tech No. 1 since
the preseason, while another voter forgot to put No. 15 Kansas
State in his top 25 last weekend. &QL; 
SCOTT WOLF'S TOP 10 &QL; 
__ 1. Florida State (3-0) _ 'Noles became first team in '90s to win
100 games (100-13-1). &QL; 
__ 2. Florida (3-0) _ Gainesville declares Spurrier's visor a local
landmark. &QL; 
__ 3. Penn State (4-0) _ If Arrington stays away from punter, he'll

 &HT;    Too much death for N.C. towns
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ Not all the dead are resting after Hurricane
Floyd killed more than 40 people in North Carolina and unearthed
coffins along swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Wilson, sobbing relatives Wednesday buried three
of the storm's victims, killed when a boat capsized last week near
Pinetops. But widespread flooding has delayed other burials across
eastern North Carolina, devastated by the state's worst natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Coffins and vaults bobbing in floodwaters have become an
unsettling sight, and some survivors don't want to bury their loved
ones in muddy graves. In nearby towns such as Rocky Mount, high
water separates bodies stored in hospital morgues from out-of-town
kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrible,'' said Brenda Wright, nursing supervisor at
Nash General Hospital in Rocky Mount. Its morgue has room for
eight, prompting officials to bring in a refrigerated
tractor-trailer for Floyd's victims.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, three of the hospital's 10 storm dead had been
delivered to funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven were in the trailer, partly to prevent the
odor of decomposing flesh from fouling the morgue, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three graves in Pinetops have been ripped apart by
flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state officials said floating corpses in caskets pose far
less of a health risk than widespread municipal and farm sewage
spills.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the spread of disease, officials are scrambling to
dispose of more than 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000
turkeys that drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no health risk involved with an embalmed body,'' said
Jeff Winstead, an official with the state's emergency response team
in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The state medical examiner's office has a procedure for
identifying and reinterring corpses, Winstead said. But considering
the sewage and livestock threats, he said, ``That is not one of the
emergency issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As waters recede, Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical
examiner, said he expects the official death toll of 41 to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we expecting the number to increase? Yes,'' Wright said.
``It may be three or four more. It may be 10 more. I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aynor, embalmer Don Brown prepared two bodies over the
weekend, but flooding prevented him from releasing them to funeral
homes in Williamston and Elizabeth City.
</P>
<P>
   Rest Haven Cemetery in Wilson had dried out enough for
Wednesday's burial of Ben and Vivian Mayo and their 23-year-old
daughter, Keisha Vines. Vines' 5-year-old daughter, Tekisha, also
apparently died, but her body was not found until Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate,'' Josephine Edwards, director of Edwards
Funeral Home, said as she greeted some of the several hundred
people who attended the two-hour service at the L.N. Forbes
Original Free Will Baptist Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   The three Mayo family members from Pinetops were among six
people who drowned a week ago in flooding from Town Creek in
Edgecombe County. Remembered during the service as a hero who tried
to save neighbors, Ben Mayo, 50, had steered the boat that
overturned, killing half the 12 aboard in Hurricane Floyd's most
deadly accident.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile away, a 6- to 8-foot swell rushed across the
low ground along Town Creek and unearthed two vaults in an old
cemetery along Bynum Farm Road.
</P>
<P>
   A third hole is empty, but Pinetops Mayor Earl Coker said he's
not sure whether it had contained a casket.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a week since flooding uncovered the stone vaults.
</P>
<P>
   One was turned on its side, with one end pointing into the sky.
Another poked from the ground, its lid ajar. Etching on the cover
identified the deceased as ``James Cobb,'' who died May 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Another who is buried there is Simpson Cobb. His widow's
brother, B.C. Pitt of Pinetops, said it could be days before the
small graveyard is tended.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who look after the cemetery have been flooded
out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that happened beyond our control,'' said Pitt,
who is staying at the emergency shelter in Carver Elementary School
in Pinetops.
</P>
<P>
   If residents are able to restore the graves, volunteer fire and
rescue Chief Steve Bynum said, ``the county will make sure they are
taken care of.''

NATIONAL ANGLING EVENT MIGHT BE ON WAY OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall for outdoorsmen is ushered in by deer season, waterfowl
hunting, rockfishing . . . and, most important, the state's
biannual Free Fishing Day.
</P>
<P>
   That day is Saturday, when the usual requirement of possessing a
fishing license is waived in an attempt to draw more people into
the wonderful world of angling. So, yes, Virginia, there is such a
thing as a free lunch _ if you actually catch something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows for the opportunity to learn and enjoy the
experience of fishing . . . because it's free. To see how you like
the sport before investing more time and money,'' said Elaine
Fischer, a fish and wildlife interpreter in the Department of Fish
and Game's Long Beach office.
</P>
<P>
   And if the only day of the year you decide to fish is Saturday,
it represents a savings of $27.55 on an annual resident
sport-fishing license (or $10 for a two-day license).
</P>
<P>
   It's the DFG's version of a get-out-of-jail-free card, except,
I'll have you know, that all other fishing rules regarding such
things as angling hours, bait restrictions and size and possession
limits still apply to any waters where fishing is permitted. So
brush up on the DFG's ``Sport Fishing Regulations'' handbook if
you're at all in doubt. (Anglers 15 and younger get a year-round
reprieve, never needing to have a fishing license.)
</P>
<P>
   Free fishing is the great news. The bad news is that the brakes
are being applied to fall's national equivalent of Free Fishing
Day. Unfortunately, National Hunting and Fishing Day is being
phased out by its organizers. But more on that later; I'm
definitely the type of guy who likes the good news before the bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is designed by the DFG as a way to ensure its future.
The notion is that by bringing in new blood, fishing will continue
to flourish. Sage wisdom. My applause.
</P>
<P>
   To court prospective anglers, a free catfishing derby is slated
Saturday from 8 to 11 a.m. at La Mirada Park Lake, 13701 S. Adelfa
Ave. in La Mirada.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can borrow a loaner rod and reel,'' Fischer said. ``Many
people get very interested that way in a sport they've never tried
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Trophies will be doled out to youngsters with the heaviest
catches. A complimentary pancake breakfast will kick the event off
at 7 a.m. Information: (626) 333-1369. (See Page 14 for a map and
listing of other fishing holes.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the second part of the annual equation for this
special fourth Saturday of September has traditionally been
National Hunting and Fishing Day. Designated in 1972 by
then-president Richard Nixon, it was set aside to encourage
participation, conservation and safety in outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28th annual festivity has lost its luster. Its sponsor,
the National Shooting Sports Foundation, is phasing out National
Hunting and Fishing Day in favor of another program called Step
Outside. Step Outside invites experienced recreationists to bring
uninitiated friends and family members on hunting, shooting and
fishing excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(National Hunting and Fishing Day) is one day of the year and
Step Outside is more encompassing,'' explained National Shooting
Sports Foundation spokeswoman Colleen Swain.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but methinks you can't underestimate that
unique day.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, details on such essential matters as what states
honor National Hunting and Fishing Day and where events are being
staged were provided. Apparently that's a thing of the past.
``We're cutting down, that's basically why,'' Swain said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a shame, for example, that NHFD's national director,
C.D. ``Chris'' Chaffin, chose this particular week to be away from
the National Shooting Sports Foundation's Newtown, Conn.,
headquarters and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Swain remains upbeat about NHFD. ``I don't think interest will
dwindle,'' she said. ``Those sportsmen's clubs and individuals who
promote these things will continue to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several states likely will carry the National Hunting
and Fishing Day flame, but when the coach loses interest in the
remainder of the season, it's hard to rally the team.
</P>
<P>
   Call the National Shooting Sports Foundation at (203) 426-1320
to get involved in next year's National Hunting and Fishing Day, if
it's still around then. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR VENTURA, THE CHANCE IS THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robin Ventura doesn't say much; in the parlance of
media scouting reports on players, the Mets third baseman is ``not
a talker.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-key, unassuming, a kindred spirit with his infield soulmate
John Olerud, a contrast to Edgardo Alfonzo and Rey Ordonez at
short. The mild-mannered third baseman stays out of the limelight
and allows his performance to do his talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I know, and I'm fine with it,'' Ventura said.
``You can go and do crazy things like Dennis Rodman does. But this
is just the way I am. John Olerud's the same way: you just go and
play, go home and come back the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   With 11 games to go in a great season, Ventura, an integral part
of the Mets' $164 million push to close the gap with Atlanta, is
hitting .306. He has been a National League player of the week this
season, and he became the first player in major league history to
hit a grand slam in each game of a doubleheader, on May 20 against
Milwaukee. In his last 59 games he is hitting .355 with 14 home
runs and 49 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Ventura has been part of what may be the best
defense in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Ventura was focused on the big picture of this
season, not whether the Mets catch or pass Atlanta and win the
division. The big picture for a 32-year-old veteran is savoring a
moment that doesn't come around that often.
</P>
<P>
   In nine seasons with the Chicago White Sox, Ventura played in
one American League championship series _ the 1993 White Sox played
Toronto. After that season, Chicago was in a perpetual rebuilding
mode and Ventura spent much of his time breaking in young players
and new faces, and adjusting to new management teams and styles
that ended in the same dismal result.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, Ventura has enjoyed one of the most
exhilarating seasons of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still being in this position when you've not been in this
position for this long,'' Ventura said. ``It's still fun; you're
not making plans to go home. It's fun coming to the park not
knowing what's going to happen. That's what makes it a lot of fun
for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, along with Rickey Henderson, has given the Mets a
consistency that has been reflected in their performance since the
All-Star Game break. The Mets have played 20 series and have won
18. They have won them by three games to one, two games to one;
they have never swept a team and have never been swept.
</P>
<P>
   While everything else is splendid, Ventura's problem is also the
Mets' problem: they both have trouble with Atlanta. The team and
the player have had nightmares against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday night's game, Ventura had managed just 2
singles in 23 at-bats with 10 strikeouts against Braves pitching.
Last July 4 at Shea Stadium, he bunted with runners on first and
second and no outs. On Tuesday he was 0 for 3 against John Smoltz.
Wednesday night he grounded out, struck out and walked in his first
three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this team over all is made up where two guys are
going to do it or one guy is going to do it,'' Ventura said.
``Everybody has to pitch in for us to win, and I don't see that
changing now. It's going to take a total team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think you go at it the same way you have all year,'' he
added. ``I don't think you try to create everything that isn't
there. It's still a game, and you still try to do the same things
you've been doing all year. You still try to hit the ball the same
way you have earlier in the year. You can't try harder. When you do
that, you end up making mistakes. We just have to keep playing, and
hopefully it turns around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams hope. Other teams make it happen. The Mets are in
transition between hoping and making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about the urgency of this moment or the next
week, Ventura said he learned from playing with the White Sox to
have fun with a positive experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then you could tell,'' he said, ``by talking with the
people who had been there, that every year is different, and if you
win you don't treat it like it's going to happen forever, even
though you try to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ventura silently savors the moments, good and bad. ``You
learn to appreciate what you're going through and just have fun
with it,'' he said. ``Win or lose, these two weeks are going to be
a lot better than the two weeks of knowing that you're going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets caught up in the `I'm going to get my heart
broken thing.' But I'd rather have it broken than have it already
squashed.'' &QL;

INVESTMENTS OF STATE FUNDS BY COMPANY THAT DIDN'T MEET GUIDELINES
LOST VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Public school funds invested by a Dallas firm
have shrunk by millions of dollars, failing to keep pace with other
school fund investments and industry averages, records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not meeting guidelines set by the State Board of
Education, Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney &AMP; Strauss was among nine firms
awarded contracts by the board in 1997 to manage portions of the
$19 billion state Permanent School Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the State Board said members were not told that
Barrow, Hanley did not meet the minimum guidelines, and has
expressed concern about how the contracts were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   According to records, the company in 1998 began managing
investments of $200 million from the fund _ a public endowment used
to pay for textbooks, and managed by the State Board of Education.
But by June 30 of this year, the market value of the investments
had fallen to about $179 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrow, Hanley investments underperformed those of the eight
other money managers hired by the State Board in 1997. The Barrow,
Hanley investments, however, outperformed others investing in
similar equities during the three-month period ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is the firm's policy not to discuss
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Firm partner Michael Mewhinney is a close friend and former
business associate of Gov. George W. Bush. In 1993, Mewhinney owned
3.7 percent of the Texas Rangers at the same time Bush served as
the team's general managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   Mewhinney announced his retirement from Barrow, Hanley on May
26, saying he planned to work on the governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush has said the governor played no role in
selecting money managers for the Permanent School Fund. Likewise,
the spokeswoman said Mewhinney had no formal position with the Bush
campaign, nor had any formal position been proposed for him.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballard, acting director of the Permanent School Fund, said
Barrow, Hanley uses an investment strategy that did not pay off
when the company first received the investment contract.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the strategy appears to have been more
successful in recent months, when the Barrow, Hanley investments
outperformed other small/mid cap equity investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buy deep, boring stocks _ those that are not very sexy _
like a barge company with a good cash flow,'' he said. ``It's the
kind of market that does well when the global economy starts to
pick up. But the style doesn't work all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But former State Board member Jack Christie, who was chairman of
the panel when the contracts were awarded in 1997, said he would
rethink the contracts if he found that any of the fund managers had
lost money after one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would red-flag my desire to continue,'' said Christie, a
Republican from Houston. ``As long as we've had outside money
managers, none of them were in a deficit for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   State Board Chairman Chase Untermeyer said this week that he
might ask the board to reconsider all the money management
contracts it has awarded since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer said a newly hired financial consultant will review
the board's investment policy and submit recommendations to the
board at its next meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer earlier wrote the office of Attorney General John
Cornyn asking for an investigation into whether unspecified money
managers misled the board or misdirected Permanent School Fund
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at (Barrow, Hanley), as well as all the other
money managers,'' Untermeyer said Tuesday. ``Money managers should
be judged on the basis of performance _ that should be the board's
primary concern. But I have been told that you need to look at it
over a period of time. ... You can't do it on the basis of one
quarter or one year.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has said Cornyn is considering
Untermeyer's request.
</P>
<P>
   According to a review of Permanent School Fund investments
prepared for the board by a Dallas consulting firm, the investments
made by Barrow, Hanley lost 5 percent of their net value between
July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the consultants' report showed, the median
value of similar small/mid cap equity investments by other money
managers nationwide rose 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter for which information was available _ the
months of April, May and June _ Barrow, Hanley's Permanent School
Fund investments grew by 18.6 percent _ higher than the industry
median of 15.8 percent, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, Hanley was one of four firms hired specifically to make
investments in the stocks of small and mid-sized corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that investments handled by one of the
three other firms _ Harbor Capital _ fell by 3.62 percent in the
one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The value of those Permanent School Funds invested in
small/mid-cap equities increased overall from $800 million to
$806.5 million since the contracts were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Education has paid Barrow, Hanley more than
$1 million, despite their investments' loss of value.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, Hanley received the Permanent School Fund investment
contract even though their proposal did not meet guidelines set
forth by the State Board, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In submitting their proposal, for example, the firm showed less
than two years' returns in placing small/mid cap equity investments
_ even though the initial screening document on the state board's
bid request called for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, Hanley stated in its proposal that it could claim a
five-year track record by counting previous investments made by a
manager while working at a different company.
</P>
<P>
   The initial screening questionnaire also called for ``at least
five investment professionals dedicated full time to the services
proposed.'' The company reported it had two such professionals,
although those two worked with a larger team handling other sorts
of investments.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Education received 55 applications for firms
to handle small/midcap equities investments, records show. Of
those, Barrow, Hanley were ranked 50th and 51st on two listings
prepared by financial consultant Fred C. Seponara, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 15 State Board members, who are elected by
districts, now say that Texas Education Agency officials _ as well
as Seponara _ did not provide sufficient information.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Neill, a Fort Worth Republican on the board, said that
the initial screening questionnaire set forth ``minimum eligibility
criteria'' and that Seponara did not inform the board of Barrow,
Hanley's lack of a track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned,'' he said. ``We were not provided any of
that information.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a ``manager search quality control'' document provided
by Seponara to the board after the contract awards indicated that
Barrow, Hanley answered yes to all the preliminary questions on the
initial screening questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Seponara's report also indicated that Barrow, Hanley is
``domiciled in Texas'' _ even though records show that the company
is owned by United Asset Management, a Boston firm.
</P>
<P>
   Seponara, reached at his Blue Bell, Pa., office, could provide
no explanation as to why his firm's quality control document
contained apparently erroneous information about the firm.

TRUTH IS, `LIAR' TAKES THE COWARD'S WAY OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tradition of short stories in which deception and pain
devastate the life of the protagonist can be found in the novel
``Jakob the Liar'' by Jurek Becker (Penguin, $11.95). But if you're
looking for similar complexity in the film adaptation starring
Robin Williams at his dampest and neediest, you'd be advised to
give the book another shot. Williams is Jakob, detained in a
Nazi-occupied ghetto with thousands of other Jews. While waiting
for humiliation at the hands of a Nazi, Jakob happens to overhear
on the Nazis' radio a piece of news that is so powerful even the
Nazi propaganda machine can't put too good a face on it: Russian
forces are threatening to overrun the Germans at the Polish border,
not too far from the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The news is too much for Jakob. He leaks it to a slow-witted but
well-meaning boxer friend (Liev Schreiber), who not only blabs
about the possibility of Soviet saviors but also says that Jakob
has a secret radio. This misinformation gives a cast including
Armin Mueller-Stahl, Alan Arkin and, most embarrassingly, Bob
Balaban a chance to compete for the most eye-moistening attention.
Coming after the stylized approach of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which
dealt with the Holocaust in similar terms, ``Jakob'' has almost no
chance of gaining an audience. For the material to work, the movie
would have to be a lot more daring in its mix of bleak humor and
hopelessness, focusing on a narrator and central figure who is
essentially unreliable. (His unreliability is the point of the
story.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob'' is too intent on winning us over to gamble on such a
stratagem. Its timidity, flinching from a great subject, results in
an ending determined to make audiences leave the theater feeling
uplifted. Maybe the Robin Williams who starred in ``The World
According to Garp'' would've been up for starring in a film about
finding slivers of hope only to have them dashed before your eyes,
or for playing a man who was untrustworthy instead of someone
ennobled by torment. Nowadays, he might have forced a happy ending
even on ``Garp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' is rated PG-13 for adult subject matter,
violence and mild sexuality. .MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

`ER' PRODUCER DELIVERS A SPINOFF _ STAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After making ``ER'' a respected drama and a ratings winner,
producer John Wells has been trying to duplicate the creative magic
elsewhere, with little success. ``Trinity,'' a cop-based family
drama, did not win respect or ratings last season and was shown the
door. This year, Wells got a hand in NBC's ``The West Wing'' as an
executive producer (although it's considered Aaron Sorkin's baby),
and two more dramas are reportedly waiting on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he revisits his ``ER'' stomping grounds to introduce
yet another series, and in a Hollywood where you're only as good as
the gap between hits, it's not surprising that ``Third Watch'' is
as close to an ``ER'' spinoff as it can be, without Wells and NBC
actually calling it one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' which will air Sundays, is like ``ER: Life on
the Street.'' It focuses on firefighters, paramedics and cops who
work the 3-to-11 p.m. shift. You've seen these folks before. These
are the no-name heroes who zip in and out of ``ER,'' barking orders
about vital signs. Now we get them front and center and see how
they patch up the injured before wheeling them through hospital
corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has concocted another series that moves like a runaway
freight train, crunching everything in its way. Story lines are
soapy and layered, and there's a similar multiple-lead character
structure. Michael Beach, whom you'll remember as Jeanie Boulet's
HIV-positive ex-husband on ``ER,'' seems to be in the position to
serve as the show's center. That would be refreshing, particularly
this season, considering all the fuss over the lack of minority
leads.
</P>
<P>
   Beach plays a paramedic, a nurturer, the levelheaded team leader
called ``Doc.'' Bobby Cannavale and Kim Raver are the others, and
both are holdovers from Wells' ``Trinity.'' Everyone else is
relatively unknown and will have to fend for themselves in getting
good story lines.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a problem. As it was in the early days of
``ER,'' narrative is pared to the bare essentials. There are
veteran cops, green rookies, hotheads. A paramedic in love with
another paramedic whose ex-husband works with them. ``Why did we
break up anyhow?'' he wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk. Talk that's quick and terse and to the
point since, well, these people rarely have time.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran cop to rookie: ``What are we doing out here?''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: ``Enforcing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: ``No. We're solving problems. We go from job to job,
solving problems as quickly as we can. Then we come up, go to
another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening episode alone, a woman drops her baby from a
burning high-rise apartment building, a paramedic is sprayed with
gunfire, a woman gives birth on a subway train, a paramedic rushes
to her ambulance shouting, ``I love this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of ``Third Watch'' is borrowed, there are no
stylistic breakthroughs, and the dialogue is straight from the
Heros' Handbook. It's entertaining, at least. Which is more than
half the battle in a season in which you'll be shocked as to what
is being passed off as such. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also new Thursday: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Neil Patrick Harris, Tony Shalhoub
</P>
<P>
   Eccentric bestselling horror writer Ian Stark (Shalhoub from
``Wings'') is driving his neurotic editor (''Doogie Howser M.D.'s''
Harris) crazy. How? Practical jokes, mostly. And touching him. Like
putting his hand on his shoulder. Harris' Henry McNeely is a
bookish little creep who can't handle germs or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   It's a run-of-the-mill buddy comedy that will have to get much
better than its pilot to survive three years, which is how long NBC
Thursday-night comedies seem to last these days. One year for NBC
to notice that it's a clunker, another year while it switches to
another night, and a third year for it to get pummeled in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' could also refer to anyone who decides to
make this ``must see TV.'' Do yourself a favor and watch ``Action''
on Fox.  &QL;

 ONLINE DISGUISES FROM PRYING EYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
The Internet is watching your every move. Web sites pelt your
browser with ``cookie'' files that store information about you.
You've told total strangers your name, address, age, income and
marital status, all for free e-mail accounts and contests. No less
an authority than Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun
Microsystems, said this year: ``You have zero privacy anyway. Get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to get over it. You can get around it.
</P>
<P>
   Several software products, some free, let people disguise their
identities online so they can surf without giving up their personal
data. These products help consumers delete privacy-invading cookies
and serve up bogus identities to Web sites that are avid to know
all about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, you can feel like you're online and don't
have a camera over your shoulder,'' said Dov Smith, spokesman for
Zero-Knowledge Systems, a Canadian software firm with privacy
protection software being prepared for release.
</P>
<P>
   The new products work in different ways. Some let people surf by
using servers at remote locations as intermediaries, scrambling the
user's true identity. Others put encrypting software onto the
users' computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new tools are called ``privacy enhancers,'' said Jason
Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey consulting
firm that makes one of the free software products.
</P>
<P>
   The products are necessary, advocates say, because of the way
people freely shed their privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has developed as an intimate medium, more than
the U.S. mail or the telephone,'' said Robert Ellis Smith,
publisher of Privacy Journal in Providence, R.I. ``They communicate
with the screen and think it's an opportunity to exchange sensitive
information without repercussions. They think the (information)
will be protected. People are shocked to discover it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   People may post a question or comment to an Internet newsgroup,
unaware that this ``tentative, unedited thought ... will be
archived and can be retrieved,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   As Zero-Knowledge's Smith puts it: ``If you're 14 years old and
you post to a newsgroup, `My parents just put me on Prozac because
I'm depressed,' that comment is there, and any moderately
Internet-savvy future employer or insurer or date can go to the
site and get the statement. And that's just the tip of the
iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Privacy Journal said the Internet has even made
window-shopping something that can be tracked. ``Never before has
it been possible to keep a log of when you handle the
merchandise,'' he said. ``All of that can be recorded and exploited
later to reach you in your home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where privacy enhancing software comes in. The leading
examples of this new breed are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Web Incognito from Privada (www.privada.net): For $5 a month,
this software from San Jose's Privada compartmentalizes and
encrypts various information so that no one can make a connection
between a Web identity _ the name, password and personal data you
give to Web sites _ and a real-world identity. Cookies _ the files
that Web sites store on your hard drive to track your movements and
remember your passwords _ are stored on Privada servers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Anonymizer (www.anonymizer. com): Anonymizer, a company based
in La Mesa, Calif., offers a free eponymous product and a beefed-up
version for $14.99 per three months. Anonymizer is entirely
Web-based, meaning there's no software to download; users surf to
sites through the Anonymizer site, which masks their identity and
deflects any cookies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Freedom, from Zero-Knowledge Systems (www.zeroknowledge.com):
Zero-Knowledge is a Canadian company whose flagship product is
still in beta-testing mode, with a $49.95 version due out next
month. Freedom is software that sits on the user's computer and
sets up a pseudonym for Web surfing, e-mail, newsgroup posting,
file downloading and many other online activities. Zero-Knowledge
also supplies encryption software for Freedom users to many small
to midsize Internet service providers, for extra security.
</P>
<P>
   -- Junkbuster (www.junkbusters.com): Junkbuster software sits on
a user's computer, and works between the browser and the Internet,
throwing out cookies and other information that the user doesn't
want revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these firms also maintain comprehensive Web sites
referring users to other products, resource guides, more Web sites
and books on privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Lumeria, a Berkeley, Calif., company, has a similar product in
the works. Lumeria's Super Profile will be an ``infomediary,''
which lets users selectively sell information about themselves to
marketers and guard their privacy at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Davis, Lumeria's CEO, said Super Profile will let users
decide which cookies to keep in a ``cookie jar,'' and it will give
a fake IP address and fake information about surfing habits to Web
sites that try to place unwanted cookies. Davis called the tactic
``Cookie Doe,'' and he likened it to ``a bulimic agent that tosses
its cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy protection software is not yet big business. Junkbusters
Corp. gives the software away, which helps promote the company's
consulting business. Privada and Zero-Knowledge want to make money
by selling their products, but the software is still in beta and
not yet commercially available for downloading. (Privada is for
sale on CD only, with the download coming soon.) Even so, Privada
CEO Barbara Bellissimo reports 70,000 visitors to her site in the
first month.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymizer CEO Lance Cottrell hopes that by giving away a
limited version of his product, users will want to buy a more
comprehensive version. He said 100,000 people use the free version
of his product, while less than 10,000 people have bought the
enhanced version.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tiny, tiny fraction of the potential market size,''
Cottrell said. ``People are just becoming aware of these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time a security flaw is exposed in Microsoft software, he
said, or Amazon.com reveals what employees at various companies are
buying, people's awareness of the power of online data collection
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to control their personal information on the
Web,'' said Privada's Bellissimo. ``There's a segment of people on
the Internet who don't know what can be obtained without their
knowledge, but there's a huge segment that aren't even on the
Internet because of their fear of losing their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington, D.C.,
organization that advocates for civil liberties in the digital age,
maintains a Web site that offers a glimpse of the kinds of
information Web sites can gather on surfers. Click on the word
``You'' at snoop.cdt.org, and you'll see your IP address (which
could give a potential hacker a head-start on finding out who you
are and what you're doing online), the type of browser and
operating system you're using, and other information such as your
Internet ``host'' and your e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Often, people simply give away information about themselves,
unaware that it can be combined with this other technical data to
form a powerful market research tool.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you sign up for one of the privacy enhancement
services, you have to trust that company.
</P>
<P>
   Privada said it can't tell who's doing what using its service,
but it does know who has signed up. If a law enforcement agency
brings a subpoena, Privada can install a ``monitor'' so it could
track a user's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge's Smith said his company's name speaks to its
commitment to users: ``We don't know anything about you, and we
never want to.''
</P>
<P>
   More than mere technology, protection of privacy will also
require government's passing new laws, as well as self-regulation
by Internet companies and users.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single technology can solve all the problems,'' said Ari
Schwartz, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and
Technology. ``And on a global medium like the Internet, no
technological solution can work on its own without some sort of
policy.''

ASHLEY JUDD PUTS HER MOVIE CAREER IN `JEOPARDY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashley Judd needs a new agent _ and quick.
</P>
<P>
   Stardom for the sister of Wynonna and daughter of Naomi has been
predicted for years, ever since her memorable portrayal of a young
woman trying to make her way in a hard world in ``Ruby in
Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Put Judd in a dress, and she's the most beautiful woman on
Earth; put her in jeans and a T-shirt, and she's the sweet young
lady next door. Either way, she has this no-nonsense-but-tender
presence; we sense that she won't settle for less than she
deserves, won't give up without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   And it's that mixture of toughness and sexiness that, along with
a strong turn as a woman who escapes a perverted serial kidnapper
in 1997's not-scary-enough ``Kiss the Girls,'' that has
anticipation so high for ``Double Jeopardy.'' She and Tommy Lee
Jones share above-the-title billing, but this is cleary Judd's shot
at stardom.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she gets another: ``Double'' is a film lousy with
telegraphed plot twists, moments borrowed from other movies, and
cliched characters _ and, oh yeah, yet another chance for Jones to
play Mr. Tough Guy. Like we haven't seen that a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Judd plays Libby Parsons, the wife of egomaniacal rich guy Nick
(a bland Bruce Greenwood); the two go sailing on a boat he's about
to buy her, and she wakes up covered with blood _ with bloody
footprints indicating that ol' Nick cut himself up and jumped into
the water.
</P>
<P>
   She's convicted of his murder and sent to prison, where she
learns that A) Nick is alive and living with her son, Matty, and
her supposed best friend, Angie (a wooden Annabeth Gish), and B)
the double jeopardy rule: A person can't be convicted twice for the
same crime, so she's free to off ol' Nick when she's sprung.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is about as suspenseful as watching concrete
harden _ Libby follows Nick's trail from San Francisco to Colorado
to New Orleans, with Jones (clearly slumming here _ how bad does he
need money?) dogging her trail and losing her several times.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the trailer basically gives away the
entire movie, beginning to end. But that aside, anybody older than,
say, 5 could guess what will happen next. And next. And next.
</P>
<P>
   Judd does the best she can, under these dire circumstances;
she's a presence, no doubt about it, and the big screen loves her.
She deftly maneuvers Libby's moments of bewilderment, determination
and terror _ the part is all about just not giving up, and she
finds a home in it.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are a few interesting twists: Much of the plot
revolves around a piece of artwork by European modernist Wassily
Kandinsky, and there's a nice reference to ``The Vanishing'' in the
film's last third.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, these touches do not a good, suspenseful film
make, and ``Jeopardy'' sinks into a paint-by-the-numbers female
revenge fantasy. Judd clearly deserves better _ and after this film
bombs (as it deserves to) one hopes that she might get better
material and better co-stars. Then we might really see something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' is rated R for violence, brief partial
nudity, language and a particularly bloody crime scene.

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided in
Vienna Wednesday to continue cutting production of crude oil, a
move expected to insure high prices for crude and high retail
prices for gasoline and heating oil this winter.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day meeting, the 11 OPEC ministers said in a
statement that their countries would maintain production cuts
through March 2000 and then decide on further action. The price of
crude oil has more than doubled since the cuts were first put into
effect last March, going from a low of $11 early this year to
nearly $24 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in prices, which the production cutbacks are intended
to continue, has had a ripple effect on a broad range of petroleum
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for gasoline have risen more than 25 percent and are not
dropping despite the end of the heavy summer driving season, which
usually ushers in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price of home heating oil is expected to begin rising
shortly, as demand begins to kick in with cooler weather. The
Energy Department estimates that home heating oil will cost
consumers about 30 percent more than last year, on average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer will get socked big time,''said Fred Leuffer, an
oil analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC countries suffered a huge loss of revenue because of a
plunge in crude oil prices last year. The cutbacks by OPEC, as well
as by other major producers like Mexico and Norway, could send
prices for crude and refined products even higher in the months
ahead, some analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices of petroleum products in this country have been
going up for months. The average price of self-serve regular
gasoline rose to $1.268 a gallon this week, up 1.8 cents from a
week ago, according to a survey of 800 gasoline stations made by
the Energy Department. A year ago, prices were about $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Energy Information Administration projects that
the price will average $1.24 for regular gasoline in the first
quarter of next year, compared with 95 cents in the first quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also expects that heating oil, which averaged about
80 cents a gallon last winter, will cost an average of about $1.04
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Although natural gas is not directly affected by OPEC, prices
have also risen substantially this year, until recently, and are
also expected to be much higher this winter than last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With demand rising, the supply of natural gas has not increased
significantly because of a major slowdown in drilling that began
last year, when many companies cut back on spending because of
falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual show of unity, OPEC has held firm since March when
it put in cuts that reduced oil production by about 4.3 million
barrels a day from the levels of February.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of non-OPEC members, including Mexico and
Norway, which in the past kept pumping all they could while OPEC
held back, the major oil producing nations have been able to
largely eliminate a glut of oil that built up last year and caused
prices to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with an economic recovery in Asia and strong demand
elsewhere, the cuts have led to a sustained resurgence in the price
of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Leuffer and other analysts said, crude could
go much higher, perhaps to $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   They said, however, that some of the world's largest producers
such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela would then increase production
for fear of cooling demand and undermining the world's major
economies, most of which are heavily dependent on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep the cuts in place comes at a time when
inventories have been dropping and demand continues to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris and
tracks world energy trends, predicted this month that demand for
crude oil would grow by 2.5 percent next year, which would be the
largest annual increase since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that consumption would total 77.1 million
barrels a day next year, compared with 75.2 million barrels a day
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Edgard Habib, a Middle East specialist with the agency, said
that OPEC must be careful not to let the price go too high because
it could stifle the Asian recovery. In the end, he said, if prices
go high enough, this would stimulate production of non-OPEC oil.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that tensions continue within OPEC, the
organization failed Wednesday to agree on a new secretary-general,
and the incumbent, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, will extend his term
at least until next March's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that OPEC will have to ease up on its
cutbacks and actually increase production next year to prevent a
huge run-up in price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things look awfully tight,'' Leuffer said. ``In order to
balance the market, OPEC will have to increase production
substantially, by more than 2.5 million barrels a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But for this winter, at least, there seems little relief in
sight for consumers who enjoyed unusually low energy prices last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Costello, an International Energy Agency economist, said
that for the short term, ``the fundamentals will keep an upward
pressure on prices.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The consumer will be paying more for goods related
to petroleum.'' &QL;

People concerned about online privacy can take matters into their
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Davis, CEO of Lumeria, offered some tips for protecting
privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   You can go into your browser's preferences file and turn off
cookies, but you soon will discover just how many sites require
that you accept a cookie. Plus, privacy advocates note, there are
cookies that users want to accept, such as those that remember a
password and save users the trouble of retyping it each time they
visit a site.
</P>
<P>
   Davis recommends that you never give your true identity when
signing up for something online. &UR;  &LR; If you're an old man in Northern
California, perhaps you want to sign up as a young woman in
Seattle. (But be careful: I gave a bogus ZIP code when I signed up
for a free Internet fax service and wound up with a number in the
wrong area code. When I tried to sign up again, the service
wouldn't let me _ it had placed a cookie on my browser and knew I
was back for more.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Another way to mask your identity is to set up free e-mail
accounts, like those available at a portal site (such as Yahoo or
Excite) or at Hotmail, and use them in identifying yourself around
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is concerned, and yet they still go around the Net
and fill out the correct information on forms,'' Davis said,
shaking his head in disbelief. ``People are honest.''

 &HT;    Woods seeking a Spain painkiller
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It remains the only blemish on his
professional resume.
</P>
<P>
   Since turning professional three years ago, Tiger Woods has won
two majors and 12 PGA Tour titles, made almost $9 million in
official earnings while helping purses double and _ breath, please
_ increased the number of minorities who play or watch the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But he's never won a Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' only previous Ryder Cup experience was a disaster in
1997, as the world's No.1-ranked player went 1-3-1 for the losing
American team at Valderrama. It was no coincidence that Sports
Illustrated made him its cover boy with the inscription, ``The Pain
In Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods gets a chance to ease that memory this week as he's
expected to lead the favored American team to victory in the 33rd
Ryder Cup matches at The Country Club. His critics will point out
he also was expected to do the same in 1997, but Woods knew better.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been just five months since his record-setting
victory at the Masters, but Woods was in the middle of changing his
swing and he knew he wasn't going to Valderrama with his so-called
``A-game.'' Despite possessing one of the best match-play records
as an amateur _ he was a combined 42-3 while winning a trio of U.S.
Amateurs and U.S. Junior Amateur championships _ Woods wasn't
surprised he struggled in Spain, even losing to Costantino Rocca in
singles 4-and-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '97, I wasn't playing very well from the Western (Open) on,
and unfortunately it carried over into the Ryder Cup,'' Woods said.
``But this year I'm coming into the tournament with more of a
positive attitude and rightfully so. I've played well this
summer.'' Woods has won five of his past eight tournaments,
including the PGA Championship and the NEC Invitational against
stellar fields. Throw out his 37th-place finish at the Sprint
International because it came one week after his exhausting victory
at Medinah, and Woods has finished in the top 10 in his past seven
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger at this moment is playing some of the best golf of his
young career,'' U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said. ``He has a very
strong mind to play this game at the highest level. And he's a
very, very smooth engine right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's counterpart, European captain Mark James, was more
praising. ``Tiger's obviously the dominant figure in the game at
the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European team can take solace only by knowing that Woods, as
brilliant as he's been playing, cannot win the Ryder Cup by
himself. ``All one player can do is win five points,'' says
Europe's Colin Montgomerie, ``and it takes 14 1/2 to win.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Woods' presence alone seems to give the Americans a
decided advantage. And not just with his length on a course, where
he can drive two of the par-4s. There's also the psychological edge
he can provide teammates with his dominant play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he goes out there and plays the way he's capable, then
that's going to be a big advantage for us,'' Jim Furyk said. ``That
in itself could probably bring the rest of us up to a better
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believed Woods failed to own up to his leadership role at
Valderrama, but he insists he simply was acting his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were criticizing me for not being a vocal leader. Well,
I was 21 years old and playing in my first Ryder Cup,'' Woods said.
``It's like saying Sergio (Garcia) needs to be the leader of the
(European) team when he's got some players who have been around 20
years. That would be doing them an injustice and not giving them
the respect they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Woods no longer calls the Ryder Cup an ``exhibition,''
he refuses to overstate the importance of what happens this
weekend. He says he's going to try his hardest to finally put his
hands on the gold chalice, but he won't let a defeat ruin his
record run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's going to make or break your career,'' he
said. ``If we lose the Ryder Cup, I don't think I'm going to look
back and say it's a bad year. I've won six times this year. It's
been a pretty good year.''
</P>
<P>
   And it will become even better if that blemish gets removed.

 AIRING REAL NEWS IN ASIA A RISKY BUSINESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Broadcasting real news into countries with heavy censorship has
never been easy. But Radio Free Asia, an entity established by
Congress in 1996, can do more than just try to beat the
authorities' signal-scramblers.
</P>
<P>
   It puts its news on the Web, at www.rfa.org.
</P>
<P>
   The private, nonprofit corporation _ which still gets all of its
funding from Congress _ seeks to put objective news on the air and
on the Web, into places like China, Laos, Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia
and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in addition to scrambling the radio signals,
governments in those countries try to stifle access to the Web
site, and to the Internet in general. But that's a trickier task
because Asian countries also want to use the Internet to boost
their own economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of the Chinese government toward the Internet has
been defensive,'' said Zhang Weiguo, a visiting scholar at the
Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at
Berkeley and a contributor to Radio Free Asia. In an e-mail
interview conducted through an interpreter, he explained, ``They
hope to benefit from the Internet economically, but at the same
time, they don't want to lose control politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiguo said Internet use is growing fast in China; although
experts predicted there would be 1.2 million accounts this year
(with each account likely to have multiple users), actual tallies
show more than 4 million accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has made it possible for the Chinese people to
have one more way to communicate with the outside world,'' he said.
``With the Internet, they inform the rest of the world what's
really happening inside China, and they can also find out what's
happening outside China.''
</P>
<P>
   That's essentially the Radio Free Asia model in all the
countries it covers. Pat Lute, a spokeswoman for the Washington,
D.C., service, was in San Francisco last week touting RFA's network
of correspondents who risk their lives to break news.
</P>
<P>
   She described correspondents in Changmai, Thailand, who
interview Burmese refugees as soon as they cross the border,
bringing news of that closed society.
</P>
<P>
   Lute warned people not to confuse RFA with Voice of America,
which still pumps U.S. propaganda around the world in English.
Radio Free Asia uses only native speakers and tries to provide its
audience with objective journalism.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade this
spring, RFA's Web site hosted a lively debate over whether the
action was deliberate or accidental. One person accused everyone at
RFA of being spies for the United States, but Lute said such
postings proved its independence. ``It was exactly what democracy
is about,'' she said, ``a free and open exchange of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   IN FAVOR OF JUNKETS: Leave it to John C. Dvorak, the
curmudgeonly dean of trade-publication tech journalists, to spark a
debate on what looks like a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak's contrarian take: Why not let reporters take junkets
from tech companies?
</P>
<P>
   The question seems as easy to answer as why not allow payola. If
a journalist lets a company pay the way for, say, an overseas trip,
won't that somehow color the news coverage? Won't it damage the
hard-earned credibility of news organizations if they let the
companies they cover take them on tours, and wine and dine them?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy can't go on a junket, he's at an immediate
disadvantage,'' Dvorak says. ``It's a false ethic to protect large
publishing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak speaks as a free-lancer, albeit a very successful one. He
writes columns for PC Magazine, PC Computing and some smaller mags
and hosts ``Silicon Spin'' on ZDTV as well as a syndicated radio
show.
</P>
<P>
   He says the big companies can afford to send their reporters far
and wide, while smaller publications and writers like him can't
afford to travel as extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is doing something in Korea and they want me to
see it, they should pay for it,'' he says. ``Why should I pay to go
see their dog and pony show?''
</P>
<P>
   But what if he thinks their products are terrible? Could he rip
them in print? ``I've done it,'' he says. ``It's fair to the
reader, as long as you let the reader know these guys paid for the
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   European journalists take junkets as a matter of course, he
said. Everyone there does it, and everyone knows, so there's no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak's been on junkets to Asia, to Finland and, earlier this
year, to the Hannover Fair in Germany. ``That was a nice junket,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   A company named APC, which makes power supplies, took him to the
massive German trade show in April, and he found it ``very
educational to go on the coattails of a company that knows the
ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, you can probably hear editors grinding their teeth at
Dvorak's heretical stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just astonished,'' says Tim Graham, president of the
Northern California chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists, and the editor of TechWeek. ``It's very disturbing to
hear him think it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPJ policy, which is online at www.spj.org/ethics/code.htm,
is clear: No free trips or any other actions that compromise
journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Graham says, many newsrooms took all sorts of
freebies, Christmas gifts and junkets. But after Watergate, ``most
newsrooms cleaned up their act, and established a we-pay-your-way
policy. It's become accepted practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Chase, an assistant professor and director of technology at
the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, helps
run the Computer Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I let a company fly me first class over to Asia and put me
up in a fancy hotel and show me a product, I'm going to be more
favorably inclined to it than if I saw it in a friend's basement,''
Chase says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism is never cheap,'' he notes. ``If you want to do an
objective job, you have to spend a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase says reporters need to ask two questions: ``One is, are
you doing anything that is affecting your ability to report
objectively? And the second, and more important, are you doing
anything that would affect the perception that you're objective?''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of a conflict, as we've learned in politics, is
often just as important as a real conflict.
</P>
<P>
   John Markoff, a New York Times technology reporter based in San
Francisco, loves to hear about his friend Dvorak's trips but never
takes similar opportunities even though they crop up all the time.
``Last week, I was invited to Singapore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking funding to go places or to travel to corporate events
crosses the line pretty clearly,'' he says. ``I would feel very
uncomfortable.'' This week, Markoff hit the road to Seattle for
Microsoft's ``MSN Strategy Day,'' but the Times is paying his way.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the junkets Dvorak describes ``might be fun, but they
have little to do with news gathering,'' Markoff says. ``They wine
you, they dine you and show you products in a controlled manner.
Those are the kind of events I try to avoid.''

 2 NET ENTREPRENEURS MAKING NOISE OVER MTV DEAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Two young Internet entrepreneurs from San Francisco, who are
embroiled in a legal battle with MTV Networks, say MTV bought their
business and then tried to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Rotem Perelmutter, 27, and Michael Briseno, 28, last year
founded Imagine Radio, which built customized radio stations on the
Internet. They sold it to MTV for $14.5 million in February. But
the deal started to sour almost immediately, and now the two are
fighting one of the largest media companies in the world, MTV's
parent, Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   The men's lawyers say the cable powerhouse subverted their
original business and now is banning them from working in Internet
radio for a year because MTV fears the impact of Internet radio on
its franchise business of showing music videos on television.
</P>
<P>
   MTV declined to comment on the case, but in court filings, it
accused Perelmutter _ who had already received more than $3 million
of his $6.6 million take in the deal _ of ``scheming to replicate
the business he had just sold to MTV (Networks) in the hope of
selling it again to others for an even higher amount.'' It said
Briseno was part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The case sheds light on the way deals get done in the
high-stakes world of the Internet. An affidavit filed by
Perelmutter tells of being alternately ``threatened and cajoled''
and wined and dined by MTV executives eager to buy his small firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made every effort to `wow' me, and they succeeded,'' he
said in the affidavit. ``We attended dinner at Nobu, a very
fashionable sushi restaurant (in Manhattan). We were surrounded by
famous people, including Calvin Klein, Cindy Crawford and Donald
Trump. ... (then-President and Chief Operating Officer of MTV
Networks Mark Rosenthal) held out his hands and pointed his fingers
like guns, stating to me, `You the man' and `Rotem, it's all about
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to affidavits, Perelmutter and Briseno were friends as
undergraduates at the University of California at Los Angeles, and
in 1997 founded an Internet radio company in Perelmutter's
apartment in San Francisco. Perelmutter, an Israeli native, was the
financial brains, and brought $50,000 of his life savings; Briseno
represented the technical side of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling firm, Silver Island, sought to help people build
customized radio stations on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the entrepreneurs began to run out of money in
mid-1998, they received funding from computer magazine publisher
Imagine Media of Brisbane, Calif., and changed the name to Imagine
Radio. Imagine Media and Perelmutter were the primary owners of the
new company.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, MTV began wooing the company, and the
deal closed in February. MTV planned to use Imagine Radio
technology for a project now known as Sonic Net, which would stream
radiolike content over the Internet so users could in effect create
their own station.
</P>
<P>
   But Briseno and Perelmutter were frustrated almost immediately,
and say they spoke to MTV about leaving. They planned to create a
new business that would serve MTV and other Internet radio
companies.
</P>
<P>
   MTV now denies knowledge of the new business and charges the men
with plotting to compete with Sonic Net.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perelmutter and Briseno acknowledge that they signed
contracts in which they agreed not to compete with MTV for certain
periods after they leave, they say they signed those without the
benefit of counsel and with MTV's assurance that it would not
enforce the claims. Briseno also says the prohibition is not
enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   MTV took the pair to New York state court this month, trying to
put a stop to their new business, but a judge refused to grant a
temporary restraining order. MTV is now trying to move the case to
federal court. It wants to keep Perelmutter and Briseno from
working in the Internet radio business until February 2000 and
February 2001, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Briseno's attorney, Dale Lysak of the Dzivi Law Firm in San
Francisco, says MTV is ``judge-shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The state court judge has set a conference date for late
October.

TAIWAN QUAKE TO BE COSTLY TO WORLD TECHNOLOGY MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Industrial disruption from Taiwan's devastating
earthquake could delay or reduce the production of high-technology
items ranging from cellular phones to Furby dolls _ affecting far
more than just the computer semiconductors that Taiwan manufactures
in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   As electronics and computer companies everywhere sought to
assess how badly the quake would affect them, it also became clear
Wednesday that power failures on Taiwan could worsen or prolong
operating problems there, even at installations that suffered
little or no structural damage. By some estimates, it will take at
least two weeks to restore power to industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is the world's fourth-largest maker of semiconductors and
the third largest of personal computers. Most of its products go
into big-name brands all over the world, including IBM, Motorola
and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts said that it was premature to
assign a firm cost to the quake but that it was likely to be high.
Taiwan authorities are giving initial estimates of more than $3
billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate and obvious impact on international business from
the earthquake that struck on Tuesday was on semiconductor makers,
which supply the chips that are the brains of personal computers.
The stock prices of producers that rely on Taiwan's chip foundries,
such as Motorola and National Semiconductor, have been dropping,
while those of rival manufacturers that obtain chips elsewhere,
like in South Korea, have been rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest blow in the history of the semiconductor
industry,'' said Hiroshi Yoshihara, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But more than the supply of semiconductors has been affected.
High-technology manufacturers buy the main personal computer
circuits known as motherboards, as well as monitors, liquid-crystal
displays and even batteries and chargers, from companies in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies make notebook computers for Fujitsu, NEC and
Apple Computer, among others. Compaq shops in Taiwan for hard-disk
drives. Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard buy computer modems
there. Toy makers like Mattel and the Bandai Co. of Japan also buy
equipment from Taiwan. All in all, Taiwan exports at least $12
billion in high-technology goods to foreign manufacturers a year.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake struck the center of the island, well away from
the main concentration of factories in the north, and most of those
appear to have avoided major damage. Taiwan Semiconductor, with the
world's biggest chip foundry, said its installation had withstood
the quake and that it would lose no more than 10 percent of its
production this month.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Wednesday that the big problem facing
producers in Taiwan was not structural damage, but the absence of
electricity. ``The most serious impact is power,'' said C.M.
Chiang, managing director of International Data's Taiwan office.
</P>
<P>
   ``From initial reports so far, it seems that most of the
factories of our supplier are intact,'' said Cecilia Pang, a
spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard in Singapore. ``The problem is the
power outage. They can have the factory running, but without power
they can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides power failures, analysts saw minor structural damage as
posing a problem. ``The biggest impact is on the semiconductor
industry, because of its complexity,'' said William Milton of Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The circuits in Wednesday's semiconductors are one-400th the
thickness of a strand of hair, so the equipment needed to make them
is extremely delicate. Even if such equipment was not damaged, it
would require extensive testing and recalibration before it could
be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, chips take up to 60 days to produce, and Yoshihara
said any chips that were in production at the time of the quake
would probably have to be discarded. A one-day power loss late in
July cost the Taiwan chip industry millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, an effect of Tuesday's earthquake could be to
inflate further the prices of memory chips, which have been rising
because demand is outstripping supply. The price of the most
popular 64-megabit memory chip has more than tripled since July.
After news of the quake, the average price jumped nearly 12
percent, according to the American IC Exchange, an electronic
pricing service for chips in Aliso Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Production delays could also be bad news for companies that
depend on Taiwan for ``logic chips,'' the more complex
semiconductors used to run cellular phones and that give toys like
the Furby their talents. Also vulnerable, Milton said, are such
small concerns as Xilinx Inc., which designs chips and then
contracts with companies in Taiwan to produce them. Xilinx issued a
statement saying it did not expect to be hurt by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was possible that larger companies and the
electronics industry as a whole could be insulated against Taiwan's
problems. Even though many chips are made on the island, the output
still accounts for only about 15 percent of global memory-chip
production, compared with 34 percent by South Korea. And as with
other components, most big manufacturers buy parts from several
countries. NEC, for example, buys parts for its PC's from China and
the Philippines, as well as Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, executives said it would take time to shift purchases
to other suppliers or even to determine just how much their
supplies from Taiwan would be affected. As Motorola shipped in
radio equipment for rescuers, an executive said he was trying to
track down a shipment of batteries for the company's cellular
phones.

 STRUGGLING PACIFIC BANK OKS SALE TO CITY NATIONAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By SAM ZUCKERMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Bank, a once-high-flying San Francisco
commercial lender that fell from grace during California's real
estate crash at the beginning of the decade, agreed to sell itself
Wednesday to City National Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., for $153
million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover, which must be approved by regulators and
shareholders, will give fast-growing City National its first
foothold in Northern California. With $6.7 billion in assets, City
National is the largest community bank headquartered in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific, with $728 million in assets, has four branches in San
Francisco and Burlingame, Calif.; five branches in the Los Angeles
area; and offices in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have the same mix of businesses, including trust,
international finance, and banking services for wealthy individuals
and small to midsize businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business profiles are very similar,'' said Michael Tun
Zan, Pacific's Burma-born president and chief executive. ``We will
be the springboard for their expansion in the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific has been through rocky times in recent years after
nearly failing when its large portfolio of commercial real estate
loans produced big losses in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, its ties to Asia produced a multimillion-dollar loss
in the fourth quarter after several Hong Kong customers defaulted
on loans.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Pacific was hamstrung in finding a buyer because
a Singapore shareholder who owned a 37 percent stake in the bank
refused to take stock in exchange for her shares. Last year, she
sold her shares in a public offering, freeing Pacific to pursue a
sale of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   City National has long been one of the highest-profile
independent banks in the state. Known as ``the bank of the stars,''
it built a strong business with Hollywood insiders. CEO Russell
Goldsmith, son of City National's previous chief, headed Republic
Pictures Corp. before he moved to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its glitzy reputation, much of City National's business
has been in the more gritty world of companies in such areas as
apparel and import-export. Since Russell Goldsmith took over as CEO
four years ago, City National has bought seven Southern California
banks and one trust company.
</P>
<P>
   After the purchase is complete, Tun Zan will stay on as City
National's senior officer in Northern California, Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank expects to shut several overlapping branches in the Los
Angeles area but doesn't expect to close offices in Northern
California, Goldsmith said.

   COLUMBUS JUNCTION, Iowa _ On a hillside that rises above a
middle-American vista of shoulder-high corn, red barns and shiny
silos sits St. Joseph the Worker Roman Catholic Church, a place
whose recent inner changes reflect those emerging in the wider
American religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The parish was founded more than a century ago for the northern
European immigrants arriving in the fertile lands of southeastern
Iowa. Their descendants still worship at St. Joseph. But an hour
after they have left an early morning Mass, the little church is
crowded again, this time with worshipers from a more recent wave of
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   To a casual observer, much looks the same _ just another group,
families and couples, dressed in jeans and work shirts, a few women
in skirts and blouses. But then Mass begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Weir, born and reared in Iowa, begins the
liturgy with a phrase deeply familiar to those standing before him,
many from Mexico or southern Texas. ``En el nombre del Padre y del
Hijo y del Espiritu Santo,'' the 44-year-old priest says, in an
American-accented Spanish that he has worked hard to learn since he
arrived in this tiny city _ ``in the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   His congregation responds with an amen and embarks on a series
of Spanish-language hymns, accompanied by a guitarist who stands
near a portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the symbol of Mexican
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   As the scene suggests, the life of organized religion in the
United States has been growing more diverse than it was two or
three decades ago, and not just in traditional immigrant gateways
like New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, but in many small
places in between.
</P>
<P>
   The change that has captured the most attention has been brought
by the visible communities of Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus, who
have built mosques and temples in cities, suburbs and rural areas.
But equally important is the impact of large numbers of Christians,
from Latin America, Asia and Africa, where the faith has been
growing.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are having a profound impact on Christian
communities, from Catholics to mainline Protestants, evangelicals
and Pentecostals. Some Catholic bishops are asking their priests to
learn a second language, often Spanish. Protestant denominations
have stepped up efforts to create non-English-speaking
congregations or try to bring immigrant-led churches into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, houses of worship are becoming multilingual zones. A
single church building may have a Spanish-speaking congregation on
Sunday morning at 8, an English-speaking congregation at 10, a
Korean-speaking congregation at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and a
Vietnamese group in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parishes in the Episcopal Church's Diocese of New
York, significant growth has come in the Bronx, among Latin
American, African and Caribbean immigrants. Archdeacon Michael S.
Kendall said that within the diocese, ``every Sunday, we celebrate
in 14 languages.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, Calif., many United Methodist congregations
advertise services in Cambodian, Samoan or Tongan. A service in
their own tongue can be highly attractive to many immigrants
because it is the language in which they learned to pray, an
intimate act.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Presbyterian Church (USA) has increased its
Korean-language congregations to 350 from 20 over the last three
decades, even though its total membership has declined.
</P>
<P>
   But it is within the Catholic Church, with 61 million baptized
members, that recent immigration has been most strongly felt.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Diocese of Davenport, which encompasses southeastern
Iowa, some say the change is pushing the church to recognize that
it is once again becoming an immigrant church, an identity it
largely lost after the election of President John F. Kennedy, the
nation's first Catholic president.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the first wave of Catholic immigrants came mainly from
Europe, the newer influx is more diverse, coming from East Asia,
the Caribbean and, especially, Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But Hispanic Catholics are far from a monolithic presence in the
church, encompassing people who trace their backgrounds to 23
nations, according to the U.S. Catholic Conference. Many have lived
in the United States for generations, some tracing their roots to
the Spanish settlers in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The presence of immigrants, Hispanic and others, has spread far
and wide, rippling out to the Southeast and the Midwest _ to places
like Columbus Junction, whose population is less than 2,000 _ where
such groups went largely unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all are Catholics. David Seeley, the new,
bilingual pastor of the Free Methodist Church nearby, said he was
attracted to this area because it gave him an opportunity to add a
Spanish-language congregation to his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get a Hispanic congregation, then I will have
considered myself to have failed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Mexican or Mexican-American families settled in
Louisa County, which includes Columbus Junction, in the 1960s after
having worked here as migrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seems certain how many new families from Mexico,
Central America and the Texas border have arrived over the last
decade in Columbus Junction, a town overlooking the confluence of
the Cedar and Iowa Rivers, to work in meat-packing operations or
nearby factories. Mike Braun, who owns a hog farm outside town and
is serving his second term on the school board, said a majority of
students in the lower elementary grades are Hispanic children.

FILM SPOTLIGHTS MEXICAN WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mexican War of the 1840s wasn't fought solely by Mexicans
and Americans. The sons of Irish immigrants, fleeing the potato
famine, joined the U.S. Army with the promise of citizenship and
land for their families. The historical drama ``One Man's Hero'' is
about a group of those Irish soldiers who, after suffering
persecution for their Catholic beliefs, deserted and eventually
wound up fighting for the Mexican side _ and became Mexican heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Berenger plays Sgt. John Riley, the leader of the Irish
troops, who deserts his post with a group of young soldiers after
saving them from lashings by their martinet commander (Stephen
Tobolowsky, in a thankless, one-dimensional role); they were being
punished for crossing the border to attend Catholic Mass. Riley
takes the men to Mexico, where they're captured by
</P>
<P>
   guerrillas fighting the Mexican government. But it's the
government that ultimately offers Riley and his men a choice: fight
for Mexico and earn land to settle on, or die. Riley chooses to
fight, and his rag-tag band becomes known as St. Patrick's
Battalion _ or Los San Patricios.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' is one of those frustrating movies that are
better than they could have been and not as good as they should
have been. That sounds oxymoronic, but both sides of the argument
are based in the movie's low budget (director Lance Hool struggled
for two decades to get the movie made, and even now it's getting a
haphazard, underpromoted release).
</P>
<P>
   With Berenger at the fore, struggling with an Irish accent,
``One Man's Hero'' resembles one of those historic dramas made for
TNT _ at least till the second half, when the battle scenes hit
high gear. Berenger is earnest, though, as is the movie; it's so
intent on educating you that it sometimes feels like an unusually
well-done high-school history-class film.
</P>
<P>
   But if the movie had had more financial backing, it really could
have been something. One wonders what someone like Steven Spielberg
could have done with this story, especially after Spielberg made
his fascination with history evident with ``Amistad'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mexican War has to be one of the most ignored
subjects of the past 30 or 40 years, almost to the point that
anything on the subject would be welcome. And the movie provides
good parts for multifaceted Mexican star Daniela Romo (as a nurse
who becomes Riley's love interest) and character actor Joaquim de
Almeida (''Clear and Present Danger''), who gives the film's best
performance as the conflicted rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' isn't interested in being objective, although
it is fair enough to mention that not all Americans were in favor
of the war. And in the movies, where fiction almost always corrupts
fact, history must be taken with a grain of salt. ``One Man's
Hero'' will have as much of an uphill battle at the box office as
its protoganists had in war, but it will probably send those who
see it scrambling to the Internet or the library to find out more
about its subject. And that, really, is all the filmmakers could
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' is rated R for violence.

 COLUMBUS JUNCTION, Iowa: Hispanic children.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants tend to be younger than longtime Columbus
Junction residents, and many have recently started families. Over
the past seven years, Weir has found he does more baptisms of
infants from Mexican or Mexican-American families than of babies
from non-Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the immigrants share apartments or have rented trailers.
But others have bought houses and started businesses _ grocery
stores, bakeries and bars _ in the town's pocket-sized business
district. Proprietors keep late hours, luring people back to
sidewalks once empty in the evenings, said Earlene Lekwa, the mayor
of Columbus Junction, who was elected two years ago after
campaigning door-to-door among Hispanic and non-Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parishioners of St. Joseph's Church, Humberto
Hernandez, a baker's son, moved to Houston from Mexico in 1985,
then came here to work at a large meat-packing plant, which opened
in the late 1980s. ``In Texas there are a lot of jobs, but they
don't pay much,'' he said. After a decade, he and his wife, Maria,
opened a convenience store in nearby Conesville, a tiny town
surrounded by melon fields.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic and non-Hispanic communities mix little, by the
account of people in both groups. They say language keeps them
apart, as do different working schedules, especially with some at
the meat-packing plant working on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you might see a little bit of it in the summer,'' with
families getting together around Little League games, said Ms.
Lekwa, the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But church is a more adult experience, which makes mixing more
difficult. When the Diocese of Davenport assigned Weir here on July
4, 1991, his goal was to bring the two communities closer.
</P>
<P>
   An extrovert with close-cropped hair and a goatee, he initially
relied on a bilingual adolescent to translate at the
Spanish-language Mass. But the next year he was given a sabbatical
to learn the language, studying in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The experience went badly, Weir said, the result of ``horrid
culture shock.'' He found he could not get waited on in restaurants
and, in a couple of confusing encounters, had people swear at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't speak the language, couldn't find my way around,''
Weir said. ``And so I found myself very much isolated, because I
didn't have any kind of social support.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience also awakened within him a profound empathy
for immigrants. ``I learned what it was like to be a foreigner and
discriminated against,'' he said. ``And that was much more
important than the Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Weir returned to St. Joseph's, he decided the church would
be unlocked 24 hours a day as a gesture of welcome. That happened
after an immigrant got stranded without a ride one winter evening,
tried to get into the church to get warm and found it shut.
</P>
<P>
   The incident showed that many immigrants looked to the parish
and its priest for services that longtime residents did not need.
</P>
<P>
   While Weir's non-Hispanic parishioners expected him to be there
to celebrate Mass and to baptize, marry, counsel and bury them, the
new immigrants wanted more from him. He was called upon to help
them find jobs, housing, furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people arrive with absolutely nothing,'' Weir said,
``and need all the services, need clothes, need food, need help
registering at school.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir grew up in Albia, a town of fewer than 4,000 people about
60 miles southeast of Des Moines. He was the second of seven
children; his father was an appliance repairman, his mother a
tailor. His father's family came from Scotland and his mother's
from Ireland, but the most recent immigrants on either side arrived
five generations ago, by Weir's estimate. ``I grew up very white,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his ministry has changed him. ``My heart is not as white as
the way I grew up.'' And that, he added, ``puts me sometimes in a
strange position, of not fitting into either culture.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Getting to know a community, especially one made up of people
who have uprooted themselves, takes ``a lot more than getting the
language,'' Weir said, adding that a priest must also try ``to
figure out some of the cultural elements,'' which can be picked up
at events like games and parties.
</P>
<P>
   By paying such close attention to his Hispanic parishioners,
Weir has triggered some grumbling among his English-speaking
parishioners. They have been reluctant to discuss their discontent
with an outsider, although one couple, speaking privately, have
said they objected to having a Spanish-language Mass on the ground
that everyone should learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that sentiment appears reflected in a move in Iowa to
make English the official language for county business. It is under
consideration locally, and Weir attended a public meeting to speak
against it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, his goal is church unity, to forge a single
parish, ``one people under God.''
</P>
<P>
   But unforeseen circumstances have clouded that vision. A Mexican
priest who was the pastor of a Spanish-language mission parish in
Muscatine, a Mississippi River city of 23,500 people about 25 miles
northeast of Columbus Junction, left last year. As one of the few
priests in the diocese who can speak Spanish, Weir was assigned to
take his place while continuing to serve Columbus Junction and
another parish.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of June he relinquished the English-language Mass in
Columbus Junction to two priests who would visit from nearby towns.
``It was just getting too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has upset some people who go to the
English-language Mass, among them Pam Braun, the wife of the school
board member. Mrs. Braun is sympathetic to the immigrants and said
she thinks her children benefit by being exposed to another culture
in their schools. But at church, she said, attendance has fallen.
``How do we have relationships with itinerant priests?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Weir said he did not think it was good for two groups in the
same parish to be served by different priests. ``Unfortunately,
it's the reality in many places,'' he said.

   MELROSE, Mass. _ Weighing in on an issue where rivals for the
White House had staked out positions weeks ago, Elizabeth Dole
Wednesday proposed streamlining the federal government's role in
education by giving states and local districts the power to
determine how federal money should be spent and academic targets
met.
</P>
<P>
   At Melrose High School here, where the Republican presidential
hopeful was a student teacher more than 40 years ago, Dole spoke to
an audience of the school's brightest youngsters _ class officers
and honor students _ and proposed ``zero tolerance'' for classmates
who disrupt lessons and cause disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by the class president, Emily Bachman, Dole quipped:
``Hmmm. Female president. That sounds pretty good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Dole's vision hearkened to an earlier age, stressing
discipline and putting ``teachers back in charge of their
classrooms.'' She proposed that school officials search the lockers
and backpacks of students and test them for drug use, subject to
their parents' approval. And disciplinary records of problem
students, she said, should travel ``with the young person from
school to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Although federal money plays a relatively minor role in
financing public education, voters have identified education as a
priority in public opinion surveys as the presidential primaries
approach. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore
both made policy speeches on the issue several weeks ago as summer
vacation drew to an end.
</P>
<P>
   For her policy speech, Dole chose as her backdrop a school whose
principal, Daniel R. Burke, has made a crusade of restoring
discipline, clearing the halls of students cutting classes or
milling about and outlawing hats in school. Behind Dole, aides had
stacked the 8-inch pile of papers of the elementary and secondary
education reauthorization bill, which she waved at throughout her
speech as if it were an unwieldy beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the federal government has 788 different federal
education programs,'' she said. ``These provide only 7 percent of
the money that we spend on public schools, but they create 50
percent of the paperwork for teachers and administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning school vouchers, Dole proposed annual tax
credits of up to $1,000 a person for contributions to nonprofit
educational foundations associated with public or private schools.
The credits would presumably be granted in addition to deductions
already permitted for donations to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gift,'' Dole said, ``could be used for books,
scholarships or other education purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying she favored ``a rich smorgasbord of education choices,''
Dole mentioned ``opportunity scholarships for students in failing
schools, or charter schools or home schooling'' as potential
solutions. But she did not offer details.
</P>
<P>
   Asked explicitly about her position on vouchers after her talk,
Dole sidestepped the question, essentially paraphrasing from her
speech her support for her version of the three R's: returning
control to states and local school districts, restoring discipline
and reinforcing parents' involvement in their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Driscoll, a 74-year-old retired secretary who showed up to
hear Dole, said that she was pleased to see a woman running for the
presidency but that she had doubts about Dole's proposal to scrap
federal regulations wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the federal regulations exist because parents have
abdicated their roles,'' Ms. Driscoll said. ``We can't just go back
in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The young people chosen to listen to the candidate said they
agreed with her emphasis and with their principal's stress on
discipline. ``He's getting us more ready for the real world,'' said
Joseph Matara, a 17-year-old senior.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Joshua Goldstein, 16, said he did not mind the bag
or locker checks, particularly after the spate of killings at
schools like the one in Columbine, Colo. ``You're in school to
learn, not to worry about getting killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one uninvited student managed to make her way
inside to film the speech, and her reaction was quite different.
Emily Taffe, 17, said she realized that schools needed ``to be
pulled out of the abyss,'' but Dole's message sounded heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a prison,'' Miss Taffe said. ``We're here because
we have to be, but that doesn't mean it has to be so harsh.''

MCINTOSH FAMILY TREE 
HOME FOR THE WINTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Last year, I picked tart and crunchy ``native New England
Macouns'' at an orchard in Massachusetts, but at another place the
owner declared them ``a cross between McIntosh and a Cortland
type.'' Given the similarities in taste, coloring and name, one
might suspect a common lineage for Macs and Macouns. But what is
the relationship?
</P>
<P>
   A. Like a Kentucky Derby winner put out to stud, the McIntosh, a
venerable apple first found about 1800 on John McIntosh's farm in
Ontario, has been crossed with many other apples, often with
winning results.
</P>
<P>
   Your Macoun, introduced in 1923, is the result of a McIntosh
crossed with a Jersey Black.
</P>
<P>
   Cortland, introduced in 1915, is a Macoun half-sister: a
McIntosh crossed with an apple called Ben Davis. Other interesting
offspring of the prolific McIntosh include Empire (a 1966
introduction, whose other parent is unknown), Jonamac (1972,
Jonathan), Spartan (1936, Newtown), Summerred (1964, Golden
Delicious) and Tydeman Early (1945, Worcester Pearmain). One of my
favorite apples, Liberty, is a McIntosh grandchild, a cross between
a Macoun and a Purdue 54-12.
</P>
<P>
   This year's dry spring and summer has resulted in a bumper crop,
but not all the interesting ones will get to the supermarket. To
help you find more interesting apples and other produce at farms in
the New York region, the state's Agriculture and Markets Department
has published a new edition of ``The Guide to Farm Fresh
Products.'' A free copy is available by calling (800) 554-4501 or
from www.agmkt.state.ny.us, the department's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Home for the Winter
</P>
<P>
   Q. My houseplants have spent the summer on my porch. I will move
them back inside soon. But I've noticed earwigs in my spider
plants. Should I spray with a pesticide before bringing them in, or
should I wait until the temperature drops enough to harm the bugs
(but not, I hope, the plants)?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most houseplants are tropical or subtropical in origin while
the bugs are local, so I wouldn't want to bet on giving bugs the
cold shoulder before the plants begin to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Earwigs and other insects in the soil can be forced to the
surface by soaking the pot up to its rim in a sink full of water.
What you do with the bugs as they surface is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Plants like their changes gradual, to ease the shock of new
surroundings. Inside, light and humidity levels are much lower,
while temperatures are higher. Move them into shadier spots a week
or two before bringing them inside, but most have to be inside
before night temperatures are consistently below 50 degrees. A few,
including bay laurel, cactus, camellia, citrus, clivia, ivies,
Norfolk Island pine, scented geranium and oleander, can stay out
until nights regularly approach 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   A GREENER SPRING
</P>
<P>
   Q. I saved seeds for a fall crop of spinach but never planted
them. Will they be OK to plant next spring?  &QL; 
A. There's a certain sadness about fall cleanup and shutting down
the garden. But one of the things to lighten a gardener's heart is
to seed some cold-tolerant varieties of spinach in the fall and let
the young plants overwinter. By giving them a head start, you
insure that you will be eating fresh spinach salad next spring
while your friends are still waiting for their seeds to germinate.
And even better, during the long winter, you can occasionally think
about it quietly waiting there and let a faint smile play across
your lips.
</P>
<P>
   Fall Green, Vienna or Winter Bloomsdale are varieties
recommended for overwintering. Planting them up to the second week
of October gives them a chance to develop a few leaves and roots
before winter. They don't need to be mulched: the leaves will get
ratty through the winter, but the root system will be fine. When
spring arrives, new leaves will sprout from the established root
system.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have one of the varieties that overwinter, your
seeds should be all right. Spinach seeds remain viable for three
years if stored cool and dry.  &QL;

FILM SPOTLIGHTS MEXICAN WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mexican War of the 1840s wasn't fought solely by Mexicans
and Americans. The sons of Irish immigrants, fleeing the potato
famine, joined the U.S. Army with the promise of citizenship and
land for their families. The historical drama ``One Man's Hero'' is
about a group of those Irish soldiers who, after suffering
persecution for their Catholic beliefs, deserted and eventually
wound up fighting for the Mexican side _ and became Mexican heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Berenger plays Sgt. John Riley, the leader of the Irish
troops, who deserts his post with a group of young soldiers after
saving them from lashings by their martinet commander (Stephen
Tobolowsky, in a thankless, one-dimensional role); they were being
punished for crossing the border to attend Catholic Mass. Riley
takes the men to Mexico, where they're captured by
</P>
<P>
   guerrillas fighting the Mexican government. But it's the
government that ultimately offers Riley and his men a choice: fight
for Mexico and earn land to settle on, or die. Riley chooses to
fight, and his rag-tag band becomes known as St. Patrick's
Battalion _ or Los San Patricios.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' is one of those frustrating movies that are
better than they could have been and not as good as they should
have been. That sounds oxymoronic, but both sides of the argument
are based in the movie's low budget (director Lance Hool struggled
for two decades to get the movie made, and even now it's getting a
haphazard, underpromoted release).
</P>
<P>
   With Berenger at the fore, struggling with an Irish accent,
``One Man's Hero'' resembles one of those historic dramas made for
TNT _ at least till the second half, when the battle scenes hit
high gear. Berenger is earnest, though, as is the movie; it's so
intent on educating you that it sometimes feels like an unusually
well-done high-school history-class film.
</P>
<P>
   But if the movie had had more financial backing, it really could
have been something. One wonders what someone like Steven Spielberg
could have done with this story, especially after Spielberg made
his fascination with history evident with ``Amistad'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mexican War has to be one of the most ignored
subjects of the past 30 or 40 years, almost to the point that
anything on the subject would be welcome. And the movie provides
good parts for multifaceted Mexican star Daniela Romo (as a nurse
who becomes Riley's love interest) and character actor Joaquim de
Almeida (''Clear and Present Danger''), who gives the film's best
performance as the conflicted rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' isn't interested in being objective, although
it is fair enough to mention that not all Americans were in favor
of the war. And in the movies, where fiction almost always corrupts
fact, history must be taken with a grain of salt. ``One Man's
Hero'' will have as much of an uphill battle at the box office as
its protoganists had in war, but it will probably send those who
see it scrambling to the Internet or the library to find out more
about its subject. And that, really, is all the filmmakers could
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Man's Hero'' is rated R for violence.

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright complained on
Wednesday that congressional unwillingness to pay what the United
States owes to the United Nations has hamstrung the
administration's ability to influence the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to hide it,'' Albright said. ``They resent
us deeply because we are not paying, and we are the backbone of the
U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary expressed her frustration in the course of
briefing reporters about her meetings on Wednesday with a
succession of foreign ministers and other senior officials
attending the opening sessions of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the accumulated arrears, which the United Nations
estimates at $1.6 billion, have made it particularly difficult to
recruit allies for the kind of structural reforms that Congress
demands as a condition of paying the back dues and other
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening up here is that they see us as making
certain demands that undercut a bureaucracy that they have some
interest in, while not paying any money,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's warning about the debt is hardly new. She
expressed it when she was the chief American delegate to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But her latest complaint comes on the heels of President
Clinton's speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, in which he
promised to ``do our very best to succeed this year'' in meeting
financial obligations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promise got a cool reception, with some diplomats
asserting that he has neither the influence nor the will to get
Congress to honor a treaty obligation that the United States
assumed when it helped form the United Nations 54 years ago. The
contentious mood is unlikely to have escaped Albright in her
various meetings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's very difficult for the United States to assume a
leadership role as long as we don't pay our bills,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Wednesday morning at her suite in the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, Albright discussed prospects for reviving the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara. Both countries
have expressed interest in picking up the talks, which convened
briefly in late 1995. But they remain far apart on the critical
question of Israel's return of the Golan Heights, which it captured
during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an interest to move forward from both sides,'' said
Albright, who spoke several times about a mutual seriousness of
purpose. But she cautioned that a breakthrough would not take place
in a single meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question, the secretary expressed the hope that
informal discussions among the Security Council members would
produce a consensus on a new resolution for monitoring Iraq's
clandestine weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said there was no room for compromise on the United
States' position that inspectors must be free to work without
interference if they return to Iraq. And she made clear that
sanctions would not be lifted until Iraq complied with the
disarmament conditions imposed after its defeat in the 1991 Persian
Gulf war. Baghdad wants the sanctions ended first, and has heard
varying measures of sympathy from Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary held other meetings on Wednesday with Foreign
Minister Amre Mahmoud Moussa of Egypt and with President Glafcos
Clarides of Cyprus. She was also to meet the Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.

PANEL ON 2000 FINDS NEWS LARGELY GOOD

   Although serious concerns remain, especially in health care,
small businesses, local government and education, the United States
is largely prepared for year 2000 computer problems, according to
the committee that has been the Senate's chief watchdog on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the committee said, it has become increasingly
worried that lagging preparations overseas could lead to economic
disruptions severe enough to hurt U.S. businesses and generate
pleas for international aid.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the committee's report with just 100 days
left until Jan. 1 was one of many public and private sector year
2000 events this week, most with generally positive overviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably more complacency that will come out of this
than we would like,'' said Sen. Robert F. Bennett, the Utah
Republican who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the
Year 2000 Problem. ``We are in much better shape than I would have
anticipated a year and a half ago, but people who go through the
details of the report will find plenty of indication that there is
still much work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 computer problem stems from representing the year
in electronic dates with just two digits, like 99 for 1999. Faulty
devices and programs can malfunction when they read 00 as 1900
instead of 2000 or simply fail to recognize it as a valid date.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 flaws have been popping up for years in software _ a
separate report out Wednesday said that 82 percent of large
companies had already encountered them _ but the first weeks of
January are expected to bring the largest volume of malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The report on large companies, which is sponsored by CAP Gemini
America, an information technology consulting company in New York,
said that although nearly half did not expect to have all of their
critical computer systems fixed before the end of the year, only 12
percent expected such vulnerable systems to pose a ``significant
business risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also reported that 44 percent of the year 2000
malfunctions to date occurred in systems the companies had
repaired. Computer experts say that it is common to introduce new
errors when debugging software, which is one reason contingency
planning for breakdowns is an essential part of year 2000
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say everything is fine and rosy,'' said James
Woodward, head of CAP Gemini America's information systems
management group.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many recent reports and presentations are certainly emphasizing
optimistic expectations. Perhaps more strikingly, a National
Association of Manufacturers poll of vital concerns of small
manufacturers published Wednesday did not even bother to pose a
question about year 2000. Earlier this year, the manufacturing
group had seen the threat of year 2000 problems and lawsuits as so
important that it made legislation restricting litigation one of
its main policy objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Senate report, which is available on the Internet at
www.senate.gov/y2k/documents/100dayrpt, contained no major
surprises for computer experts and others involved in year 2000
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's biggest areas of concern were generally in
sectors where information about preparations has been hard to
obtain. In the $1.5 trillion health care industry, the committee
praised year 2000 programs at drug companies, distributors and
major hospitals but expressed grave concerns about the readiness of
computer systems in the nation's 50,000 doctors' offices and 15,000
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is that we simply can't get information about
them,'' Bennett said.

   SHANGHAI, China _ The 50th anniversary of the People's Republic
of China is being heralded here with a celebration intended by the
government to top all celebrations. On Friday morning, half a
million invited citizens will gather in Tiananmen Square in Beijing
for a speech by President Jiang Zemin, followed by the biggest
military parade in the country's history, with 90 floats, 140,000
marchers, numerous tanks and weapons, and 130 sorties by Chinese
Air Force planes.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, 100,000 dancers and singers will perform. When darkness
finally falls, fireworks displays with names like ``Chanting the
Eulogy of the Motherland'' will burst forth simultaneously from 10
locations around the capital.
</P>

   Meanwhile, a performing-arts festival in Beijing, which began an
Aug. 1 and runs until Oct. 15, is presenting theatrical and
operatic groups from around the country. Organized by the Ministry
of Culture, it includes 100 different productions of traditional
opera, Western opera, drama, dance, symphonic music, puppetry,
acrobatics and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent all the different performing arts in China,''
said Wang Wenzhang, the director of the ministry's arts department.
``Seventy-seven come from outside Beijing. These include troupes
from the army, the railroad, the coal mines and the handicapped,
but most are professional companies. Also, 23 performances will be
staged by the 11 companies that the Culture Ministry manages
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the festival began in 1998, when each province
and region was asked not only to select two of its best stage
performances to send to Beijing but also to organize its own
festival. ``Most of the performances are intended to represent the
new society,'' Wang explained. ``In the 50 years of new China,
except for the Cultural Revolution, literary and artistic thought
has been liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 50th-anniversary performing-arts festival
underscores not so much the liberation of the performing arts as
the extent to which further liberation is needed. For, 50 years
out, China's performing arts are stifling under the weight of the
system created to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party policies, some well intentioned and others
deliberately repressive, have accomplished what no emperor ever
could: the virtual silencing of the performing arts as an
alternative voice in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed at which culture has developed has no comparison to
the economy,'' said Jin Xing, a modern dancer and choreographer.
``We have a very rich culture full of artists, but we don't have
art. Propaganda and politics have messed everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which propaganda and politics have messed things
up varies among the art forms. While film is subject to strict
censorship, China has produced several acclaimed directors whose
movies take top prizes in international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from Hollywood helps; the government does not want to
see China's film industry supplanted by foreign movies, and it
likes seeing Chinese directors acclaimed abroad. And television _
the realm of schlock and kitsch, to be sure _ still attracts talent
because it pays well.
</P>
<P>
   Visual artists in Beijing and Shanghai increasingly push the
limits of government control by staging unauthorized exhibitions
that would shock even in the West with their explicit sexuality or
extreme morbidity. Though they may be closed within a day,
exhibitions can be held almost anywhere, and others soon crop up.
</P>
<P>
   But with few exceptions, the performing arts offer little
innovation or creativity. And the prime factor keeping them
moribund is their age-old link to politics.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of holding a performing-arts festival, which dates
from the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic, is a
contemporary illustration of this link. But antecedents are as
abundant as some of them are ancient.
</P>
<P>
   A famous example was the celebration of the 80th birthday of the
Qing Dynasty Emperor Qianlong in 1790. Opera was the main
performing art in traditional China and troupes from around the
country were invited to Beijing for the occasion, touching off a
major opera revival.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the sixth century B.C., Confucius considered
music and dance so integral to political power that he fiercely
opposed performances staged just for entertainment. History records
that when the great sage found himself at a merry show mounted by
jesters, singers and dwarfs in the home of a lord, he protested
furiously: ``Commoners who beguile their lords deserve to die. Let
them be punished!'' The performers were promptly killed.
</P>
<P>
   As China grew increasingly Confucianized, so did its official
arts policy. By the Ming Dynasty, in the mid-14th century, all
dramas critical of emperors, princes or sages were prohibited,
while those about ``righteous men and chaste women, filial sons and
obedient grandsons, and those who encourage the people to do good''
were encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   To give teeth to this policy, the Yongle Emperor ordered that
those found with banned works ``should be killed, together with
their entire families.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Qianlong Emperor adopted a more modern approach to
censorship, establishing a committee that collected 1,000 dramas
from around the country and expurgated or destroyed those deemed
morally or politically suspect. Of course, imperial efforts to
foster pro-Confucian dramas and ban all others were far from
uniformly successful. The mere fact that one emperor after another
felt obliged to issue bans shows how popular heterodox dramas
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the 20th century, traditional Chinese opera was so
closely associated with Confucianism, and Confucianism with
backwardness, that reform-minded intellectuals argued for the
abandonment or modernization of the ancient art form. They
orchestrated the creation of ``new dramas'' with antifeudal and
anti-imperialist themes, featuring actors in contemporary costumes.
</P>
<P>
   They also introduced spoken drama to China, staging plays like
``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ``A Doll's House'' to encourage social
and political change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoken drama, opera, it was all in the service of
revolution,`` said Liu Housheng, a drama critic who specialized in
opera before 1949 and spoken drama afterward.
</P>
<P>
   When the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 failed to bring
about constructive change, many intellectuals and artists pinned
their hopes on the Communist Party. The party widely employed
performing-arts troupes to spread word of communism and the party's
own goals.
</P>
<P>
   Art had always been a tool of ideology and regime maintenance in
China, but Mao Zedong made this relationship more explicit. In a
1942 conference on arts and literature held at the Communist base
in Yanan, the future chairman of Communist China stated bluntly:
``There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that
stands above classes or art that is detached from or independent of
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That speech became seminal in determining arts policy in the
People's Republic and remains influential to this day. Once in
power, the new regime built institutions through which art could be
used to promote political goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Culture sank roots throughout the country,
setting up bureaus on the provincial and local levels and bringing
all performing-arts companies under its umbrella. Cooperation with
the Soviet Union was critical in that period, and the arts system
that China established was essentially a mirror of that in the
U.S.S.R.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mao stressed the political nature of art, he did not
ignore the importance of artistic standards. If art was to serve
politics, it had to be good. To insure high standards, and proper
political thinking, training schools were set up nationwide,
replacing the system of indentured apprenticeships that had long
been the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first _ and most laudable _ goals of the new
regime was to improve the social status of actors. Confucius'
attitude toward performers was not exceptional; until the 19th
century, actors were commonly sold as slaves. The system of
indenture that replaced slavery _ eight years of apprenticeship
followed by three years of unpaid labor _ was only a minor
improvement. Many child actors were sexually abused, and the
profession was so closely associated with prostitution that its
members could never mingle in polite society.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers worked to remedy this situation in the early 20th
century with only partial success. In Shanghai, for instance,
gangsters demanded payoffs before shows right up to 1949; actors
who refused found their performances interrupted by barrages of
eggs, garbage and human waste.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, subtle battles were waged between political
dogmatists and those who believed that the quality of art should
take precedence over its politics. Some forms of opera that had
died out were revived, including kunqu, the style of ``The Peony
Pavilion,'' which was performed at Lincoln Center in July.
</P>
<P>
   Previously ignored folk art forms, like dance, puppetry and
acrobatics, were given government support. Efforts were also made
to create performing arts that were neither ancient nor Western.
One result was a kind of song and dance spectacle that combined
folk dance and melodies with Western instruments and
orchestrations. Overall, however, the trend was toward increased
politicization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art served politics,'' said Liu, the critic. ``Everything was
propaganda, about land reform or about opposing America and
supporting Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicization of the performing arts reached its height in
the 1960s. In a perverse repetition of history, Mao's wife, Jiang
Qing, reviewed more than 1,000 operas and concluded that nearly all
should be banned because they were about ``ghosts, emperors,
officials, scholars and concubines.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, all
traditional operas were banned, along with virtually every other
performing art. Jiang Qing then engineered the creation of a new
genre of ``revolutionary modern model operas,'' which featured
heroic socialist archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   The model operas, which remain popular, were based on Peking
opera but incorporated Western instruments, which she considered
``heroic'' and thought better inspired revolution. Several of the
eight model operas were also adapted for regional opera forms,
symphony orchestras and minority nationality song and dance
troupes, and even made into piano concertos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arts schools that had been established in the 1950s closed down,
and countless actors, musicians and dramatists died in prison or
were driven to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Revolution left all performing arts utterly
debilitated. But when it finally ended, a slow rebuilding began.
Artists were rehabilitated, and government controls were loosened
by new officials, many of whom had suffered themselves. The
subsequent flowering of the performing arts, which lasted into the
mid-1980s, is widely considered the golden age of theater under the
People's Republic. ``The period 1976 to 1986 was a high tide for
drama,'' said Liu, the drama critic.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late '80s, a slow decline set in. Economic reforms
brought reduced government financing of the arts and greater
competition from movies, television and karaoke. The crushing of
student protests in 1989 led to a tightening of restraints on all
forms of public expression, including the artistic.
</P>
<P>
   The number of arts troupes began to fall; according to Wang, of
the Ministry of Culture, there were 4,000 performing-arts companies
under the ministry's supervision in 1978 as against 2,640 today.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies exist in name only; they are so short of
cash that they almost never perform and must run side businesses
just to meet payroll and pensions. Performers' salaries failed to
keep pace with inflation, and the average pay today barely amounts
to a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Audience interest has also gone flat; a survey last year in
Shanghai found that 75 percent of respondents had not entered a
theater in years. If there is a bright spot, it is the decision of
major cities like Shanghai and Beijing to invest heavily in
world-class theaters, which both excites public interest and
creates a need for more and better performing-arts productions.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy left to the performing arts by their age-old linkage
to politics is complex. Government recognition of the importance of
the arts remains strong, and relatively speaking, so does
government support.
</P>
<P>
   Most Asian nations do not have even one Western opera company;
China has one in nearly every province. Schools and conservatories
continue to churn out actors, singers, dancers and musicians,
giving China, in technical terms, one of the most artistically
trained populations on earth. Though performing-arts workers are
not well paid, neither do they have to struggle and starve.
</P>
<P>
   Yet official recognition of the power of the performing arts is
a double-edged sword, bringing with it control. Though Deng
Xiaoping denounced Cultural Revolution-era arts policies as
``preposterous,'' Mao's opinions on the arts have never been
displaced, and official guidelines have been left conveniently
vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deng Xiaoping said that there should be no arbitrary meddling
in the arts,'' Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
   That such arbitrary meddling still occurs is all too obvious.
Indeed, a classic case was played out in the international
spotlight last year, when Shanghai cultural officials banned the
Lincoln Center Festival production of ``The Peony Pavilion.''
Though many officials considered the action ludicrous and
embarrassing, the decision was allowed to stand, because the
ultimate right to judge the quality and usefulness of art belongs
to the government, not to artists or audiences, and certainly not
to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize this point, Shanghai's culture bureau has invested
more than $350,000 to produce its own version of ``The Peony
Pavilion,'' which will be performed in October as part of
Shanghai's 50th-anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of meddling and control varies greatly, depending on
region, art form, economics, personal relationships and the
preferences of individual bureaucrats. Beijing, for instance, is
considered a more arts-friendly environment than Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing is much more free than Shanghai,'' said a Shanghai
opera director who would speak only without attribution. ``Shanghai
is closed. In Beijing, you have all the bureaucrats. If one says
no, another will say yes. But in Shanghai, it's just Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, there is greater freedom to innovate in
imported theatrical arts than in traditional Chinese arts, about
which many officials and ``experts'' have opinions, a lesson
brought home by the ``Peony'' debacle. The most innovative theater
in Beijing is spoken drama, with a heavy emphasis on works by
Western playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Classic dramas or new adaptations of old stories are also easier
to stage than original works; few of the productions traveling to
Beijing for the 50th anniversary are actually brand-new. There are,
for example, two versions of ``Wilderness,'' a play by the renowned
dramatist Cao Yu: one performed as Western opera, the other as
Sichuan opera.
</P>
<P>
   To entice writers to produce new plays that could be staged for
the 50th anniversary, the Shanghai government last year offered an
award of more than $10,000 for a quality script, but none was
found. Indeed, many artists sneered at the offer, saying that no
amount of money was worth the grief that would come when
bureaucrats on every level capriciously demanded rewrites.
</P>
<P>
   While control of the performing arts may vary, it never
vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arts have always been a tool of politics,'' said a former
arts official, who, once again, insisted on anonymity. ``After
opening-up, there was Ping-Pong diplomacy, and then there was
cultural diplomacy. All the traditional arts troupes went overseas,
and foreign ones came here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the performing arts remain a tool of politics, the nature
of their political role has changed. Audiences and officials alike
still tend to scour even the most innocuous performances for hidden
political meaning. But overt political content and blatant
propaganda, still offered up by some theater directors, are for the
most part just as actively discouraged by most officials.
</P>
<P>
   Xie Boliang, a drama professor and a member of Shanghai's
committee to select 50th-anniversary productions, scoffed at the
politicized pieces one local opera company offered up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all about being a good comrade,'' he said. ``Too
political and too realistic. This is not the leftist era. You can't
oppose politics or government, but your drama should still be
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, at the Ministry of Culture, echoed these views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stress artistic quality,'' he said of the performances
chosen for the 50th anniversary. ``This is not propaganda. The
performances should reflect the lives of the people, but using
artistic methods. This is an important principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjective ``artistic'' crops up often in conversations with
officials and critics, as does the seemingly innocent imperative
that art should ``reflect the lives of the people.'' Reflecting the
people's lives was, in fact, a key part of Mao's philosophy of art
as espoused at Yanan: the only legitimate raw material for art is
the life of the people.
</P>
<P>
   While many artists are perfectly happy to reflect the people's
lives _ however ``people,'' ``life'' and ``artistic'' might be
defined by prevailing authorities _ others chafe under such
ambiguous constraints. Some struggle on, but others turn to more
lucrative work in television or business, or vote with their feet
by moving to cities like New York.
</P>
<P>
   This more pragmatic approach may be one reason no influential
arts underground has developed in China, as it did in the U.S.S.R.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, for their part, still tend to prefer pirated movies
to theater, unless the show is an international co-production or
comes from overseas. There is no mad scramble for tickets to
50th-anniversary performances; few outside arts circles even know
the festival is going on. And China's performing arts, despite
their rich traditions and talented performers, continue to make
virtually no impact on the global stage.
</P>
<P>
   The talent is definitely there, but the support needed to give
that talent direction and funding, and create an environment in
which it could feed off itself, isn't,'' said William Brent, the
executive director of Art and Culture Promotion, a company that
specializes in performing-arts exchanges between the West and
China. ``Without it, it's going to be really hard for anything
exceptional to come out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   A wish list of support would include a drastic increase in
private financing of the performing arts, especially in the form of
endowed foundations backed by tax incentives. The dated quota
system that requires troupes to perform hundreds of times a year in
factories, schools and the countryside also needs to be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The fulfillment of such quotas is usually pro forma _ a troupe
that has not met its quota by early autumn will suddenly go to the
suburbs and stage the same opera excerpt three times a day for
several weeks _ but it is still a managerial and financial burden.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream press, even leaving aside political
considerations, could play a more constructive role. As it is,
audiences know that most press coverage in Beijing must be
purchased; the ``transportation fee'' for a print journalist to
attend a press conference announcing a new production is typically
$25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   Theatergoers therefore believe nothing they read and rely almost
exclusively on word of mouth in deciding what to see. Indeed, so
perverse is the relationship between the press and the public that
if a production receives a strongly negative review, people will
clamor to see it, though by that point it has usually been shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of legacy versus creativity,'' said the former
arts official, as she considered the current state of the
performing arts. ``China has the legacy, but the creativity? I
think first we need political change, then maybe there will be
changes in the arts.'' Still, like Ms. Jin, the choreographer, she
is quick to point out that much progress has been made since the
start of reform and ``opening'' in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years isn't that long,'' the ex-official said
hopefully. ``It seems long because human lives are short. But in
the history of China, it's not much time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I hope that the completion of the new Conde Nast
headquarters last month will make people think twice before
complaining about the Disneyfication of Times Square. Things are
better than that, and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is but one in a group of media giants that have chosen to
settle here. Besides Conde Nast, publishers of The New Yorker,
Vogue, Vanity Fair and other glamorous titles, the group includes
Reuters, Bertelsmann, Billboard Publications and MTV. Ornamenting
this mediacratic convergence are the new television studios that
have begun to blossom along the sidewalks of Broadway and Seventh
Avenue like exotic hothouse fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square has always stood for popular culture and
entertainment, but never has such a concentration of pop producers
and consumers been gathered together in one place.
</P>
<P>
   This development is surely preferable to the hulking quartet of
nearly identical corporate towers originally planned to rise here.
Unless it's not. For despite the great differences in architecture,
signage and market niche, the new Times Square is now suffused with
a sense of sameness, of homogenized spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even this is useful. It's a striking demonstration
of the protean nature of the monoculture: the system of promotion,
distribution and consumption on which advanced capitalism relies.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Nast Building at 4 Times Square shows how capably
commercial architecture has adapted to this system. The building's
design offers a picture of commercial architecture at its most
inventive. If that seems like a contradiction in terms, so is 4
Times Square. A house divided against itself, it wants to be at
once a background building and a foreground building, both star and
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fox and Bruce Fowle, the two principals in Fox &AMP; Fowle
Architects, are attentive students of urban context. They
invariably try to do the right thing. Sometimes, too many right
things.
</P>
<P>
   Fox &AMP; Fowle has described its approach to the design of the
51-story tower as one of layering. The layers begin at the
ground-floor level with commercial signs and the armatures that
support them. They continue up the shaft of the building with a
series of shallow setbacks in glass and stone.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the setbacks varies in each of the building's
four elevations, with the proportion of glass increasing as the
tower rises. I call this building a Phoebe because, like the
unctuous Broadway wannabe who shows up at Anne Baxter's apartment
at the end of ``All About Eve,'' 4 Times Square seems to be bowing
to itself in a three-sided mirror. This Phoebe bows in four
directions, one per side.
</P>
<P>
   The 42d Street facade gives us Phoebe by Day: This is Career
Phoebe. She bows not to the naughty, gaudy Deuce, but toward the
classical composition of the Public Library and Bryant Park nearby.
She gets to wear lots of well-tailored gray flannel granite here,
along with some striking acccessories: a trim glass canopy above
the entrance and some understated, brushed aluminum trim.
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe by Night. On the town, with starlight in her eyes, she
reflects all the glitter and tinsel of the Great White Way. Here is
where you find the electrical signage, the NASDAQ studio and the
big round cylinder on the corner, seven stories tall, with
punch-through windows. There's also a door partway up, and I regret
that this will be covered with the NASDAQ sign, because I was
having fantasies that this could be turned into a dummy Special
Projects office for expired Conde Nast editors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cylinder, there would be a Potemkin reception area,
with nice leather sofas and a secretary on hand to show the editor
around his or her new office. This would turn out to be a gangplank
cantilevered over Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe in Paris. The top of the tower is our Eiffel Tower
moment: the square steel structure pops out of the building
envelope and rises an additional to form a crown of exposed
girders. From these will be suspended four gigantic billboards, two
of them tilted slightly to catch the gaze of tourists in the
street. But the building may be too tall for that gesture.
</P>
<P>
   It will be impossible to judge the effect until the billboards
are in operation, but it's not too soon to note that the signs will
also be clearly visible from many other parts of town and probably
from New Jersey too, and that this is likely to cause an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. New York's illuminated skyscraper crowns,
brilliantly orchestrated by the lighting designer Douglas Leigh in
the 1970s, have been one of the major civic achievements of recent
years. Part of what makes them great is that they are uncommercial.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the city has transcended individual self-interest and
gained at least the illusion of a collective expression. The signs
at 4 Times Square could detract from this accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   A microwave radio antenna pokes up in the center of the steel
supercube. This is the building's steeple, the electronic obelisk
of an information age. Figuratively, if not literally, it feeds
Times Square out into the atmosphere. The whole crown will one day
become an antenna farm for cell phone service providers. Even now,
however, it looks like a bunch of hardware someone left out on the
roof to rust.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The architects chose to disregard my grooming suggestions. Too
bad! As I suggested in a review of the design, the building could
do without the cornices and finials that articulate the top edges
of the planes. Presumably, these are intended to emphasize scale.
But scale in a glass curtain wall building comes from the rhythm of
window mullions and from glimpses of the spaces, partitions and
ceiling fixtures inside. These hints of depth make a good
impression on 4 Times Square's western elevation. They would look
even better without the metal bangs.
</P>
<P>
   So would the structural crown. That's one tough piece of
engineering up there. It's not just a show-off thing. It expresses
the fact that the building turns the usual order of skyscraper
construction upside-down. Here, mechanical equipment ordinarily
found in the basement has been relocated to the tower's top floors.
The weight of the equipment serves as a damper, which enabled the
architects to lighten the building's structural frame.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to read the text of the crown under any
circumstances, but the attempts at refinement on the lower stories
create an effect of incoherence. We have two very different
sensibilities at work, without an effective transition or contrast
between them.
</P>
<P>
   I admire Fox &AMP; Fowle for attempting a new kind of crown; we're
all weary of the paperweight building tops that architects like
Cesar Pelli have made their stock in trade. But at 4 Times Square
an opportunity was lost to rethink how the cultivated tradition of
modern architecture grew out of the vernacular tradition of
engineering, and how this, in turn, is giving way to forms derived
from information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The building's strongest feature is the curved edge on the
southwest side. Glare from the sun melts the edge; this helps
reduce the impression of bulk. Looking up at it, you can see that
the building envelope wanted to be a much simpler composition of
volumes and planes.
</P>
<P>
   In her mind's eye, Phoebe sees herself as a casual girl _
Weekend Phoebe _ dressed down in the Gap, Calvin Klein and other
classic American labels prominently featured on the billboards of
Times Square and on the sides of buses jolting by them.
</P>
<P>
   People who work in the area are having a hard time adjusting to
all this commotion, the crowds, the construction, the lines of
people waiting just to cross the street, the hordes of television
and music fans gawking at their idols.
</P>
<P>
   But Times Square has become a Baroque exercise in crowd
manipulation. The Baroque period gave us spectacular urban
ensembles, like St. Peter's Square, all designed for gathering the
faithful into the fold lest they be tempted by the forces of the
Reformation. At Times Square, people are brought back into the
streets lest they remain utterly captive to their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baroque Age, the faithful paid a price for allowing
themselves to be seduced by spectacle. That is no less true in
Times Square. The price for the Baroque population was to accept
the absolute authority of the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   For the MTV faithful, the price is to fall in line with the
monoculture. Baroque architects produced a dazzling array of forms,
but they all glorified one central authority. Similarly, in Times
Square the monoculture comes in every size, shape, color and taste,
but all is sliced from the same Styrofoam slab.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to see people on the streets. But the cost of
drawing them there could be substantial. In media terms, Times
Square represents the blurring of the boundary between advertising
and editorial, and the resulting distortions of truth.
</P>
<P>
   In architectural terms, it represents a blurring of the boundary
between art and commerce, and a sacrifice of the idea that
architecture is also a medium for conveying truths about the urban
condition. Truth in architecture is not the same as accuracy in
news reporting. It is not an objective truth.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that architecture and real estate are the same
thing is one of the grander deceptions New York practices upon
itself. Just ask Phoebe. Phoebe knows all about it.

ECONOMIC SCENE: REBATES COULD SMOOTH THE WAY FOR A MEDICARE REFORM
PLAN

<P>
   Is a flawed experiment in redesigning Medicare better than no
experiment at all?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Karen Ignagni, who represents managed care plans that
are fighting to block demonstrations designed to foster
competition. The problem, she says, is that the demonstrations,
scheduled to begin in 2001, ``leave out the government's
fee-for-service plan, tilting competition unfairly against private
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Nichols, an economist at the Urban Institute and a member of
the committee of independent experts that designed the
demonstrations, disagrees. He concedes the proposed competition, at
Congress' instruction, is far from ideal. But, he says, the
demonstrations ``can still yield invaluable lessons for Congress as
it ponders a national fix of Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Private plans and physicians are lined up behind Ms. Ignagni.
Economists line up behind Nichols. Congress is on the verge of
siding with the industry, putting the demonstrations on hold. But
Nichols thinks he has a way out of the impasse if Congress acts
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the administration in 1997 to create
demonstrations to test ways to make Medicare competitive. The
competition that already exists between private managed care plans
and the government's fee-for-service plan is crimped because the
government decides how much to pay private plans. Sometimes it pays
too little, driving private plans out of local markets. Sometimes
it pays too much, creating waste at taxpayer expense. The
demonstrations would use market forces to reveal the right price
rather than letting the government to flail about for the right
price.
</P>
<P>
   Congress prohibited the committee from subjecting the
government-run plan to competition. That, says Ms. Ignagni, ``means
that private plans will be paid less than the government plan,
forcing the private plans to crimp on benefits while the government
plan goes unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unfair competition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is no doubt true. The issue that separates Nichols from Ms.
Ignagni is whether the flaw is fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chose Phoenix and Kansas City, Mo., as the first
two demonstration sites. Political opposition exploded. In many
regions, the cost of fee-for-service medicine is sky high because
doctors are in the habit of prescribing costly drugs, tests and
procedures. In these high-cost regions, the government
automatically dishes out more money to private plans. The plans use
the revenue windfall to lure the elderly away from the government
plan by offering them additional benefits, like drug coverage and
low co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are delighted with the cozy arrangement. So too are
their physicians and patients. But the plans are understandably
petrified by competitive bidding, flawed or otherwise. Once firms
are driven to compete for business by setting low premiums, the
largesse under the current system could evaporate. The committee's
goal is to reduce premiums to a level sufficient to cover
guaranteed benefits and not a penny more. That is Ms. Ignagni's
worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols provides a powerful rejoinder to Ms. Ignagni. The
demonstrations, he said, ``can still reveal how to create vigorous
competition among plans and provide an inkling about potential
savings from competition.'' He compares the demonstration to the
methods used by major employers to control health care costs.
``Take a General Motors that decides to add managed care to its
fee-for-service offering,'' Nichols said. ``It would not think to
tie payments to managed care plans to the bloated costs of running
fee-for-service. Instead, it would solicit bids. That is what the
demonstration proposes to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nichols concedes that under current law, private plans have
too few tools to attract enrollees. Toward that end, the committee
met last week and decided to ask Congress to allow plans to offer
rebates _ in the form of lower monthly Medicare premiums. Rebates
can provide powerful recruiting tools and perhaps give
beneficiaries in demonstration sites something tangible if the
demonstrations go forward. That could dissolve some of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of providing rebates to enrollees who choose low-cost
private plans is hardly heretical. It lies at the heart of
President Clinton's plan as well as the plan proposed by Sen. John
Breaux of Louisiana and Rep. Bill Thomas of California. The
prominence of those plans might soften congressional opposition to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   It is ludicrous for Congress to overhaul Medicare without first
testing its ideas. Yet it looks increasingly clear that political
opposition from vested interests will continue to block
demonstrations. Last week's initiative by the committee offers a
way to persuade beneficiaries to become allies rather than
opponents of reform. If so, then the congressional delegations from
Phoenix and other demonstration sites might turn a tad less
resistant to a first, important step in redesigning Medicare.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ OK, we're going to see what Dr. Jane Goodall has been
up to lately, and at first you may find it a little icky-poo.
</P>
<P>
   It has to do with this red canvas tote that Goodall, the British
primatologist, has been schlepping around on her speaking
engagements, a bag that includes not just one inspirational stuffed
animal, but two.
</P>
<P>
   The older, a stuffed monkey called Mr. H. _ Goodall, who made
her reputation observing chimpanzees in the wild, has always named
her animals _ was given to her a few years ago by a U.S. marine who
was blinded and went on to be a very fine magician. Goodall whips
Mr. H. out for grown-ups as well as children, insisting, in a
British accent that is lately more Mary Poppins than Diana Rigg,
that if they touch it, it will change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The other toy is a black-and-white dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amber Mary,'' Goodall says. ``She was given to me by a little
girl who had saved her pocket money. Her little brother had died of
leukemia and she gave it to me so the orphan chimps wouldn't be
alone at night. I use it for my talks and when children say they
have no money, they couldn't possibly help, I tell them the story
and say, `Not even a few pennies?'''
</P>
<P>
   A little sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many hankies go up to eyes. It makes me weepy every time
I tell it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be a promotional tour that brings Goodall to our
city, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   There is a PBS special, ``Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope,'' which
will be broadcast at the end of October, and a book of the same
name, but Goodall's travels are more of a campaign, almost
religious, a crusade on behalf of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, when she saw a film on the brutal treatment of
laboratory chimps, Goodall has been traveling continuously to raise
money for seven chimp sanctuaries in Africa operated by the Jane
Goodall Institute. For the last 13 years, she has never been in one
place more than four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, on her way to Community Intermediate School 229 in
the Bronx, where she will talk to children about her Roots and
Shoots environmental program, she speaks of Ted Turner's chimp
channel, which she loathes, and a chimpanzee pictured on a cereal
box, which appears to be smiling, but is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a normal, happy smile,'' Goodall says. ``It's more a
grimace of terror, like this'' _ she does the grimace, showing
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Ham when he came down from space. It was the most
tortured face I've ever seen. The space capsule overheated and
plunged into the ocean. After that, they put him in a cage, alone
in the National Zoo. Quite a way to treat a hero. I missed meeting
Ham by a year, which I very much regret. He died young of an
enlarged heart, undoubtedly brought on by stress.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this makes Goodall sound like an ecological missionary, a
sort of wildlife nun, she will tell you, with a start at the word
``nun,'' that she doesn't see herself that way at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her, back in her hotel suite, what she does for fun, and
she'll report that after a grueling book tour she's been known to
run up the down escalator, then go to her room, hit the chocolates
and Scotch and count the money from the collection boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for living among the animals, it was something she always
wanted. Her parents (father an engineer, mother a novelist)
divorced when Jane was 12. Goodall grew up in genteel frugality in
a manor house in Bournemouth, on the coast. She got the itch for
Africa when she first read ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a waitress to earn the money to travel to Africa,
where, at 24, she landed a job as secretary to the paleontologist
Dr. Louis Leakey, an enthusiastic ladies man. He recruited Ms.
Goodall to observe chimpanzees, though she had no scientific
training. The doctorate from Cambridge came later. There were two
marriages: to a wildlife cinematographer who made Goodall a
National Geographic TV star and with whom she had a son, and to
Derek Bryceson, a member of the Tanzanian Parliament. He died in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written of Goodall's scientific findings, so let
us focus here on jungle love.
</P>
<P>
   In your new book, Goodall, you spend but one paragraph on your
first serious love affair but pages on your first meaningful
relationship with a chimp, who accepts a palm nut fruit from your
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked into his large and lustrous eyes,'' you wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Why so little on love and so much on the monkey?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fairly private person, I didn't want to write about
loving my husbands. Love stories _ you can go to any cinema and
read any novel. It isn't like what happened that day. It was rather
as though an alien came down. So magical, utterly magical, to break
down that mistrust and be able to communicate without the need for
words with another creature. I can still feel it to this day. And
it hasn't happened like that since. It was unique. Falling in love
with a human male is absolutely not unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted. The allegedly amorous Leakey, anything happen?
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible? Almost a giggle?
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have loved that, he would have loved to have had an
affair, but no. Fortunately, I was able to turn him into a fairy
foster father. Just with gentle resistance. He had everything I
wanted, I couldn't be nasty to him and I wouldn't have wanted to
be, he was wonderful. He felt happy about women, he liked their
company and I like the company of men.''

MORGAN STANLEY'S 3RD QUARTER PROFITS SLIGHTLY ABOVE WALL STREET
ESTIMATES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the most profitable Wall
Street firm, posted an earnings rise of more than half in the third
quarter, as stock underwriting and merger fees continued to bolster
the firm's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's net income for the fiscal third quarter, which
ended Aug. 31, surged 55 percent, to $970 million, or $1.65 a
share, from $626 million, or $1.01 a share, in the same period of
1998. Profits were slightly higher than the $1.61 a share expected
by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   All areas of Morgan Stanley's businesses contributed to the
profit growth, which one analyst called plain vanilla _ a steady
but unspectacular increase in everything from new stock issues to
the firm's Discover credit card business.
</P>
<P>
   The year-to-year profit comparison was inflated because last
year at this time Morgan Stanley and other securities firms were
suffering through a stock and bond markets slump that began with
Russia's default on its debt in August, 1998. Earnings growth is
slowing, however, from earlier this year, when Morgan Stanley
soared past analysts' estimates and reported quarterly earnings
records. Its profit was $1.15 billion in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steady and strong is okay with me,'' said Robert F. Scott,
Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer. ``We also had balance. We
are paying attention to all lines of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Securities and investment banking operations were the biggest
profit generator, with net income of $633 million, up 43 percent,
accounting for about two-thirds of the firm's total profit for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on behalf of customers and advising companies on mergers
and acquisitions contributed to a hefty rise in investment banking
revenue and trading commissions, the company said. Investment
banking revenue rose to a record $1.21 billion for the quarter.
Trading revenue more than doubled to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's money-management arm also rebounded with net
income of $135 million, up from break-even in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Net income from credit card services advanced 10 percent to $202
million. Scott said the company's effort to expand the Discover
Card franchise had begun to pay off after a period of seeking to
improve the quality of its credit card debt. He said the business
is on course to expand more rapidly now as it begins an
international push.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results were not quite as strong as those at rival Goldman
Sachs, which reported its third-quarter profit Tuesday. Goldman
earned $638 million in the quarter, double profits in the
year-earlier period and about equal to what it earned in the spring
quarter. Goldman's third-quarter earnings were helped by a big gain
in merchant banking, which can be volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan Stanley's earnings were a little higher quality than
Goldman's,'' said Amy Butte, brokerage industry analyst at Bear
Stearns. ``But both are premier franchises, and they are gaining
incremental share in the global business.''
</P>
<P>
   On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, Morgan Stanley's earnings
picture is less rosy. The firm is locked in a fierce battle for
market share in highly profitable areas of investment banking with
Goldman, Merrill Lynch and other firms, a battle that may have
contributed to some slippage in Morgan Stanley's ranking in the
worldwide equity business.
</P>
<P>
   The company's trading revenue also declined nearly 40 percent
from a record-setting second quarter. Interest rates rose and
prices of many types of bonds fell, hurting results. ``The trading
business definitely slowed from the stupendous levels in the first
and second quarters,'' said Richard Strauss, brokerage industry
analyst for Goldman. ``It's probably a good proxy of what we can
expect to see in the final quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   On a quarterly comparison, Morgan Stanley's asset management
business also had lackluster results. Assets under management
increased by $10 billion for the period, to $415 billion. That 2.5
percent quarterly growth rate reflects a rocky summer stock market
but also increasing competition for the money of individual
investors.

 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ariz., Miss.)REGULATORS SAY MIAMI DEFRAUDED(js) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The City of Miami, already besieged by scandals involving
election-law violations and political corruption, was accused by
federal regulators Wednesday of defrauding its bondholders by
deliberately concealing a financial crisis that engulfed city
government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation, which the city denies, was contained in an
administrative complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission against the city and two former city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said the city's misleading actions affected the
sale of $116.5 million in tax-exempt bonds issued in 1995 to
finance pensions, sewer construction and a public building project.
The commission is arguing, in effect, that the bond market might
have demanded a higher price or greater protections if it had known
the true state of the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to bondholders is unclear because the case may affect
Miami's overall credit rating, which can influence the prices at
which bonds trade in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, while not seeking any monetary penalties, is
asking an administrative law judge to find the city at fault and
require accurate reports on its finances in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest skirmish in a five-year campaign by the
commission to force cities, counties and other municipal bond
issuers to keep investors informed about significant changes in
their financial health, just as publicly traded corporations are
required to do, said John C. Mattimore, the assistant regional
director in the commission's office in Miami. Such cases have been
filed against Orange County, Calif., Maricopa County, Ariz.,
Syracuse, N.Y., and several small towns in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami case is likely to be closely watched by local
officials across the country because, if it is successful, it will
expand the traditional limits of the federal regulators'
jurisdiction in the municipal bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier cases, the Miami complaint accused the city of
issuing misleading bond documents in connection with the sale of
specific bond issues. But in this case, the city is also accused of
providing inaccurate financial statements to investors months after
the bonds were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Such subsequent reports have not been cited in earlier cases,
said William R. Baker, an associate director of the security
commission's enforcement division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although such statements are not required by any SEC rule or
regulation, what we are saying in this case is that whatever you
decide to disclose must be truthful,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the commission has accused the city of failing to
disclose publicly that its cash flow had precipitously declined
after the close of its 1994 fiscal year, raising the possibility
that it would not be able to cover its operating expenses and pay
the interest on its outstanding bonds during the 1995 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is fighting the charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas Tew, a lawyer for the city, said Miami officials fully
discussed the 1995 budget problems to its auditors, Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, and followed Deloitte's advice in preparing its financial
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that we violated the securities laws,'' Tew
said. ``We relied upon our auditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Ringel, a spokeswoman for Deloitte, said the firm had
cooperated fully with the regulators. A ruling in favor of the
commission ``should put an end to the city's claim that it was
unaware of its true financial condition, and to its efforts to
shift responsibility to others,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami, the complaint is the latest in a long series of
corruption cases. In the past six years, state charges have been
filed against at least 270 public employees, as the city has
wrestled with hectic growth, ethnic divisions and drug-dominated
crime problems.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants in the SEC case include the city's former
city manager and its former director of finance, who deny any
wrongdoing.

PROPOSED DEAL WOULD DELAY COSTLY FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; total rewrite)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Alaska, Texas)  (lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key members of Congress who met in secret Wednesday
night to weigh the fate of the Air Force's $70 billion F-22 fighter
jet program said they had sketched out a deal to delay production
of the plane by a year until it passes more flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended without a final agreement. But Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., who persuaded the House to take the unusual step
of denying the Air Force $1.8 billion to buy the first six F-22s,
said the still-developing deal would prevent the purchase of those
planes next year.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of a deal over the F-22 call for ``testing first,
and avoiding a rush to failure,'' Lewis said. The proposed
compromise would neither kill the program nor give it full life,
but would extend its incubation by a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's
military spending panel, said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the
Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, offered
a deal in which some of the $1.8 billion would be shifted to more
research and development of the F-22. Little or no money would be
spent to start up full-scale production of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a key concession won almost single-handedly by
Lewis. Republican senators, backed by the White House, senior House
Republicans, the Air Force and the plane's prime contractor,
Lockheed Martin Corp., wanted all of the money restored to build
the planes as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing will be at the forefront,'' Lewis said. ``We will have
a pause in procurement.'' That means no F-22 would be produced in
2000. The Air Force has argued that a pause would kill the F-22
program.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators were still far apart on how much money would be
spent on the aircraft next year. The Senate's bill called for a
total of $3 billion, with $1.8 billion for procurement, or buying
planes, and $1.2 billion for research and development, or testing
parts and prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force already has spent close to $25 billion developing
the F-22, but has completed only about 5 percent of the necessary
flight tests. Over the next decade, it plans to spend $40 billion
or more building 339 of the aircraft. That puts the price tag of
each F-22 at close to $200 million, making it the costliest fighter
jet ever conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who argued that the plane is too expensive and too
untested to be built as planned, persuaded the House this summer to
support a one-year pause in production of the F-22, so that the Air
Force and the Pentagon could reconsider plans to build three new
fighter jets in the coming decade, at a total cost of $350 billion
_ a sum far greater than the annual Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's negotiations came in the opening round of a
House-Senate conference on the Pentagon spending bill for fiscal
year 2000, which begins Oct. 1. The final bill could total as much
as $270 billion, half the money Congress will appropriate to run
every agency of the government.
</P>
<P>
   According to several senators and representatives who were
present for the negotiations, Lewis offered to support production
of two F-22s, and Stevens countered with an offer to put most of
the $3 billion into further research and development of the plane,
with a fraction set aside to begin actually building it.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides were still not on the same wavelength for most
of the three-and-a-half hour meeting, participants said. Lewis was
talking about the number of aircraft to be built, while Stevens was
talking about the amount of money to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The two will meet again Thursday morning to try to pin down a
deal. Some bargain on the F-22 must be reached before the
negotiators agree on a Pentagon spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to back Lewis' plan to spend the $1.8 billion on
other, less expensive aircraft, and Speaker Dennis Hastert
initially supported that idea. But Air Force officials managed to
change Hastert's mind, and he ordered Lewis to find a way to
restore some of the money for the F-22, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 has also been strongly supported by the House Majority
Leader, Rep. Dick Armey, and the Majority Whip, Rep. Tom DeLay.
Both are Texas Republicans; many billions for the F-22 program
would be spent at Lockheed Martin's plant in Fort Worth, Texas.

NEW YORK CITY GETS UNLIKELY RECOGNITION: TRAFFIC SAFETY AWARD
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ill.)  (Eds: Neel cq in last graf before optional material.) 
(nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now, under the heading of ``Who Would Have Thought?''
comes the American Automobile Association's 1999 award for traffic
safety, an honor bestowed on communities that cherish pedestrians,
abhor bad driving manners, help little old ladies cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   One is Mendota, Ill., population 7,100, self-declared ``World's
Greatest Little City,'' a town with one stoplight and no taxis, a
place where people ponder what kind of reflectors to put on farm
equipment, consider it impolite to honk and take safety seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a great big city, New York, population 7.3 million,
a place of horrific traffic and throngs of pedestrians that are
almost always in close touch. The kind of town where people view
traffic safety as a contradiction in terms and think blocking the
box is standing in front of the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be kidding!'' said Joe Scagluso, a computer
executive who works in Times Square, when informed Wednesday about
the city's new stature as a model of pedestrian safety. ``You take
your life in your hands out here,'' he said with little
exaggeration, as a line of trucks and taxis thundered past at 42nd
Street and Seventh Avenue, within inches of his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Down at Broadway and Houston, a quiet backwater compared to
midtown, Wolfgang Herrmann offered his own assessment. ``There are
always more cars,'' said Herrmann, 68, a retired salesman and
seasoned pedestrian. ``In a few years the city will be totally
kaput.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he'd find some major disagreement at AAA, the
nation's oldest and largest advocacy group for yes, drivers. It
will honor both New York and Mendota on Thursday with the group's
Distinguished Achievement Award _ not to be confused with its
Outstanding Achievement Award and Excellent Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has more traffic and more pedestrians than most
places in the world, but this is not a measure of congestion,''
said Mark Kulewicz, director of traffic engineering and safety for
the Automobile Club of New York, the regional branch of the
American Automobile Association. ``It's about safety,'' he said,
``And it turns out New York is a pretty walkable place. The
improvement has been dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   In sister city Mendota on Wednesday, news of the award came as
Mayor Steve Bowne was presiding over Farm Safety Week, an event he
described as typical in a broad effort to enhance traffic safety.
Farmers, he said, are being encouraged by the city to replace or
install bright reflectors on any equipment they drive into town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award speaks to a real commitment to safety, and not just
by the police,'' he said, adding that other programs, involving the
schools and parents, have been aimed at requiring children to wear
bicycle helmets, and instructing people how to properly use car
seats for infants.
</P>
<P>
   Bowne, clearly delighted to share the spotlight with New York,
offered a dash of his own big-city sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering if I can use this award to launch a campaign for
the Senate from New York,'' said Bowne, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, famous back home for cracking down on
jaywalking and erecting barricades in midtown to help out drivers,
received news of the award with his own big-city sense of humor.
``New York City is honored to receive this prestigious award, which
recognizes our national leadership in the area of traffic safety,''
he said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, the AAA said it determined its winners by
evaluating such data as pedestrian fatalities, seat belt use,
biking accidents and drunken driving. It singled New York out for
its steep drop in pedestrian fatalities: Based on police reports,
it said 179 pedestrians were killed in the city in 1998, a 51
percent drop in the eight years since 1990, when there were 366
pedestrian deaths. (One rather big footnote: Pedestrians still make
up about half those killed in the city's traffic accidents.)
</P>
<P>
   The group said the city deserved kudos for attacking such safety
problems with educational programs and police work
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted to recognize the vital and life-saving work
that is being done by the city of New York and the other award
winners,'' said Donald T. Phillips, president of the Automobile
Club of New York, who is to announce the group's selection of New
York and Mendota at a banquet in Rye Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their dedication to traffic safety cannot be surpassed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for pedestrian safety, suggesting that the American
Automobile Association's dedication to both sides of the story left
something to be desired, said the group had ignored serious safety
problems that remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city does deserve credit, but needs to widen its scope
from simply dealing with pedestrian education and drunken driving
to measures that reduce aggressive driving,'' said Neel Scott, the
campaign director for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy
group for pedestrians and bicyclists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the seeming chaos of city streets Wednesday, where
construction had converted many sidewalks into scaffold-covered
obstacle courses and pedestrians maneuvered clogged crosswalks,
many pedestrians reacted to the news of the award with
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just run you over,'' said Tone Christensen, a model on
her way to a haircut, who was interviewed at the corner of 42nd
Street and Seventh Avenue. Barely audible under the din of
construction and heavy trucks grinding over potholes, she stood out
in the crowd for her courage _ if not foolhardiness _ since she was
riding a bicycle through Times Square, and doing so without a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have just to watch very closely,'' said Ms. Christensen, a
native of Norway. ``The people in cars are so aggressive _ they are
very selfish, I think.''

ADVERTISING :  GENERAL MOTORS AIMING PITCHES TOWARD BLACK
CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors, the nation's largest advertiser, is
significantly increasing efforts to aim sales pitches at black
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which spent $2.1 billion on American advertising last year,
has signed an agreement with BET Holdings Inc. in Washington, owner
of media properties that include the Black Entertainment Television
cable network, Emerge and Heart &AMP; Soul magazines and BET Weekend, a
Sunday newspaper supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, for one year with options to renew, deepens a
relationship between GM and BET that has included traditional
elements like commercials and print ads. GM will also become
involved with BET.com, a Web site being started by BET with
partners like the Microsoft Corp. They will also cooperate in
entertainment marketing promotions that could, for instance, lead
to product placement of GM cars and trucks in movies produced by
BET.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is emblematic of two important trends that are
reshaping the advertising and media industries. One is the
increasing interest among mainstream advertisers in so-called
multicultural marketing aimed at fast-growing demographic groups
like black, Hispanic and Asian-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic automakers ``had the lion's share of the
African-American and Hispanic markets and lost that for various
reasons,'' Philip Guarascio, vice president for marketing and
advertising at the North American operations of GM in Detroit, said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``That business is available to get back,'' he added, ``and all
of us are very aggressive in trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Carr, executive vice president for broadcast media at BET,
praised GM for ``a tremendous step toward showing its commitment to
and value for the African-American consumer market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue is farther along in the last year than in the past
15,'' he added, referring to agitation by some to prod mainstream
marketers into spending more to reach minority consumers in
minority media.
</P>
<P>
   Such consumers ``have to be taken much more seriously, not as a
secondary target but as a primary target,'' Carr said, adding: ``In
places like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, Philly, if you
add up the African-American population, the Hispanic population and
the Asian population, they're not minorities anymore. They're
majorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You either get it now,'' Carr said, ``or get it later, when
your competitors are in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The other trend the deal typifies is the rise in what are known
as cross-media advertising packages, which are meant to provide
``one-stop shopping'' in the various properties owned by media
conglomerates. A primary reason given by the top executives of
Viacom Inc. and the CBS Corp. for their merger is the ability of a
combined Viacom to offer advertisers consumers of all ages in media
as disparate as television, radio, films, billboards and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   GM has signed a big cross-media agreement with units of Time
Warner Inc., as has the Dodge division of DaimlerChrysler AG Ford
Motor Co.'s cross-media deals include one with Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use BET's resources as a platform to create what I
call naturally intrusive marketing that starts connecting with
potential customers,'' Guarascio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-media in its purest form is just a dollar commitment,''
he added. ``This is more elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Guarascio said, rather than develop a TV program
simply because BET owns a cable network, ``we can come up with a
special on African-American Olympic hopefuls'' based on the GM
sponsorship of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an idea is big enough, we can take it outside BET,'' he
added, ``like making it part of our Warner Brothers venture.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for General Motors to increase its ad spending in
BET media by more than 50 percent. Guarascio and Carr declined to
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   According to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU NV, GM
has already been raising its budgets devoted to buying commercial
time on Black Entertainment Television. The company spent almost $4
million there in 1998, compared with $2.9 million in 1997.

PHILIP BROWNSTEIN, FEDERAL HOUSING ADVOCATE, DIES AT 82
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md.)  (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip N. Brownstein, a top federal housing administrator in the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations who fought discrimination by
builders and landlords and who expanded Depression-era housing laws
to widen home ownership among minority groups, died on Friday in a
hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Brownstein was named commissioner of the Federal
Housing Administration, which became part of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development when the department was created in
1965. He continued to serve as FHA commissioner and as assistant
secretary for housing in the new agency. Under his leadership,
federal housing policy broadened its reach to include previously
forgotten groups.
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein's influence persisted for 25 years after he left
office for a private law practice.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Housing Administration from 1963 to early 1969,
Brownstein administered an agency created during the Depression to
cope with bank foreclosures on homes. The agency insured mortgages,
thus giving banks the confidence to buy them. The cost of the
insurance, which was passed on to individual home buyers, ended up
being a very small part of their monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the original law, longer mortgages, of 30 and 40
years, began to be written, and the concept of home ownership was
saved. But as the principal author of amendments to the original
law, Brownstein strove to extend these benefits to blacks and other
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs involved subsidized loans to minority members
moving into white suburbs and urban slum areas. In such areas,
Brownstein argued, lending institutions should abandon the
``excessive caution'' that he said had thwarted ``restoration of
the inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   At his swearing-in ceremony, William C. Apgar, the current
housing commissioner, called Brownstein his model. ``I said that I
was honored to have a job he once held,'' Apgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ravitch, who worked as a private developer with
Brownstein in 1965 to develop a block in Harlem before holding
several high positions in New York's state government, said one of
Brownstein's major accomplishments was making sure insured home
loans were more widely available ``at probably the most prolific
period for the creation of new housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravitch said Brownstein was also an indefatigable champion of
New York City during its 1970s fiscal crisis when he worked to
rewrite mortgages on which the city had defaulted. ``It was worth
hundreds of millions of dollars to the city as that time,'' Ravitch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein was born in the farming town of Ober, Ind., where his
father was a shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   While in high school, Brownstein was forced to put aside his law
school ambitions after his father became ill. In 1934, he moved to
Washington, D.C., and worked as an assistant truck driver at the
Federal Housing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from George Washington University and received his
law degree from Columbus University, which later became part of
Catholic University. He also received a master's degree in law from
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, Brownstein served in the Marines in South
Carolina. After the war, he joined the Veterans Administration,
where he worked until 1963, administering the agency's housing loan
program. In that job, he first urged financial institutions to
consider human needs in lending decisions, saying this was the
basic intention of the veterans' home loan program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notice of intention to foreclose should not be given until
it is determined that no amicable solution exists,'' he said in a
speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy appointed Brownstein commissioner of
the Federal Housing Administration in 1963, and President Lyndon B.
Johnson added the title of assistant secretary for housing when HUD
was created.
</P>
<P>
   In those posts, in addition to pushing housing for the needy,
Brownstein worked to prevent the waste of federal money. In 1965,
for example, he sent auditors to 100 low-rent projects after
suspicions were raised that families earning more than the maximum
were living there.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Richard M. Nixon asked him to continue in his
housing posts, Brownstein left the government in 1969 to become a
private lawyer. He specialized in housing cases for developers and
others, but continued to be active in promoting affordable housing
for the poor and middle-class. From 1969 to 1996, he was director
of the National Housing Conference and was a director of the Center
for Housing Policy from 1993 until his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a committee or working group he didn't volunteer
to serve on,'' Apgar said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Esther, Brownstein is survived by a
son, Michael, of Rockville, Md., who is a research scientist and
Laboratory Chief at the National Institutes of Health. Like his
father, he has spent his career in the federal government. Three
granddaughters also survive him.

AFTER 14 YEARS OF STABILITY, VILLAGE VOICE IS UP FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Village Voice, the grizzled dean of alternative
newspapers, was put up for sale Wednesday by Stern Publishing,
ending a 14-year period when the contentious weekly's ownership
became uncharacteristically stable, its circulation
uncharacteristically buoyant and its profile uncharacteristically
low.
</P>
<P>
   The move makes The Voice and six other alternative weeklies
owned by Stern the latest baubles in the media industry bazaar, a
bazaar whose buyers are increasingly likely to come from unlikely
places.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to receive the financial data from Veronis,
Suhler &AMP; Associates _ the firm handling the sale _ are newspaper
companies, Internet companies, Wall Street investment firms and
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
   By far the greatest change during the Stern period was the
elimination of the cover price for The Voice in New York City. The
move proved to be a boon to circulation, which was 111,298 in April
of 1996, when the cover price was eliminated. At then end of 1998,
circulation was 250,961, including 23,232 paid copies bought or
mailed to areas outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that a sale would have any immediate
impact on the newsroom, where the editor, Donald H. Forst, presides
over a staff of 100 journalists. David Schneiderman, a former Voice
editor who is now the president of Stern Publishing and one of
those organizing the auction, said: ``Change is usual for me. I'm
not surprised by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern, the chief executive of Stern Publishing, whose
investments in real estate and stewardship of the Hartz Group have
made him hundreds of millions of dollars, decided to sell his
publishing interests earlier this summer, when it became clear to
him that none of his three children wanted to manage this part of
the family business, according to Schneiderman and two of Stern's
children.

   Andrea Stern, at 33 the youngest of Stern's children and the
only one who has worked in various capacities in publishing for the
last three years, said in an interview that she cared about the
business, but not as a life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've loved working at The Voice,'' said Ms. Stern, who is
currently creative marketing director at the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running the publishing business was never what I aspired to do
as my life's work,'' she added, ``even though it has been a
tremendous experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For senior Voice writers, like Nat Hentoff, changes in ownership
are nothing new, and they have seldom if ever been harbingers of
interference with the self-consciously iconoclastic enterprise,
which was founded in 1955 by a group including the novelist Norman
Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a place that responds well to rigidity,'' Hentoff
said.

TAHIA CARIOCA, 79, RENOWNED BELLY DANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tahia Carioca, the dancer often called the Marilyn Monroe of the
Arab world, died of a heart attack in a Cairo, Egypt, hospital on
Monday. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Carioca's parents were mortified when as a teen-ager she
took her beauty and talent to a Cairo nightclub to dance for
strangers, but it was the beginning of a journey that would make
her one of the world's most renowned belly dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hold of fundamentalist Islam on Egyptian society has
virtually wiped out public manifestations of her art, she was in
the end granted the official approval her parents withheld, as the
Egyptian culture minister, Farouk Hosni, led her funeral
procession.
</P>
<P>
   She married 14 different husbands and once slapped King Farouk
when he threw an ice cube down her dress. She had roles in more
than 300 movies and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond mere fame, she virtually defined the intricate,
pulsating art called raqs sharqi in Arabic nations but known in the
West as the belly dance since a promoter at the 1893 Chicago
World's Fair dreamed up the name.
</P>
<P>
   Belly dancers cover less territory than Western dancers,
concentrating instead on often minute movements, sometimes
emphasizing such tiny muscular articulations as a quivering lower
lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really liked watching her; she would draw you in,'' said
Morocco, the stage name of a New York dancer who was inspired by
Miss Carioca and herself became a leading international performer.
She recalled the intensity of Miss Carioca's musicality and her
grace.
</P>
<P>
   When another great Egyptian belly dancer, Samia Gamal, died in
1994, her funeral was officially ignored, Morocco said. Her style
of dancing was sometimes called coltish or kittenish, in contrast
to the strength and dignity of Miss Carioca's approach. Miss
Carioca used her many films to raise the status of Middle Eastern
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got it recognized as part of the Egyptian fine arts
landscape through her portrayals of it in movies,'' said Julie
Elliot, a belly dancer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area.
``She was a pioneer of modern oriental dance as it is done today.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Carioca, originally named Abla Mohammed Karim, was born in
1920. She studied dance at Ivanova Belly Dancing School in Cairo
before moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930s and '40s
version of Broadway. She took her stage names from the Brazilian
sambas she liked to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Carioca became one of the biggest stars at a Cairo
nightclub owned by Badia Massabni, a Lebanese woman. The club was
an elegant re-creation of a British music hall and was frequented
by both British colonial administrators and the local aristocracy.
Women as well as men were part of the audience. Dancers wore
elegant, bejeweled gowns, sometimes with bare midriffs and
sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   But the nice surroundings did not make belly dancing, something
that up until that time had been performed mainly at private
weddings and celebrations, publicly respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men would reject the trade and would never marry a female
performer,'' Karin van Nieuwkerk wrote in a 1995 book about
Egyptian dancers called ``A Trade Like Any Other'' and published by
the University of Texas Press.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco said, ``Women do not show themselves publicly outside
the family and, maybe, somebody they're going to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Miss Carioca married many interesting men, among them
a U.S. army officer whom she met during World War II, an actor and
a prominent playwright.
</P>
<P>
   That none of thd matches lasted long may have owed something to
her sometimes assertive personality, Morocco said. ``She was sort
of a big mouth,'' she said, ``but very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Carioca is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.
</P>
<P>
   Her first film was ``Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by Togo
Mizrahi. One of her most popular movies was ``Youth of a Woman,''
in which she played a landlady who seduces a naive, young peasant
student. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said the
film director Gulal Sharqawi.
</P>
<P>
   She gave up dancing in 1963 but as late as the mid-1980s ran her
own theater in Cairo, helping to write and choose plays, as well as
directing and producing.
</P>
<P>
   She took to wearing the Islamic head scarf before retiring
completely from public view 13 years ago.

(ATTN: S.C.)  
 THOMAS E. ATKINS, 78, LONE PRIVATE WHO REPELLED A JAPANESE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas E. Atkins, who as an Army private in World War II
received the Medal of Honor for repelling a Japanese attack on his
infantry platoon in the Philippines while he was severely wounded,
died Sept. 15 at his home in Inman, S.C. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Bobby said.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins killed at least 14 enemy soldiers in the battle for a
Japanese mountaintop stronghold in March 1945.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. forces recaptured Manila, the Japanese commander in
the Philippines, Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, retreated with 140,000
soldiers to the Central Cordillera and Caraballo mountain ranges of
northern Luzon island, where he hoped to tie up U.S. forces needed
for invasions nearer the Japanese home islands. Yamashita's troops
dug in at mountain passes guarding the Cagayan Valley, where crops
could feed them for months.
</P>
<P>
   The 32nd Infantry Division, which was among three U.S. Army
divisions assigned to dislodge the Japanese, moved up to the
mountain passes along the Villa Verde Trail, a twisting footpath.
The terrain was heavily forested, but there were enough open areas
to give Japanese defenders, many hidden in caves, clear fields of
fire at almost every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was combined mountain and tropical warfare at its
worst,'' the 32nd Division's official report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfc. Thomas Eugene Atkins of Company A, 127th Infantry Regiment,
32nd Division, was in a foxhole on a ridge outside his platoon's
perimeter defense in the early hours of March 10 when two companies
of Japanese attacked with rifle and machine-gun fire, grenades and
TNT charges. Atkins was wounded in the hip, leg and back, and the
two soldiers alongside him were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pain from deep wounds, Atkins returned heavy fire and
repulsed the first attack, and then, instead of retreating to the
rear lines for medical aid, remained in his position. An enemy
machine gun, set up within 20 yards of his foxhole, blazed away as
the Japanese continued their assault.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins held them off, firing 400 rounds from his own rifle and
those of the two dead soldiers beside him. At 7 a.m., four hours
after the firefight began, 13 Japanese soldiers lay dead in front
of his position.
</P>
<P>
   By then, all three of Atkins' rifles had jammed, so during a
lull he withdrew to get another rifle and more ammunition. He was
persuaded to remain for medical treatment, but when he spotted a
Japanese soldier within the platoon's lines, he grabbed a rifle and
killed him. A few minutes later, while lying on a litter, Atkins
saw a group of enemy soldiers moving up behind the platoon's lines.
He sat up and delivered heavy rifle fire, which forced the Japanese
to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Atkins' action, the platoon was able to hold its
lines although outnumbered. The 32nd Infantry Division produced
four Medal of Honor winners in its six-week ascent over the 20
miles of the Villa Verde Trail, but it took U.S. troops until the
end of June to seize the Cagayan Valley and its food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, 1945, having been promoted to corporal, he was among
14 servicemen who received the Medal of Honor from President Harry
S. Truman at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, a native of Campobello, S.C., left military service soon
afterward and became a farmer. He is survived by his wife, Vivian;
four sons, Bobby, Ansel and Allen, of Inman, and Doug, of
Campobello; a daughter, Frances Crocker of Inman; two brothers,
Clyde, of Chesnee, S.C., and Hollis, of Oakbridge, Ga.; two
sisters, Lula Guffey of Duncan, S.C., and Pauline Mills of Inman;
eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

MEDIMMUNE TO ACQUIRE U.S. BIOSCIENCE FOR $492 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Md., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medimmune Inc., a biotechnology company, said Wednesday that it
had agreed to acquire U.S. Bioscience Inc. in a stock swap valued
at about $492 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bioscience, based in West Conshohocken, Pa., is developing
drugs for cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation sweeping the
biotechnology industry. Increasingly, large pharmaceutical
companies, as well as some of the few profitable biotechnology
concerns, are buying up smaller companies to add new drug
candidates to their product pipelines. For companies like
Medimmune, which has seen its share price more than quadruple this
year, such deals are less costly and less risky than developing new
drugs from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The year began with Warner-Lambert's announcement on Jan. 26
that it would pay $2.1 billion for Agouron Pharmaceuticals, a San
Diego company with a single marketed AIDS drug and a cancer
research program. Since then, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn has bought Sugen
Inc., Abbott Laboratories has bought Alza, which had itself
acquired Sequus, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson has acquired Centocor.
Analysts say there will be many more such deals because drug
companies are pressured to increase earnings faster than they can
develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Medimmune, which is based in Gaithersburg, Md., closed
Wednesday at $109.25, up $7.1875, on Nasdaq. Shares in U.S.
Bioscience, closed at $14.125, up $2.625, on the American Stock
Exchange. Under terms of the deal, Medimmune will exchange 0.15
share of its stock for each Bioscience share.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition further solidifies Medimmune's commitment to
the field of oncology,'' Wayne T. Hockmeyer, Medimmune's chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement. ``It will provide us with
three marketed products in the fields of oncology and infectious
disease, as well as development capabilities and an oncology sales
and marketing infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1988, Medimmune has specialized in drugs for
infectious diseases and organ transplants. Earlier this year the
company expanded its strategic focus to include cancer products
with the acquisition of Vitaxin. A genetically-engineered antibody
designed to prevent tumors from growing by restricting their blood
supply, Vitaxin is now in the second of the three phases of
clinical trials typically required for new drugs by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bioscience's product portfolio includes Ethyol, which is
approved for the reduction of cumulative kidney toxicity associated
with repeated chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
and non-small cell lung cancer. In June, the drug was also approved
by the FDA for use in the reduction of chronic dry mouth in
patients undergoing radiation treatment for head and neck cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other products include NeuTrexin, which is used to treat
moderate-to-severe pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with
compromised immune systems and is in clinical development for
metastatic colorectal cancer, and Hexalen, a chemotherapy used to
treat patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer.
Lodenosine is in clinical trials with the potential to treat HIV
infection.

TIME HAS COME FOR NFL CURRICULUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you watch college football on television, you're guaranteed
to see it. A guy will make a nice play, his mug will pop up on the
screen and below that his height, weight and class will appear
this: Major _ Undeclared.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for intentional grounding? You don't have to be a
Rhodes scholar to scoff at the illogic of it all. Next to ``We
follow the NCAA rules to the letter,'' it's the biggest lie in
college sports, the notion that any football player in a top-25
program enrolls in school without a clue what he wants to do with
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Show us a Division I starter who hasn't planned on playing
professional football since he was knee-high to a tackling dummy
and we'll show you a player who came late to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Football players enroll in college to pursue a B.A. all right _
a bachelor of athletics. Art history, public policy, gender
studies; academic beards, all. It's silly, making these
student-athletes hide their true ambitions just for the sake of
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Damn the deceit. If athletes intend to matriculate to the NFL,
there is plenty they'll need to know. Goodness knows there are
enough classes to keep them eligible. So just give them their own
major, already. For those studying pre-NFL, we recommend the
following core curriculum:
</P>
<P>
   __ Practical chemistry _ The bulky syllabus includes voluminous
discussion of anabolic steroids, Androstenedione and human growth
hormone. Masking agents also are uncovered and explored.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Class is pass/fail. Final exam is an urinalysis; pass it
and pass the course.
</P>
<P>
   __ Real life 101 _ Not an MTV course. Every week, students
accompany different blue-collar workers to their jobs, to see what
life is like for those lacking 4.2 speed in the 40.
</P>
<P>
   Required course materials: Hard hat, hair net, bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   __ Marketing No. 1 _ Noted expert Brian Bosworth teaches
students the tricks to attaining fame whether or not they've got
game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Modern literature _ Students write their autobiographies, as
told to their athletic department tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Required text: ``Give Me the Damn Ball'' by Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jurisprudence for jocks _ Students study the pros and cons of
various criminal defenses. Misdemeanors, felonies and paternity
suits are explained in full.
</P>
<P>
   Guest lecturers include Jim Brown and Dave Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   __ Broadcasting for puns and profit _ Students learn to recite
cliches, read from a teleprompter, use a telestrator and act like
pompous fools.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pre-draft math _ Plugging in different sets of statistics,
students calculate Ricky Williams' 1999 salary.
</P>
<P>
   __ Advanced surfing _ Students build their own Web sites to open
up new windows of communication and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Course Fee: $70, cost per student to register names and
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   __ Humanitarianism for beginners _ An independent study course.
Students spend four hours a week caring about somebody other than
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The final exam is an essay. Students are marked down for
every ``I'' they use.
</P>
<P>
   __ Theology 300 _ Students explore the question: Does God really
decide who wins between the 49ers and the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   __ Managing the media _ Students are schooled in how to answer
any question blandly, even if the reporter is wearing a funny hat
or feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The final is an extemporaneous oral exam. Each student is
asked an outrageous question in front of the class and is graded on
the civility and insipidity of his response.
</P>
<P>
   __ Anger management _ The point is beaten into the ground that
people are not punching bags. Students explore healthful outlets
for their rage and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Guest lecturers include Dan Wilkinson and Lawrence Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Above course is best taken in conjunction with:
</P>
<P>
   __ Weight-training for the soul _ Heavy self-examination
facilitates students in lifting the chips off their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Introduction to sociology _ Self-proclaimed expert Reggie
White lectures on the melting pot that is the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going deep _ An analytical-reasoning class in which students
tackle issues such as, why does the NFL court beer distributors as
major sponsors and then act so shocked when players turn up with
drinking problems?
</P>
<P>
   Moderator: Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   That about covers it. It's a heavy workload, to be sure. But
whether students have their eyes on the sheepskin or the pigskin,
they've got to stay on the ball.

DESPITE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS, THE METS CAN'T WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There would be no dramatics, no questions about why
the Mets chose to pitch to one of the Braves' main offensive
threats on Wednesday night. This loss was simpler to explain and
much harder to take, ending not with a bomb but with a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mets' 5-2 loss to the Braves _ their second defeat in a
row and the sixth in eight games against Atlanta this season _ the
unraveling was not done by a most valuable player candidate but by
the Mets' own failure to squeeze out even a single run after
loading the bases in an eighth inning laden with frantic
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the same. The Braves have proved in the first two
games of this pivotal series that despite struggling through their
closest division race in seven years, they still possess the finely
honed capacity to choke the bubbling hope out of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   With the lss, the Mets dropped three games behind the Braves in
the National League East and face the ignominious possibility of
being swept for the first time since the All-Star Game break when
Al Leiter faces Greg Maddux on Thursday afternoon. The Mets still
have the wild card to fall back on, and that seems like a much more
likely landing spot. The Mets still led the wild-card race by three
games over the Reds, who were playing a late game in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves took a 3-2 lead in the seventh, when the bottom
of the order began slapping singles about the field, the Mets had
their best threat of the series. Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura
singled to start the eighth inning. After a Braves pitching change
to bring in Mike Remlinger, Melvin Mora _ the first of a series of
pinch-hitters _ came to the plate for Benny Agbayani. Mora bunted,
moving Piazza and Ventura over.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston was announced as the next pinch-hitter for Darryl
Hamilton, but after Russ Springer came on to pitch, Bobby Valentine
inserted Matt Franco instead. He was intentionally walked to load
the bases. That brought Bobby Bonilla, who had smashed a pinch hit
double Tuesday night, to the plate to hit for Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. First, the Braves would bring in Terry Mulholland
to pitch to Bonilla and Valentine would send Jay Payton in to run
for Matt Franco. He took the first pitch for a ball, then fouled
off the next two to go down 1-2. He swung on the fourth pitch he
saw to strike out. Todd Pratt _ the fifth pinch hitter _ was next,
pinch hitting for pitcher Orel Hershiser. He grounded out weakly to
end the inning, the Mets using everyone except the equipment
manager in an astounding show of futility.
</P>
<P>
   They have tried to pitch Chipper Jones away and they have tried
to jam him inside. With each little move their pitchers make, the
Mets, like men trying to wriggle free of quicksand, sink just a
little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Mets went at Jones again, hoping that this
time the pitch would squeeze somewhere outside what seemed to be
Jones' enormous hitting zone, that an intentional walk was really
not necessary to neutralize the danger of the Braves' best player.
Jones had hit two home runs Tuesday night, and it was reasonable to
wonder why the Mets would even pitch to him.
</P>
<P>
   But they did, and they paid for it. Orel Hershiser sent a
fastball high and inside in the first inning, and Jones slammed
another home run to give the Braves a 2-0 lead and created perhaps
the best argument for the Mets to not let him get anywhere near the
batter's box again.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, the Braves would look just as foolish
facing a slugger. Piazza had eked out just one hit Tuesday night,
but he has bludgeoned Tom Glavine in the past. Piazza entered the
game batting .389 against Glavine (14 for 36) with three home runs.
Finally, it was time for the Braves to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza worked the count to 2-2 in the fourth, with John Olerud
on first. Glavine tried to work a pitch past Piazza, but the ball
stayed up and over the plate. Piazza belted it to left field for
his 37th home run of the year and a tie score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, a former Cy Young award winner like Tuesday's starter
John Smoltz, is not the same pitcher this season. In his last
start, Glavine allowed four runs and eight hits in just five
innings. He is just 11-11 this season, with an unusually high
earned run average of 4.35.
</P>
<P>
   With Greg Maddux still to come, the Mets knew that this might be
their best opportunity to take a game from the Braves. Countering
with Orel Hershiser, the Mets could rely on getting at least six
strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   What they could not have anticipated was that, except for the
home runs, Hershiser would engage Glavine in the second quickly
paced pitchers' duel in as many nights. After giving up the home
run and then walking Ryan Klesko, Hershiser retired the next 11
batters on a variety of grounders and pop-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves barely mounted a threat in the bottom of the fifth,
when Eddie Perez singled up the middle. But Walt Weiss struck out
and Piazza sent a one-hop throw to Rey Ordonez that got Perez at
least two feet from second base. Glavine struck out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Hershiser hit Gerald Williams in the back.
Williams was on first when Jones came up. Hershiser had got Jones
to ground out weakly in the third. His first two pitches were away.
His second was not. Jones made contact, but the fly ball settled
softly into Rickey Henderson's glove. Hershiser then made an
acrobatic spinning catch of Ryan Klesko's hopper to the mound to
end that inning, too.

QUIETLY, JOHNSON LIFTS UP THE REDSKINS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ Brad Johnson's world has been flat, round and
steep all in one, a kid who grew up in the mountains of North
Carolina, living to play basketball but winding up a quarterback,
at first a wounded one and then a star.
</P>
<P>
   He was unknown at Florida State, where he started six games and
was the 14th quarterback selected in the 1992 draft. He was
inactive for the Minnesota Vikings for two years, sped to the World
League, came back as a big-time Vikings starter, went back to being
a backup, then became a starter again and then a backup again, all
the time suffering injuries from neck to ankle to thumb to knee.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Washington Redskin, some of his teammates say of Johnson,
``It's Brad's World.''
</P>
<P>
   They say he seems to be in his own time zone, his own space,
with a mind that they have been unable to unlock. He does not rant
in the middle of the huddle or the locker room. He enters and
leaves in his pigeon-toed stroll with few knowing more about him.
He says especially little to the defensive players. He does talk
more one on one, though, picking his spots, finding his way and
creating his own nook since being acquired on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In that whirlwind trade, the Vikings received three draft picks:
a first-round choice (11th overall) and a third-round pick in
April's draft and a second-round pick in next year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here for his news conference with the Redskins
showcasing their three Super Bowl trophies. Get the hint? The
Redskins have given up plenty for Johnson. Some said too much.
</P>
<P>
   But not Darrell Green, the 17-year cornerback who is one of the
Redskins' staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids we had here before, and I mean K-I-D-S,'' he said,
spelling for emphasis, ``they came at a time playing quarterback
for us when there was so much going on in the staff, management,
coaching, new players, at the beginning of a whole era. I'm talking
about Heath Schuler and Gus Frerotte and Trent Green. Great guys,
but not prepared for the scrutiny of the situation and not allowed
to grow. Brad Johnson magnifies that. This is a pro. A
professional. This guy can look at five receivers on every play. A
professional at his position who knows what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two weeks of pro football, across the league, it has
been Brad's World.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ranks first in quarterback passer rating (129.5). He has
thrown five touchdown passes and no interceptions. He has passed
for 613 yards. He has completed 65.6 percent of his passes. Under
his direction, the Redskins have gained more first downs (53) and
scored more points (85) than any team.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday he helped Washington score 50 points against the
Giants. In this week's version of New York, New York, the Redskins
(1-1) return to Giants Stadium to play the Jets (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   In Brad's World the snaps are clean, the setups in the pocket
are quick, the pass protection is rigid, the scene develops quickly
for him, all receivers are open, passes are perfect, receivers
catch it, drives roll. And roll. And roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing ain't all me,'' Johnson said Wednesday afternoon at
the Redskins' practice facility. ``I've had some success and so has
the team, and we're all trying to build on it. The perception of
what a quarterback should be is not all yelling and standing up in
the middle of the room getting attention. A leader does his work
and does it right and then watches everyone get on board. This team
needed a new direction. You look up there on the walls and there's
Joe Theismann who played here, and I tell you, he's a different
person than me. But there are a lot of different ways to skin a
cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad's World? That's actually kind of accurate. I'm an
easygoing person. I'm quiet. But I'll do anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a survivor who flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turned 31 last week, toiled through more than half
a season in his second year at Minnesota in which he did not even
dress for games. ``I knew I wasn't a good football player,'' he
said, ``but I thought one day if things come together I could play
in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned his way into uniform as a backup to Warren Moon and
then asked the Vikings in 1995 to send him to the World League.
Many quarterbacks run from the World League, but Johnson ran toward
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to go because I knew I needed to play,'' he said. ``It
worked out. I learned how to become more assertive there. I had to
be creative, speak up for myself, for the team, take some chances
with the offense. I wouldn't say I went there immature, but I did
go there as an immature quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got a break in 1996 when Moon was injured, and he played
beautifully (2,258 yards, 17 touchdowns in 12 games). The next
season he started 13 games _ 3,036 yards and 20 touchdowns _ before
injury hit. Last year he lost his job, for good, to Randall
Cunningham after more injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the perception that I didn't play well or that I wasn't
able to compete in Minnesota,'' Johnson said. ``But I give the
coaches and the people there credit because they stayed with me in
the early years; they gave me a chance to learn, and they saw
something in me. They knew I was willing to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Sam Shade said: ``We've got plenty of guys who talk a
lot. I think Brad is more like me. I just got here from Cincinnati,
him from Minnesota, so we want to get things done before you start
talking a lot and telling people how to get up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 6 feet 5 inches, 224 pounds, and he is 16-9 as a
National Football League starter. He has thrown 49 career touchdown
passes, 29 interceptions. He has sparkled before, just not
consistently because of injury and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Norv Turner, the Redskins' head coach, said Johnson is sharp in
the film room and translates that onto the field. Turner said that
Johnson improvises during games and that ``our whole team is
feeding of him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Westbrook, the big-play receiver, said that he and
Johnson talk all the time, even in the huddle, about how to run a
pass route and about what each other expects.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a grip on the offense. He releases the ball quickly.
He scrambles looking for receivers. He knows what he is doing, his
teammates say.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if he continues leading the Redskins to victories, Brad's
World will easily become their World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an opportunity and I've tried to be prepared for it
and hit it,'' Johnson said. ``My goal is not to have 53 friends on
the team, but my goal is to gain respect for them and for myself
and this organization. I used to pull for this organization as a
kid; they were my favorite team. It's been some down times here
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about some of the bad times that happened for me,
during them, I kept busy looking to see what good would happen
next. A lot quarterbacks, a lot of players have been cut and traded
and bounced back. We've got a group here that can do something big.
I want to be a big part of that.''

EDITORIAL: TOBACCO BECOMES A FEDERAL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lawsuit against the tobacco industry
may prove a critical moment in the fight against smoking if it
forces the industry to stop marketing cigarettes to children and
agree to greater federal regulation. Congress, unable to wean
itself from campaign contributions from the tobacco industry,
refused last year to curb the industry's devious marketing
practices or to give the Food and Drug Administration authority to
regulate tobacco and nicotine. That has left the Clinton
administration no choice but to seek change through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The potential costs of this suit to the industry are crippling,
which may give the industry a powerful incentive to settle on the
government's terms. The lawsuit seeks monetary recovery for the
more than $20 billion a year that the federal government spends on
treating people with smoking-related diseases under federal health
programs. The government is also seeking any ill-gotten profits
made through fraud and misrepresentations. Equally important, it
asks for permanent injunctions against industry deceptions about
the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has long understood, through its own research, that
smoking can cause disease and death and that nicotine is addictive.
Yet it carried out a relentless national campaign of falsehoods
designed to cast doubt on those very questions. The conspiracy of
lies has been documented in thousands of incriminating documents
unearthed in litigation brought by the state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the industry agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion over
25 years. Four other states had earlier reached settlements
totaling $40 billion. The state settlements also included
restrictions on outdoor advertising and the use of promotional
products to lure children to the smoking habit. But much remains to
be done to curb teen-age smoking and to help millions of addicted
smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should give the Justice Department the $20 million it
has requested in the fiscal year 2000 budget to pursue this case.
The industry will likely spend much more than that fighting the
suit. Billions of dollars ride on the outcome. But it is the
nonmonetary controls that could help reduce smoking's annual death
toll of 400,000 Americans.

PANEL PICKS DAY TO BEGIN TEST OF PRICING STOCKS IN DECIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A securities industry trade group has chosen what is
certain to be one of Wall Street's slowest trading days of next
year to begin the process of converting stock prices to decimals
from fractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities Industry Association, whose members include Wall
Street investment banks, brokerage firms and mutual fund companies,
said yesterday that it would ask securities regulators to approve a
three-phase conversion process that would begin Monday, July 3,
with a one-month pilot test involving about 40 securities.
</P>
<P>
   Those 40 securities, which have yet to be chosen but which will
include stocks on all of the major equity markets, will have their
prices quoted in minimum increments of 5 cents. Currently, most
stock prices move in minimum increments of one-sixteenth of a
dollar, or 6.25 cents, and are quoted on trading terminals,
newspapers and other forums in fractions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, regulators and Wall Street firms have
been discussing the looming conversion of stock and option prices
to decimals, a move that many overseas markets have already made.
But the move has been put off until after the beginning of next
year to allow securities firms to prepare their computer systems
for the Year 2000 issue.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern of securities firms is that the conversion will
increase the number of quotes and orders so much that it might
overload exchanges' computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the association predicted that
converting to a system where stock prices are quoted and move in
increments of one penny at a time would increase by 80 percent the
number of trades taking place each day. In addition, the number of
quotes processed through the computer systems of market
participants would jump by 139 percent each day, while overall
share volume would increase by only 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A move to a minimum price increment of 5 cents, however, would
cause an increase of only 3.5 percent in the number of trades and
quotes, the study predicted. Wall Street has already found that by
quoting stock prices in sixteenths rather than eighths of a dollar,
the average number of trades each day has increased faster than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group's Decimal Steering Committee chose July 3 as the
date to begin the conversion project because Tuesday, July 4, is a
national holiday. Although the financial markets will be open on
July 3, many Wall Street professionals are likely to turn the first
weekend in July into a four-day holiday, making trading volume
light as the switch to decimals gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed timetable for the decimal conversion must be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Annette
Nazareth, director of market regulation at the SEC, lauded the
industry's effort to move along the switch to decimal pricing. But
in a statement issued Wednesday, she added, ``Although the staff is
open-minded regarding possible implementation phase-in plans, we
would obviously view with a critical eye any plan that
substantially delayed the ultimate implementation of decimal
pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, in the second phase of the proposed process, all
stocks and stock options would begin to be quoted in decimals and
traded in five-cent minimum increments. Eight weeks later, on Oct.
2, all securities could be quoted and traded in ``whatever
increments market forces determine,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in November, securities firms are expected to begin
internal testing of the ability of their computer systems to use
decimal pricing, followed by testing between firms in April and
May.

RESIDENTS NEAR U.S. LAB TAKE GERMS STUDY MATTER-OF-FACTLY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIENT POINT, N.Y. _ Plum Island doesn't look all that sinister
from here, a mile across open water.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the signs at the restricted ferry dock warn the curious to
keep their distance. And there have been plenty of rumors over the
years that the Agriculture Department's Animal Disease Center on
Plum Island is just a euphemistic front for black-budget research
into horrifyingly deadly substances like nerve gas, or anthrax, or
the hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   But few people have lost any sleep worrying about outbreaks. In
fact, residents seem to have become so dulled to the rumors that
facts hardly get them going.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it appeared Wednesday, upon the news that the government
plans to upgrade its super-secret laboratory on the tiny island to
study germs that can kill humans as well as cows and swine. The
plan is part of an effort by the Clinton administration to deter
so-called bioterrorists, who might use germs to attack American
crops or livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it here, where are they going to do it?''
said Pep Kalin, a retired water company official who was walking
along Route 25 in a stiff, cold wind. ``I've been living 49 years
here in Orient. Everybody talks about Plum Island, Plum Island,
Plum Island. But it hasn't bothered me yet. My father-in-law worked
there in maintenance, took 31 showers a day, every time he went
from one building to the next. Their operation doesn't bother me.
If you don't like it, get the hell out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   What was on people's minds Wednesday in Orient _ and in East
Marion, Greenport and the other hamlets along the North Fork where
many of Plum Island's 300 current workers live _ was money. The
Agriculture Department is asking for $75 million next year for the
project, and out-of-work mechanics, shopkeepers and local officials
all wondered aloud how soon those millions could begin trickling
into wallets, cash registers and tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
   At the 200-year-old Orient Country Store, Linton Duell, the
owner for the last 20 years, said he hoped that the more dangerous
pathogens being studied would mean more jobs for guards and cleanup
crews, the kinds of people who frequent his shop to pick up the
paper, take a load off at the lunch counter, nurse a cup of hot
coffee and catch up with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be done somewhere,'' Duell said of the sensitive
research on the island. ``I just hope they do it well. I hope the
security is up to standards. They'll probably be hiring for
security personnel. They were contracting it out to the lowest
bidder. But I'm not so sure that's the best policy when you're
talking about national security.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kapell, a real estate broker and the mayor of Greenport,
was practically ecstatic about the prospects for local development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be better for the area than to have a cutting-edge
technology developed right here?'' he said in the middle of lunch
with his wife, guessing that the project would create at least 50
new jobs right off the bat. ``This is exactly the kind of thing we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, might benefit. After all, he said, he had sold houses
to at least half a dozen Plum Island scientists over the years.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen new jobs could provide quite a lift, Kapell said.
Plum Island remains one of the North Fork's largest employers, but
only because industry of any kind is scarce. The animal research
center, which opened in the early 1950s on the 840-acre island, was
dramatically cut back in the late '70s or early '80s. ``We saw the
virtual elimination of a whole class of residents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapell said he was not completely overlooking the danger of the
proposed changes at Plum Island. ``There's always concern, every
time you have a potentially deadly activity,'' he said. ``But it's
got to be considered in the light of 50 years of history of a safe
operation. I've known enough of the scientists over the years to
know that these are very legitimate, highbrow researchers. And,
personally, I have faith in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kapell drives a car with official plates. He is the
government.
</P>
<P>
   There are more skeptical types, like an older man who was
walking along the deserted central street of a subdivision of large
summer homes that have a clear view of Plum Island. ``Our secret
government,'' he said, reading a newspaper headline, then added,
``You never know what they're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   As a flock of starlings took flight before him, the man, who
refused to give his name, said he worried about birds flying over
to Plum Island and picking up deadly germs. ``I'd love to see that
place shut down,'' he said.

REALNETWORKS, REALJUKEBOX AND FINALLY, IT SEEMS, REAL MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.) (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Realjukebox is starting to earn some real money
for its developer, Realnetworks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Realnetworks, a Seattle company that makes software for sending
audio and video over the Internet, will announce a series of
alliances on Thursday with companies that will sell products or
provide information to users of Realjukebox, a software product
that allows people to copy, store and play music from compact disks
on their personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Checkout.com, the new Internet entertainment Web site co-founded
by Hollywood talent manager Michael Ovitz, will become the
exclusive online vendor of compact disks and provider of
entertainment information for users of Realjukebox. Another
company, 800.com, will be the exclusive seller of electronic
products, while MP3.com will provide music that users of
Realjukebox can download free.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deals are not being disclosed. But industry
executives said that Checkout.com would pay Realnetworks at least
$8 million; the two other deals are somewhat smaller. Together the
deals would represent a nice lift for Realnetworks, which had
revenues in its latest quarter of $28 million and a net loss of
$270,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realnetworks is getting to a new level of scale in terms of
the impact we have and our ability to derive economic benefit from
it,'' said Rob Glaser, the company's chairman and chief executive.
He said income from the agreements would be spread over several
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Realjukebox, which can be downloaded for free over the Internet,
has gained 10 million users since its introduction in May. The
software allows users to store music from compact disks on their
hard drives, to download music from the Web and to play back the
music on their personal computers or download it to new portable
digital music players.
</P>
<P>
   That large base of users is what made it attractive to
Checkout.com, a new entertainment service that hopes the deal will
drive users to its Web site as it fights to distinguish itself from
numerous other online music vendors. ``It's not like we're just
throwing some ad banners out there,'' said Richard Wolpert,
Checkout.com's acting chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Checkout.com, a privately held company based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., bills itself as an entertainment portal, providing
information on entertainment such as biographies and concert
reviews, in addition to selling compact disks. Its other big backer
is Ronald W. Burkle, a billionaire supermarket magnate. Ovitz and
Burkle have purchased several Internet companies to augment their
fledgling Internet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Realnetworks is also announcing a deal with Sony Music to allow
consumers who play a forthcoming album by Rage Against the Machine
on their computers using Realjukebox to download an unreleased
track of the band's live performance at Woodstock this summer.
Realjukebox users will also be able to preview three tracks from
the record about a month before its scheduled release in early
November.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements come as Realnetworks begins shipping the final
version of Realjukebox. The 10 million downloaded until now have
been beta versions.

EDITORAL: BASHING JOHN MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is a conservative Republican who favors tax
cuts and opposes abortions and most gun controls. So why are
right-wing groups like Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle
Association, the American Conservative Union and the Christian
Coalition saying terrible things about him? The answer is that
McCain is pushing for a ban on unregulated ``soft money'' donations
to political parties. These groups would not be affected by
McCain's legislation, but the Republican Party is urging them to
line up against it and help keep wavering Republican senators in
line.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House passed the Shays-Meehan reform bill,
clearing the way for a renewed drive in the Senate. The legislation
sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., is supported
by seven Republicans and all 45 Democrats, but it will take 60
votes to break the expected filibuster. Some Republicans who say
they want reform were not willing to break the filibuster because
of alleged concerns about the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold.
In the past, they cited the bill's proposal to regulate
advertisements in the last two months of a campaign by allegedly
independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   But last week McCain and Feingold dropped that part of the bill.
Even so, Americans for Tax Reform and allied independent groups
have been busy this week in New Hampshire and South Carolina
attacking McCain. They accuse him of being an enemy of free speech
and conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these absurd charges is clear. These groups are
not really independent. They are more like adjuncts of the
Republican Party and share the party leadership's desire to
preserve money-driven politics. For example, Americans for Tax
Reform, run by Grover Norquist, a pal of Newt Gingrich, actually
received $4.6 million from the GOP in 1996 and ran ads to help
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans say they decry the influence of
special-interest money in American elections. Among them is Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, who last year ran against Mitch McConnell for
the job as the Senate GOP's chief fund-raiser. He cited what he
said accurately was McConnell's abuse of power in raising soft
money. George Voinovich, newly elected senator from Ohio, has said
he would vote for a soft-money ban. But the pressure from the party
machine is so great that both men are waffling on the
McCain-Feingold soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for these senators to follow McCain's brave
example in rejecting money-driven politics. The attack on McCain
has nothing to do with conservative principles. It is an attempt to
cripple his presidential campaign because he has challenged the
grip of special-interest money across the political spectrum.

TEENS GATHER FOR PRAYERS AT SITE OF TRAGEDY

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Many young people dodged bullets inside
Wedgwood Baptist Church a week ago. Last night, hundreds were back
in the church praying and writing messages on the concrete floors,
vowing that fear and evil will not prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satan, you can't stop us,'' said a message near the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Another said, ``Our God is an Awesome God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Meredith, Wedgwood pastor, said he is humbled by the
courage the youth have shown since the shooting rampage, in which
Larry Gene Ashbrook fired more than 100 bullets during a See You at
the Pole youth rally. Ashbrook, 47, killed seven people and injured
seven others before taking his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred young people and adults met in three separate
groups last night, and those in the sanctuary were invited to write
messages on the concrete, which has been stripped of bloodstained
carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying that a spirit of fear doesn't overtake us,''
Meredith told about 200 people in the fellowship hall.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said later that writing the messages is a way for young
people to purge their grief. He said he is especially proud that
some wrote messages of forgiveness to the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Near the spot where Ashbrook committed suicide, one youth wrote:
``We don't hate you, Larry Ashbrook. We hate Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages included many statements of love for the people
killed.
</P>
<P>
   At the spot where children's choir director Sydney Browning was
slain, there were dozens of messages.
</P>
<P>
   Browning had T-shirts made for choir members bearing the
initials, ``TBCINT,'' an acronym for ``The Best Children's Choir in
North Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   One youngster wrote on the floor, ``Sydney We love you. Sing a
song for me in the TBCIH, meaning `The Best Children's Choir in
Heaven.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At all the doorways were declarations challenging Satan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satan I rebuke you from ever passing through these doors ever
again,'' one said. ``This is my Father's House. You have no place
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages will be covered when new carpeting is installed
this week. But one teen, who wrote a message to his slain best
friend, said that doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know they are still under there,'' said Matt Henson,
17.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fannin, the church youth director, said many young people
who survived the shooting had feared going into the church again.
But they have gradually overcome the fears, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in a grieving and healing process, though,''
Fannin said.
</P>
<P>
   A church member who requested anonymity was inside yesterday,
filling in bullet holes and shrapnel marks from a pipe bomb and
painting the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said that one Metroplex church took an offering and
donated $42,000 to the Wedgwood church. The donor congregation
asked not to be named, Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he received a call from President Clinton this week
offering condolences and inviting Meredith to the White House for a
prayer breakfast. Meredith had to decline because of a previous
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reached Meredith on his car phone as Meredith drove to
the Monday afternoon graveside service for Cassie Griffin, a
14-year-old shooting victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was very sympathetic and talked about the recent
tragedies in different parts of the country which were caused by
troubled individuals,'' Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-minute call, Meredith said, Clinton expressed
concern about increasing gun violence and said he hopes to discuss
with Meredith how churches can reach angry, frustrated loners who
might commit such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said that at the end of the conversation, he prayed for
Clinton and his family after asking the president's permission.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor also told church members last night that proposals
for a memorial have been made by the architect who is supervising
an expansion at the church. Church members voted to appoint a
committee to study the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The architect, Bill Petrelli of Arlington, has designed a
memorial that would honor the shooting victims and include the
message that the forces of darkness will not prevail over the
light, Meredith said. The octagonal structure would include
waterfalls and a reflecting pool. Petrelli didn't charge for the
design, Meredith said.

EDITORIAL: THE CLEMENCY CONTROVERSY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   In offering clemency to 16 jailed Puerto Rican nationalists, did
President Clinton endanger the safety of the American people? That
is the question posed by the release this week of a strongly worded
letter to Congress from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
letter states that the FBI opposed clemency because it would return
hardened terrorists to the clandestine movement for Puerto Rican
independence and would ``psychologically and operationally
enhance'' the criminal activities of terrorist groups. Clinton will
need to answer these contentions, as they form the core of law
enforcement objections to his act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The president took an important, if belated, step on Tuesday to
try to quell the swirling controversy. In a five-page letter to
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House
committee investigating the decision, Clinton provided his first
detailed explanation of the evidence and arguments that persuaded
him to make this rare use of his clemency power.
</P>
<P>
   The nub of his case was that none of the prisoners at issue were
``convicted of crimes involving the killing or maiming of any
individuals,'' and that the sentences they received were unduly
severe _ as many as 90 years in some cases _ for what they had
done. These are compelling arguments that led religious and
humanitarian leaders to call for clemency and led this page to
conclude there was a basis for clemency in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has not adequately explained how he concluded that
the release posed no danger to the public. He said he took
seriously the opposition voiced by law enforcement officials and
made clemency conditional on a prisoner obeying regular statutory
parole requirements and renouncing violence. But he must answer
criticisms that such vows can be broken and that the mere presence
of a released nationalist can stir other terrorists toward
violence. Even acknowledging that the FBI has seldom seen a
terrorist it is willing to release, the agency has raised issues
that need a public answer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the widely held suspicion that Clinton's clemency
decision was influenced by the senatorial ambitions of his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president said the timing was due to
the imminent departure of his former counsel, Charles Ruff, and the
decision was not tailored to please an important New York voting
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Clinton's version of all these matters is true, he
should be willing to release the pertinent White House files.
Although the president constantly abused executive privilege when
trying to shield embarrassing information about Whitewater and his
affair with Monica Lewinsky, he may be on strong legal ground in
asserting privilege this time to resist a House subpoena for the
pardon documents. Under the Constitution, the power to pardon or
grant clemency is solely the president's. But this is a situation
that calls for maximum candor. Clinton's letter of explanation,
welcome though it is, is no substitute for full disclosure. As
Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University School of Law
suggested in an Op-Ed article in the Times on Monday, it should be
possible to strike a deal in which Congress agrees to drop its
subpoena in exchange for Clinton's voluntarily providing the
relevant White House documents.

BREAK FELLS POLI-DIXON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bad news continued Wednesday for the beleaguered
UCLA Bruins, who announced junior split end Brian Poli-Dixon is
probably out for the season after breaking his right wrist against
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's bad luck or cosmic retribution for the
disabled-parking scam _ exploit the handicapped, and bad karma's
sure to follow _ the Bruins now have lost three players for the
season: Poli-Dixon, defensive end Travor Turner and offensive
tackle Josh Webb.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, reserve freshman linebacker Asi Faoa might be lost
for the year because of a back injury suffered Tuesday, starting
cornerback Jason Bell is out indefinitely with a bad heel, and
starting quarterback Cory Paus is out at least a week because of
bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Combine Poli-Dixon's injury with receiver Danny Farmer's
lingering ankle sprain and receiver Freddie Mitchell's nagging knee
sprain, and the Bruins are suddenly vulnerable at what was
considered their strongest position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (defensive coordinator) Bob Field about it _
we're a beat-up team,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``Our
receivers were supposed to be the best in the country and now we're
beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jon Dubravac, who was expected to redshirt, will
replace Poli-Dixon as the No. 2 split end behind Brad Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon was one of UCLA's top playmakers. He caught 10 passes
for touchdowns last year despite a sprained left wrist, and he has
eight catches in three games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the first quarter, when he braced himself
after flipping over on a tackle. He played the rest of the game,
dropped a pass and caught a touchdown pass, then practiced Monday
and Tuesday. He complained of pain, however, and X-rays Wednesday
revealed a break.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will request a medical redshirt for Poli-Dixon unless
he returns late in the season. Players may receive medical
redshirts if they do not play in more than three games. Toledo said
he'll request a medical redshirt for Faoa, as well, if he cannot
return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Farmer had his best practice of the season Tuesday.
His cuts were sharp and routes crisp. He felt just as good
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there,'' he said. ``I'm starting to get my
rhythm back. Tuesday was the first time in a while I've practiced
the whole time. I feel comfortable again being on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer also felt good last week _ until he tweaked the ankle
making a cut. Because it's the most serious type of sprain (above
the ankle bone), the Bruins worry Farmer won't be at full strength
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks pretty good,'' Toledo said. ``But he could go down
any second.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
So many mistakes, so little room for error. That was pretty much
the story of the Astros' 3-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on
Wednesday at Three Rivers Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   First of all, there is the matter of assigning blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the umpires made the right calls, we just got beat by a
good pitcher,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``If they
didn't, we got beat by the umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   The men in blue made a couple of calls with which the Astros
weren't particularly happy. Perhaps the most crucial came in the
sixth inning when Jose Lima walked Abraham Nunez on an apparent
three-ball count. At least that's how the Astros saw it.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion centered on a 2-0 pitch that Lima and just about
everyone on the Astros' bench thought was called a strike by
home-plate umpire Alfonso Marquez. Marquez denied signaling a
strike, making the count 3-0 instead of 2-1, as Lima thought.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez eventually walked and scored what proved to be the winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make a comment on that, because if I do, they'll stick
it to me,'' Lima said of the umpires. ``But I know in my heart that
it was a 2-0 count and that I threw a strike. It's on our
(pitching) charts. It's better for me to keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpire is the boss behind the plate,'' Lima (20-9)
continued. ``I'm not a crybaby; I don't make excuses. When you see
me arguing, you'd better believe it's because I'm competitive, not
because I'm a crybaby. The umpires have the power out there, and if
I argue I'll get a bad reputation and I may never get another call.
I don't have anything else to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty left to say about why the Astros lost for
the fifth time in seven games following their club-record 12-game
winning streak. The biggest reason was Pirates righthander Todd
Ritchie, who pitched a six-hitter and struck out 10 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie (14-9) even got praise from Astros center fielder Carl
Everett, which is the baseball equivalent of a presidential
endorsement. Everett seldom tips his cap to opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid pitched a great game,'' Everett said. ``That's the
third time he's beaten us, so you have to give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, who started the season in the minor leagues, has won
three of his four starts against the Astros, and the Pirates won
the season series 7-5. The Astros are off today before opening a
three-game series in Milwaukee over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pirates have had our number,'' Astros second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``At least we didn't lose all three of these games. We
just need to get out of here, enjoy the day off and come back with
a fresh outlook Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take more than a day off to change the Astros' outlook
about the quality of the umpiring in Wednesday's game. Dierker also
was peeved by a call at second base in the seventh inning when Lima
bunted into a double play, forcing Ricky Gutierrez at second in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on our bench thought he was safe,'' Dierker said.
``This was a tough one to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires were not to blame for all of the Astros' wounds;
some were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Lima twice failed in bunt situations. And with the score tied at
2 in the sixth inning, Everett made the final out between home
plate and third base when he tried to score from second on a ground
ball to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was clearly a baserunning mistake,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out, Daryle Ward hit a grounder to
Pirates first baseman Kevin Young, who one-hopped his throw to the
plate to force Stan Javier. While Pirates catcher Joe Oliver was
trying to sell his catch to the umpires, Everett was racing toward
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver realized what was happening quickly enough to foil
Everett's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see where he (Young) was throwing the ball,'' Everett
said. ``If there's a double-play ball and I'm on second base, I
always continue to go home. It was a miscommunication between me
and the third-base coach (Mike Cubbage).''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the all the subplots was a swifty pitching duel between
Lima and Ritchie. The 2-hour, 3-minute game was the Astros'
shortest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how the clock reads, losses always make for a long
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss is a loss,'' said Lima, who tied a career high with 10
strikeouts in seven innings. ``Even though the score was only 3-2,
I failed once again. We've got Cincinnati on our tails, and we
can't afford to be making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates took a 2-0 lead on Warren Morris' RBI double in the
second and Brant Brown's third-inning sacrifice fly. Young singled
home Nunez after the controversial sixth-inning walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored both of their runs in the fourth inning, one
on Jeff Bagwell's RBI single up the middle and the other on Ken
Caminiti's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lima failed in his second attempt to tie Joe Niekro's
single-season franchise record of 21 victories.

MIDDLE EASTERN CADETS RESIGN FROM MARITIME COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 20 Muslim cadets from the Middle East
resigned from the State University of New York's Maritime College
in the Bronx on Tuesday, saying they had been subjected to
demeaning treatment and, in two cases, physical attack by other
cadets.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman cadets, who are from Persian Gulf states like
Kuwait and Qatar, are all employees of a Kuwait-based shipping
company that is paying for them to study engineering or marine
transportation at the school. They contended that in the last
month, as they began to interact with upperclassmen, they had been
subjected to insensitive remarks about their religion and their
poor command of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat Arabic people like animals,'' Mohamed Al-Marri, 22,
who is from Qatar, said of the indoctrination duty officers, who
are in charge of the cadets. ``They had problems with Arabic
people. They don't like our religion.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they were taking the complaints seriously
and were investigating. But they said they did not believe the
cadets were the targets of ethnic or religious bias, but were
chafing at the school's military rigors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshman year is like a plebe year _ it's pretty
arduous,'' said Rear Adm. David C. Brown, the president of the
Maritime College. ``There are a lot of rules. Everyone is above
you. Everybody has to participate in the same level of
regimentation and restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he also thought that several of the students were
using the charges of persecution as an excuse to absolve them of
their financial obligation to United Arab Shipping Co., which began
sponsoring the students about a year ago. If the sponsored cadets
drop out of the school, they must repay their employer for all of
their tuition and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The school said the allegations involved 22 students, although
the students put the number variously at 21 and 23.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were levied as the school is attempting to resolve
financial problems of its own. Brown said Maritime desperately
needed to double its enrollment of 680 to remain a financially
viable part of the state university system. The enrollment of
foreign students is an important source of income for the school.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Middle Eastern cadets remained in their rooms,
rather than lining up in formation or attending classes, and said
they would do so until they received instructions from United Arab
Shipping.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Abdullah Al-Shammari, a 24-year-old resident of
Kuwait, said he was the victim of an assault early Monday. He said
he answered a knock at his door at 3 a.m. and saw a man wearing a
black mask and black gloves. The man tried to hit him with a sharp
object, he said, and tried to push his way into his room.
Al-Shammari said he was scratched on his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kuwaiti student, Faisal Ahmad, 25, said he and his
roommate were attacked in similar fashion, by a group of five men,
the previous weekend and also sustained minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the accusations were being investigated by the
university police and the commandant of cadets. Any cadets found
guilty of the attacks, he added, would be dismissed from the school
and could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   But, Brown added, ``We don't believe it's based on ethnicity or
religion.'' Rather, he said, he had reason to believe the attacks
had been personally motivated, although he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added that the American cadets had never had a problem
with Middle Eastern students. The school has had a successful
relationship with the Saudi Navy, he said. In 1995, 30 Saudi
students came to the college and 24 graduated in August. ``For us
and our students to interact with Middle Eastern students and know
their cultural requirements is nothing new,'' he said.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   In October, world population will reach 6 billion, or just
slightly less than double the population in 1960. That population
increase has not been distributed evenly, of course. Humanity has
crowded the coasts and clustered along the seams between tectonic
plates. It has made itself uniquely susceptible to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Much was done in Taiwan to mitigate the effects of Tuesday's
earthquake, thanks to good and apparently well-enforced building
codes. But the simple proliferation of human beings dictated that
thousands would die. In the United States we have been lucky, so
far, that an economic toll from earthquakes is unmatched by a toll
in human lives.
</P>
<P>
   But such luck is not likely to continue forever. Even where the
best technology is enforced by the most able bureaucracies, it
seems inevitable that one day the mass of humans will outweigh the
protective infrastructure. In the developed world, we have been
absolved, to a striking degree, from the natural consequences of
our numbers. But as the world population continues to grow, to push
into crowded cities erected atop fault zones, to settle in flood
plains and low-lying coastal areas, we will be forced to witness
our own immensity in the immense casualties that follow upon
disaster. We will have to recognize that some regions impose a
harsh, inflexible limit to further population growth.

PATAKI'S BUDGET FAILS TO USE GOOD TIMES TO PREPARE FOR BAD, CRITICS
SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As they approved the new state budget last month,
Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders called it a model of
sound judgment, a plan that raised spending at a modest pace and
put last year's large surplus into a reserve fund rather than
spending it.
</P>
<P>
   But a range of fiscal analysts, from Wall Street to private
watchdog groups to the state comptroller, have come to a strikingly
different conclusion: that despite a continuing economic boom that
has left most states in their best financial shape in decades, New
York's new budget actually worsens the state's long-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   They point to several factors they say will make it harder to
keep the budget balanced in years to come:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spending is expected to rise faster than income this year,
because enormous tax cuts enacted in past years are keeping state
revenues nearly flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The budget increased the use of one-time revenue sources that
cannot be repeated in the future, reversing Pataki's record of
cutting back on them.
</P>
<P>
   _ New tax cuts were enacted this year that will lower state
revenues in the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ While other states are using surpluses to pay off debts, this
budget will increase New York's debt, already the highest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   These experts say the steps taken by the state were not
egregious, but that many were the sort of questionable maneuvers
that states usually make to get through hard times, not when they
are swimming in cash. The experts share a fear that time may be
running out to take advantage of the nation's long-running
expansion to get New York's finances in order.
</P>
<P>
   The most detailed and stinging criticism of the budget came
Wednesday, in a 58-page report by State Comptroller Carl McCall.
McCall projected that the state's $37.4 billion general fund will
face a $2.8 billion deficit next year, a $4.6 billion deficit the
following year, and considerably larger gaps after that.
</P>
<P>
   The deficits might not materialize if the economy continues to
grow at the blistering pace of the last three years _ something
economists do not expect _ but otherwise, they can be closed only
by cutting spending or raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most distressing about it is they had a unique
opportunity to do some things that would have a positive long-term
impact, and they did the reverse,'' said McCall, a Democrat, who
did not lay blame specifically on the governor or the Legislature.
``They made the long-term problems more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, said: ``I haven't seen his report, but the
budget is an excellent budget. It's soundly balanced and preserves
the entire $1.8 billion surplus.'' In addition to major spending
increases on education and the environment, he said, ``it continues
us as leading the nation in cutting taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCall is far from alone in his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers ``went into the process with a long-run problem
and came out with a somewhat bigger long-run problem,'' said Diana
Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit
group that closely studies the budget. ``This budget was just
focused on getting through this year and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Mauro, director of the left-leaning Fiscal Policy
Institute, a nonprofit group in Albany, said: ``This budget is
incredibly short-sighted. It tries to take care of the next couple
of years _ though even those will be difficult _ and after that we
go over the precipice.''

<P>
   As home to legions of stock traders and wealthy investors, New
York has benefited heavily from the bull market, in the form of
rising income tax payments. Yet Wall Street rating agencies give it
the second-lowest bond rating of any state, ahead of only
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   This year, over the objections of the Democrats who control the
Assembly, the governor succeeded in having the entire $1.8 billion
surplus that accumulated during the 1998-99 fiscal year set aside,
rather than spent, in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   But that money is already spoken for, because the state plans to
use it over the next two years to pay for property tax cuts that
have been put into law, but are taking effect in stages. That
reserve is projected to run out in two years, and while McCall does
not project the state's finances beyond two years, he and other
analysts said that it is safe to assume the predicted deficits
would balloon beyond that point.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, administration officials pointed to a brief
report issued last month by Standard &AMP; Poor's, one of Wall Street's
major bond rating firms, that said the state's finances were
generally better than they were three years ago, a point no one
would dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service, Standard &AMP; Poor's main competitor, is
preparing a more detailed report for publication next month that is
expected to take a dimmer view of the budget. Moody's declined any
comment for the record until then, but one official there noted
that both the governor's and comptroller's office are projecting
much larger deficits one year into the future than they were at
this time last year, adding, ``that kind of speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The new budget totals $73.3 billion, a 3.8 percent increase over
last year, but much of that is money _ like federal welfare and
Medicaid payments, and tuition paid by State University of New York
students _ that has no direct effect on state finances. When those
elements are stripped out, what is left is the $37.4 billion
general fund, the portion of the budget generated by state taxes
and fees, and the part that analysts focus on.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has claimed that general fund growth, at 2.4 percent, is
within the rate of inflation _ a contention many economists would
dispute _ yet it is still higher than the projected 2 percent
increase in revenue. But even that 2.4 percent figure was arrived
at through accounting moves that simply declared some revenue and
spending to be outside the general fund. When those gimmicks are
accounted for, McCall said, general fund spending is actually up
3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also criticized the use of one-time revenues, like
selling assets or taking surpluses from little-noticed accounts,
that, by his count, total more than $500 million.

FEDS TARGET WEB `PAGE-JACKER' WHICH LOCKS COMPUTERS INTO PORN
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS reason why judge in Virginia is handling case in 12th graf.) 
(ATTN: Va., Texas)  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of a company that produces a popular
Internet game site for teen-agers was horrified last May when,
trying to call up his site, he got instead a screenful of lurid sex
scenes. Worse yet, he could not escape. Every time he tried to move
on, he got more pornographic scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that his Web site was not the only one victimized.
Some computer users searching for the Harvard Law Review, or trying
to find sites about ``Oklahoma tornadoes'' or ``news about Kosovo''
or ``child car seats,'' had the same experience. They were held
captive by pornographic sites from which they could not figure out
how to escape without turning off their computers.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 25 million Web pages, more than 2 percent of the
World Wide Web, may have been affected by the Internet fraud, which
investigators said was devised by an elusive Portuguese hacker and
an Australian pornography company.
</P>
<P>
   American and Australian investigators described the fraud at a
news conference here Wednesday and said that they had raided the
offices of the pornography company on the east coast of Australia
and had obtained an American court order to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These operators hijacked Web sites, kidnapped consumers and
held them captive,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal
Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ``They exposed
surfers, including children, to the seamiest sort of material and
incapacitated their computers so they couldn't escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme involved the cloning of legitimate Web pages,
including such sites as Audi, Paine Webber and the Japanese
Friendship Gardens. When computer users tried to reach those sites
using the Alta Vista search engine, which indexes the Web, they
were, in the new cyberspace parlance of investigators,
``page-jacked'' to a tawdry site run by the Australian company,
known to its customers as Kewl Images, Taboosisters.com,
Taboohardcore.com, or Tabooanimals.com.
</P>
<P>
   When computer users tried to escape those sites by clicking
``back'' or ``home'' buttons, they were instead directed to other
pornography sites, or ``mouse-trapped,'' investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the Portuguese hacker, Carlos Pereira, who
cannot be found, and the Australian company pulled off the scheme
by copying not only Web pages but also their so-called metatags.
The tags, invisible to viewers, provide key words and code that are
used to index the site for search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants stood to make money from the scheme in three
ways, the investigators said. They sold advertising on the Web
sites, almost exclusively from pornography companies, based on the
amount of traffic, and also offered viewers the chance to see more
Web sites by paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian company also used the scheme to inflate the value
of domain names, or Web addresses, by increasing the viewership of
those addresses through the page-jacking and mouse-trapping. The
company then tried to auction those domain names on an Internet
site at hundreds of times their original cost.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference at the Federal Trade Commission
Wednesday, Australian investigators who spoke through an Internet
video link from Canberra said they still did not know how much
money was made from the scheme. The Australian officials said they
are considering civil or criminal charges and had raided eight
locations, confiscating a variety of computers, routers and servers
integral to the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a federal judge in Virginia ordered many of
the sites run by the company and the Portuguese hacker off the Web
and directed them to stop copying legitimate web pages. The
contract for registering Internet names provides that disputes be
handled in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   American officials declined to give all the details of the
episode, saying they feared copycats. Even though the suspects are
all foreign individuals and companies, the officials said the U.S.
government became involved in the case because many victims were
Americans and American companies. The officials acted under the
Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive
practices affecting commerce. The content of the pornographic sites
was not a legal issue.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the scheme was a relatively new kind of
operation that did not involve traditional hacking, or the
defacement of a Web page. Rather, it involved the improper
diversion of consumers away from Web pages they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began after Angel Munoz, the president of
NewWorld.com, a popular Internet game site for teen-agers, was
preparing for a meeting of his board last May to consider a sale of
some of his company for more than $20 million. When Munoz tried to
see how accessible one of the company's sites was by using the Alta
Vista search engine, he was taken to a hard-core pornography site.
When he tried to get out of the page by clicking the back and home
buttons on his browser, more pornography sites appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Munoz recalled in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Munoz's company lawyers complained to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation in Dallas, which said it could do nothing about
the case. But after the MSNBC cable channel reported the incident,
the trade commission decided to start its own investigation. (Munoz
said the sale was never completed but for reasons unrelated to the
fraud.)
</P>
<P>
   Trade commission officials said the Australian company took the
pornographic sites down in June, but later in the summer put them
back up. Investigators said that when they were up, Alta Vista
received about 20 to 30 complaints each week. The complaints came
from diverse quarters. They included students on the Harvard Law
Review, mothers who had children on their laps when they were
page-jacked, and one man who said he had nearly lost his job when
his boss noticed he had lurid images on his computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Alta Vista said in an interview Wednesday that
pornography companies had repeatedly tried to trick computer users,
and that the company had taken steps to correct the problem by
carefully monitoring their index and by offering filters that can
be used to screen out objectionable sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support wholeheartedly what the FTC is doing in this
area,'' said David Emanuel, a spokesman for Alta Vista.
</P>
<P>
   But Munoz said Wednesday that when he contacted Alta Vista,
``They were not particularly helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Pereira is well known in the small community
of hackers and operated a site called Piratelynx.com. One official
said Wednesday that Pereira had boasted of his ability to ``control
Alta Vista.''
</P>
<P>
   But executives at Alta Vista said Wednesday that they had never
heard of him. His whereabouts are unknown, although the federal
judge in Virginia, recognizing that he was all but certain to
maintain a presence on the Internet, issued an unusual order that
permitted the government to serve him a summons by e-mail.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance Theater of Harlem's 30th birthday is happy
cause for celebration, and the company's gala opening of a two-week
anniversary season at City Center on Tuesday night naturally had a
festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic black-tie audience, which included Nane Annan,
wife of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, cheered Arthur Mitchell,
the troupe's artistic director and founder, and the first of the
season's new works.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garland, Dance Theater of Harlem's resident
choreographer, presented his latest premiere, ```Return,''' a witty
fusion of ballet technique and street gait whose irony toward
rhythm-and-blues had the audience in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Very different in its musical inspiration was the New York
premiere of ``South African Suite,'' distinguished for its score by
the Soweto String Quartet, played live onstage by the group's four
string players and two percussionists. The piece, commissioned by
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, was
choreographed by a collective consisting of Mitchell, Augustus Van
Heerden and Laveen Naidu and was now seen in an expanded version
produced in March.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by the company's celebrated version of
Stravinsky's ``Firebird,'' choreographed in 1982 by John Taras and
set in the dazzling tropical clime that Geoffrey Holder brings to
life with his resplendent decor and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Taras, a longtime associate of George Balanchine whose
international reputation as a choreographer dates back to the
1940s, has a mastery of classical technique that the other
choreographers onstage did not. Neither ```Return''' nor ``South
African Suite'' is world shaking. Yet they display a search for
something new, a freshness that comes with self-discovery that is
fascinating in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's turn to pop singers like James Brown and Aretha
Franklin and the creation of ``South African Suite'' after the
company's visit to South Africa in 1992, is not surprising. Life
experience, witnessed or lived, is often the best source of
creativity.
 &UR;  &LR; In the Soweto String Quartet, Mitchell has found his soul mates:
artists who use classical training as a springboard. Reuben Khemese
(cello), Sandile Khemese (principal violin), Thami Khemese (second
violin) and Makhosini Mnguni (viola) play Western instruments. Like
Dave Grusin, whose ``Bossa Baroque'' is part of the suite, they wed
classical and Baroque forms with the rhythms and melodies of South
Africa's people.
</P>
<P>
   These are diverse, as emphasized by the choreography and the two
drummers, Samir Chatterjee and Donald Eaton. A stylized warriors'
dance for 10 men has little in common with a swift solo inspired by
Indian classical dance that Camille Parson performed with a darting
liveliness.
</P>
<P>
   Like some South African jazz, the music has a gentle melodic
sound, and in this respect the choreography has the right tone. It
is elegant and refined in its abstract images.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting by Kevin Connaughton and Brady Jarvis reveals a
two-tier set. The musicians perform on the top platform, and
Caroline Rocher, in silhouette, is on the bench below. She is the
``enduring spirit,'' as the program calls her: She rocks an
invisible baby in her arms, struts on toe and walks on all fours,
her limbs stretched. She is vibrant and has a voluptuous jete.
Pamela Allen-Cummings' costumes include black-and-white print
halters for both men and women. A highlight is the acrobatic and
neoclassical adagio for Kellye A. Saunders and James Washington,
full of stretches and zigzagging bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Long, Paunika Jones and Kevin Thomas dance a jazzy
wrist-rotating trio, and Duncan Cooper and Ramon Thielen lead the
symmetrical warriors' dance, invisible spears held overhead. Here
as elsewhere, one notices a new talent, the young Eric Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography, rituals full of spliced-in conventional double
turns in the air and pirouettes, could use more invention. But the
spirit is right, and one has to be numb not to feel its
authenticity in the three-tiered communal celebration at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Garland also uses a suite structure in ```Return.''' But the
effect suggests a series of sketches that fade out with each
recording. Ms. Long, remembered for her fine dancing in New York
City Ballet, is the wiggling pert siren in Ms. Allen-Cummings'
silvery costume who opens the work to Brown's recording of ``Mother
Popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Transitions between steps could be smoother, but Garland knows
how to marry street smarts with neoclassical style. Ms. Long leads
a strutting group of women on toe and men in jumpsuits. Ms.
Saunders and Donald Williams get the love duet amplified by other
couples as Ms. Franklin sings ``Baby, Baby, Baby.'' In the final
hilarious number, ``Call Me,'' she sings ``I Love You'' to her one
and only, but Lenore Pavlakos moves from man to man in a tilted
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Firebird,'' it was graced by Ms. Long's performance in
the title role. Small rather than dominating and excellently
partnered by Cooper, she triumphs through the details of her
dancing. Joseph E. Fields conducted.

   BRYAN, Texas _ Jurors deciding the fate of capital murderer
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., a white supremacist convicted in last
year's dragging death of a disabled black man, deliberated more
than 11 hours Wednesday before going to a hotel for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of 11 Anglos and one Hispanic will return to court at 9
a.m. CST Thursday to resume deliberations on whether Brewer, 32,
will be sentenced to life in prison or death by injection for
chaining James Byrd Jr., 49, to a pickup by his ankles and dragging
him to his death near Jasper on June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brewer became the second man convicted of capital
murder in Byrd's killing. A Jasper County jury earlier this year
sent John William ``Bill'' King, 24, to death row. A third
defendant, Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, will be tried next month in
Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   After a tense day of waiting at the Brazos County Courthouse,
where Brewer's trial was moved, Byrd's nephew, Darrell Verrett,
said, ``I didn't expect it to take this long. Nobody did. I think
they're just being careful about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of humor is seeing us through,'' said Byrd's sister,
Clara Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's brother, John, said, ``The waiting just causes more
agony for the family. The longer it goes, the worse it is. Either
way it goes, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's aunt, Shirley Brown, said as sheriff's deputies
escorted the Brewer and Byrd families to their cars, ``This is left
in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Brewer's parents and other relatives and friends
took the witness stand to plead for a life prison sentence, which
would require Brewer to serve at least 40 years before being
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 11 hours and 20 minutes of deliberation, the two
families sat in the hallway outside the courtroom or on the
courthouse grounds, occasionally mingling with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main word is frustration,'' said Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray as he left the courthouse, But he said he
was encouraged that the jurors wanted to work until 9:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have obviously turned this over a hundred different
ways,'' said Gray's assistant, Pat Hardy. ``Either way, justice
will be done. I'll certainly be disappointed if they don't go for
the death penalty, but I know they are working hard and they are
doing the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Brewer's defense attorneys, Doug Barlow, said, ``To try
to tell what a jury is doing by how long they are out is like
trying to read tea leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, the former ``Exalted Cyclops'' of a racist prison gang
affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan, has spent most of his adult life
in prison for burglary, cocaine possession and parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd's gruesome killing, which drew worldwide media
attention to East Texas and prompted armed black separatists and
the KKK to march on Jasper, was Brewer's first violent offense.
</P>
<P>
   That fact may be the source of the jurors' difficulties in
answering one of three questions they must answer: whether Brewer
would be a continuing threat of violence if they spare him from the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   After four hours, jurors sent out a note, asking for the legal
definition of the words ``society,'' ``violence'' and
``probability.'' State District Judge Monte Lawlis sent back a
message saying there is no legal definition and jurors should rely
on the words' common meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, jurors asked for a dictionary. It was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, jurors asked to see Brewer's letters and jailhouse
notes, a portion of his testimony and a psychologist's report.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Wednesday morning, another of Brewer's
attorneys, Layne Walker, quoted Bible verses and told jurors that
other than their own salvation, this would be the most important
decision of their lives. He said Brewer was caught in ``the classic
situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, Brewer blamed his co-defendants Berry and King
for the crime.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani threatened Wednesday to cut
off all city subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum of Art unless it
cancels next week's opening of a British art exhibition that
features, among other works, a shark suspended in a tank of
formaldehyde, a bust of a man made from his own frozen blood and a
portrait of the Virgin Mary stained with a clump of elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has seen the show's catalog but not the
exhibition itself, derided the works of art generally as ``sick
stuff.'' But he singled out the portrait of the Virgin Mary as
particularly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating
somebody else's religion,'' he said. ``And therefore we will do
everything that we can to remove funding for the Brooklyn Museum
until the director comes to his senses and realizes that if you are
a government-subsidized enterprise, then you can't do things that
desecrate the most personal and deeply held views of people in
society. I mean, this is an outrageous thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor follows through on his threat, it could severely
hamper the museum's operations. The city gives the museum nearly $7
million a year in operating expenses _ nearly one-third of its $23
million budget _ and has reserved another $20 million in the budget
for capital improvements. The museum is the second largest in New
York, after the Metropolitan, and has a permanent collection of
more than 1.5 million objects.
</P>
<P>
   But if Arnold L. Lehman, the museum's director, was intimidated
by Giuliani's expression of outrage, he did not let on Wednesday.
He said he hoped to meet with the mayor ``to encourage him not to
take such an action,'' and added ``it is part of a museum's job to
support the right of artists to express themselves freely.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's angry reaction _ ``I'm offended,'' he said _ is
typical of the visceral response that the show, called ``Sensation:
Young British Artists From That Saatchi Collection,'' has generated
both in the United States and in Europe, where it opened to raves
and criticism at the Royal Academy of Arts in London two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the work of young British artists whose works are
displayed in museums around the world, the show is intended to
disturb, perturb and provoke thought. It was mounted at a cost of
$1 million and is the largest ever held by the Brooklyn Museum. The
show is financed in part by the Christie's, the auction house.

   Some critics and viewers in London argued that the content of
the show was offensive and intended to shock for shock's sake. A
few wryly suggested that it was designed primarily to increase the
value of the works amassed by Charles Saatchi, the London
advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   The most extreme reaction was to the artist Marcus Harvey's
depictions of Myra Hindley, who was convicted in the macabre
``moors murders'' of children in western England in the 1960s.
Protesters splattered ink and raw eggs on the painting, saying it
trivialized her victims' suffering and glorified her crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, felt that the exhibition captured an important
moment in the history of contemporary British art. Many dealers say
that they have waiting lists of collectors eager to buy the works
of those they believe to be the groundbreaking artists.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition attracted record crowds in London and at the
Hamburger Bahnof in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum sought to create the same kind of excitement
for the show's only North American engagement, which opens Oct. 2.
It announced that children under the age of 17 will have to be
accompanied by an adult. Even its promotions read like health
warnings on a cigarette pack: ``The contents of this exhibition may
cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety. If
you suffer from high blood pressure, a nervous disorder or
palpitations, you should consult your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the show's catalog that sparked the charged emotions
that publicity-hungry museums crave.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Damien Hirst is perhaps the exhibition's best known artist; his
work depicting a pair of cows sliced and suspended in a tank of
formaldehyde caused a stir at a Soho gallery three years ago. And
his shark-in-a-tank piece immediately attracted the ire of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Newkirk, the organization's president, dismissed Hirst as
a ``shock jock'' who ``is contributing to the slaughter of animals
for no other reason than his own aggrandizement.'' (Hirst denies
that he kills animals, saying they are already dead.)

</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights, said that the catalog turned his stomach. ``I
think the whole city should picket the show,'' he said. ``This
exhibition is designed to shock, but instead it induces
revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the reaction of Giuliani that signaled both a
publicity coup for the museum and a threat to its own finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to do that privately and pay for that
privately, well that's what the First Amendment is all about,'' he
said. ``I mean, you can be offended by it and upset by it, and you
don't have to go see it, if somebody else is paying for it. But to
have the government subsidize something like that is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He went on to add a quick critique of Hirst's work. ``I though
that's what they did in biology laboratories,'' he said, ``not in
museums of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine later explained the mechanics of the
mayor's threat to cut off city funds. ``They get their checks on a
first-of-the-month basis,'' Levine said. ``Those checks will be
suspended unless this exhibit is canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would happen if the museum did not cancel the
show, Levine said: ``Then they're not going to get any more city
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a New York attorney who specializes in First
Amendment law, suggested that the mayor understands the amendment
that protects free expression ``precisely backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishing the Brooklyn Museum by seeking to remove its funding
because the mayor disapproves of what he perceives is the message
of its art is at war with the First Amendment,'' Abrams said. ``The
mayor has every right to denounce the exhibition. He should
understand, however, that the First Amendment limits what he can do
to retaliate against art of which he disapproves.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's threat may set up another confrontation with the
City Council. Speaker Peter F. Vallone also said he was offended by
the artworks, and urged New Yorkers not to see the show, but said
he would oppose the mayor's withholding of the museum subsidy. The
council has final authority over the budget.

<P>
   The struggle between artists trying to express themselves and
the government trying to define what it considers acceptably
artistic has intensified in recent years with disputes over several
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington backed down and
canceled an exhibition featuring the homoerotic art of Robert
Mapplethorpe and financed by the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the Supreme Court upheld a congressional decency
test for awarding federal arts grants, but only after a majority
interpreted a 1990 law as containing only ``advisory language''
that did not actually prohibit federal subsidies for indecent art.
In a majority opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court
suggested that if the law was invoked to impose ``a penalty on
disfavored viewpoints,'' it would violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case brought against the NEA by the
performance artist Karen Finley and three other artists. Two NEA
grants in 1989, for a retrospective of sexually explicit
photographs by Mapplethorpe and to the artist Andres Serrano, who
photographed a crucifix immersed in his own urine, had ignited a
furor that has never completely died down.
</P>
<P>
   Some museum directors were taken aback by Giuliani's threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled,'' Mimi Gaudieri, the director of the Association
of Art Museum Directors. ``We've been through this war before _ not
only with Mapplethorpe but with Serrano and others _ and we've won.
It just doesn't play in the political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ofili, a Roman Catholic whose portrait of the Virgin Mary
so offended the mayor and whose work often features clumps of
elephant dung, defended his work as being of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an altar boy I was confused by the idea of a holy Virgin
Mary giving birth to a young boy,'' he said. ``Now when I go to the
National Gallery and see paintings of the Virgin Mary, I see how
sexually charged they are. Mine is simply a hip-hop version.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department closed the book Wednesday on
its criminal investigation of the tobacco industry and instead
filed a far-reaching civil lawsuit that accuses the largest
cigarette companies of conspiring since the 1950s to defraud and
mislead the public about the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover billions of dollars the federal
government spent on smoking-related health care for elderly
Medicare patients, military veterans and federal employees,
expenses not covered by the $246 billion in settlements that the
industry reached last year with the states over smoking-related
Medicaid costs for the poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who first announced that the Justice
Department would pursue such a lawsuit in his State of the Union
Message last January, told reporters at the White House on
Wednesday that ``the tobacco companies should answer to the
taxpayers for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Relying heavily on documents unearthed in the state claims, the
lawsuit accuses the tobacco industry of promoting biased research,
wrongly asserting that nicotine was not addictive and falsely
denying that they were targeting their products to children.
</P>
<P>
   Along with monetary damages, which the suit says exceed $20
billion a year, the suit seeks to tap into what the suit calls the
tobacco industry's ``ill-gotten gains'' and force the industry to
finance education programs about the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 45 years, the companies that manufacture and sell
tobacco have waged an intentional, coordinated campaign of fraud
and deceit,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news
conference. ``As we allege in the complaint, it has been a campaign
designed to preserve their enormous profits whatever the cost in
human lives, human suffering and medical resources. The
consequences have been staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include Philip Morris Cos., The Liggett Group,
American Tobacco Co., British-American Tobacco PLC,
British-American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co.
Along with these companies, which sell more than 98 percent of the
cigarettes in the United States, the suit also names two industry
groups, the Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. and the Tobacco
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Condemning the suit as politically motivated, tobacco executives
vowed to seek its immediate dismissal. ``We will not succumb to
politically correct extortion,'' said Greg Little, associate
general counsel for Philip Morris. ``We will not settle this
lawsuit. We're right on the law. We're right on the facts. We will
prevail in this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism also came from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which
accused the Clinton administration of pursuing the lawsuit because
Congress last year failed to act on tobacco legislation that would
have tightened the regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business can feel secure in the United States when the
enormous power of the Justice Department can be unleashed against
them for the purpose of raising revenue and scoring political
points,'' Bruce Josten, the chamber's executive vice president,
said in a statement. ``This is nothing more than taxation through
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about statements from the companies calling the suit
politically motivated, Clinton said, ``We did our best to work with
them and with the Congress to resolve many of these matters
legislatively, and they declined.''
</P>
<P>
   This development has elements that are both good and bad for the
tobacco industry. It escapes a criminal investigation that has been
lingering for years but instead faces a potentially costly civil
lawsuit. The federal government, if it enters into settlement talks
with the industry would likely try to get the industry to agree to
increased regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But industry foes praised the Justice Department for keeping the
makers and marketers of cigarettes on their heels. ``When the
Justice Department wins, it will be a great victory by the American
taxpayers,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who has fought for
tighter regulation of the tobacco industry. ``The tobacco companies
have perpetrated a fraud on the American people for decades. When
it comes to a matter of law, all their campaign contributions won't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit heats up an issue that was already bubbling on the
campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans, who
receive the bulk of the industry's political donations, have
accused the White House of going too far to regulate what is a
legal product. The House and Senate have resisted an administration
effort to add $20 million to the appropriations bill that funds the
Justice Department to pay for the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is generally
considered the leading Republican presidential contender, said that
Bush ``hoped the era of big government will not be replaced by the
era of big lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government case is built upon much of the same
evidence as the state cases, the Justice Department is relying on
different statutes _ the Medical Care Recovery Act and the Medicare
Secondary Payer Act, both of which the government typically uses to
recover medical costs in individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   By amassing the cases of tens of thousands of smokers into one
suit, the government is seeking to sidestep the industry's
preference for trying smoking cases smoker by smoker. The industry
argues that smokers have long been warned of the health effects of
smoking, but the government's lawsuit says the industry engaged in
a vigorous campaign to create doubt among smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with fierce political resistance, the federal government
decided not to pursue a plan to seek some of the money the states
received in settlements over Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials refused to elaborate on the end of
the criminal investigation, which began about five years ago and
looked into whether tobacco executives lied to Congress and
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The civil case cannot use evidence obtained during the Justice
Department's criminal investigation without a court order. But the
civil case can rely on documents that came to light during the
state suits and other suits filed by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, the suit cites a 1998 press release issued by a
trade group, the Tobacco Institute, saying claims that cigarette
smoking is addictive ``defy common sense and contradict the fact
that people quit smoking every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit is the first the government has filed
against an entire industry using the RICO statute. The law was
drafted in the late 1960s to fight organized crime but has been
broadly applied by federal prosecutors against businesses and
others engaged in a pattern of illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   A few states, including Florida and Texas, have used RICO counts
in their lawsuits against the cigarette makers.

<P>
   ``I can't remember an entire industry that was targeted as if it
was a racketeering enterprise'' by the federal government, said
Joseph DiGenova, a former federal prosecutor in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Justice Department's decision to formally end its
long-running criminal investigation, DiGenova said that he believed
the decision was practical and well founded. While the burden of
proof in a criminal case is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the
burden in the type of civil action filed on Wednesday is only a
preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose the easier route for them and very wisely because
criminal cases, by their very nature, are iffy,'' said DiGenova.
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed in the U.S. District Court in the District of
Columbia, has been assigned to Judge Gladys Kessler, who was
appointed to the federal bench by Clinton in 1994 and is known for
pushing to resolve disputes out of court.

 &HT;    Too much death for N.C. towns
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ Not all the dead are resting after Hurricane
Floyd killed more than 40 people in North Carolina and unearthed
coffins along swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Wilson, sobbing relatives Wednesday buried three
of the storm's victims, killed when a boat capsized last week near
Pinetops. But widespread flooding has delayed other burials across
eastern North Carolina, devastated by the state's worst natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Coffins and vaults bobbing in floodwaters have become an
unsettling sight, and some survivors don't want to bury their loved
ones in muddy graves. In nearby towns such as Rocky Mount, high
water separates bodies stored in hospital morgues from out-of-town
kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrible,'' said Brenda Wright, nursing supervisor at
Nash General Hospital in Rocky Mount. Its morgue has room for
eight, prompting officials to bring in a refrigerated
tractor-trailer for Floyd's victims.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, three of the hospital's 10 storm dead had been
delivered to funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven were in the trailer, partly to prevent the
odor of decomposing flesh from fouling the morgue, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three graves in Pinetops have been ripped apart by
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state officials said floating corpses in caskets pose far
less of a health risk than widespread municipal and farm sewage
spills.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the spread of disease, officials are scrambling to
dispose of more than 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000
turkeys that drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no health risk involved with an embalmed body,'' said
Jeff Winstead, an official with the state's emergency response team
in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The state medical examiner's office has a procedure for
identifying and reinterring corpses, Winstead said. But considering
the sewage and livestock threats, he said, ``That is not one of the
emergency issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As waters recede, Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical
examiner, said, he expects the official death toll of 41 to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we expecting the number to increase? Yes,'' Wright said.
``It may be three or four more. It may be 10 more. I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ayden, embalmer Don Brown prepared two bodies over the
weekend, but flooding prevented him from releasing them to funeral
homes in Williamston and Elizabeth City.
</P>
<P>
   Rest Haven Cemetery in Wilson had dried out enough for
Wednesday's burial of Ben and Vivian Mayo and their 23-year-old
daughter, Keisha Vines.
</P>
<P>
   Vines' 5-year-old daughter, Tekisha, also apparently died, but
her body was not found until Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate,'' Josephine Edwards, director of Edwards
Funeral Home, said as she greeted some of the several hundred
people who attended the two-hour service at the L.N. Forbes
Original Free Will Baptist Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   The three Mayo family members from Pinetops were among six
people who drowned a week ago in flooding from Town Creek in
Edgecombe County.
</P>
<P>
   Remembered during the funeral service as a hero who tried to
save his neighbors, Ben Mayo, 50, was steering a rescue boat that
overturned, killing half of the 12 people aboard in Hurricane
Floyd's deadliest accident.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile away, a 6- to 8-foot swell rushed across low
ground along Town Creek and unearthed two vaults in an old cemetery
on Bynum Farm Road.
</P>
<P>
   A third hole is empty, but Pinetops Mayor Earl Coker said he's
not sure whether it had contained a casket.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a week since flooding uncovered the stone vaults.
</P>
<P>
   One was turned on its side, with one end pointing to the sky.
Another poked from the ground, its lid ajar. Some of the people who
look after the cemetery have been flooded out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that happened beyond our control,'' said B.C.
Pitt, who is staying at the emergency shelter in Carver Elementary
School in Pinetops.
</P>
<P>
   If residents are not able to restore the graves, volunteer fire
and rescue Chief Steve Bynum said, ``the county will make sure they
are taken care of.''
