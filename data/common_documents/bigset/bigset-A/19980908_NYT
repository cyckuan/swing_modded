LASORDA: SOSA IS MVP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ On the day the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire tied
Roger Maris' all-time single-season record with 61 home runs,
Dodgers GM Tom Lasorda cast his unofficial MVP vote for the Chicago
Cubs' Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be Sosa,'' Lasorda said. ``Look what Sosa has
meant to his team this season. The reward is for the most (ital)
valuable (off) player. It is the guys who is most valuable to his
team. That's what it is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   MVP voting, which is done by writers covering major league
baseball and based only on regular season contribution, is largely
subjective. But it usually is given to the player who has most
helped his team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Cardinals' Lou Brock was named National League
Player of the Year by The Sporting News after stealing a then major
league record 118 bases. But the Dodgers Steve Garvey was named MVP
after taking the club to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colorado's Larry Walker was named NL MVP after
winning batting and RBI titles. Mike Piazza batted .362 with 40
homers, 124 RBI and a .360 average with runners in scoring
position. He also kept the Dodgers in the NL West race until the
final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has 58 homers, has been critical to the Cubs' climb
from a last-place team (68-94) a year ago, to a 80-64 record and a
tie with the New York Mets for the NL wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who hit No. 61 in the first inning of Monday's 3-2
victory over the Cubs, has electrified the country with his pursuit
of Maris' record. But the Cardinals, pre-season favorites to win
the NL Central, have gone 70-73, 20 1/2 games behind
division-leading Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take Sosa off that team,'' Lasorda said, ``where would
they be.''
</P>
<P>
   Park to Japan:Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park has agreed to
participate in the annual eight-game All-Star series in Japan
beginning Nov. 1 against a collection of all-stars from the
Japanese leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who spends much of the winter in his native Korea, flies
to Orlando, Fla. on Oct. 27 for a two-day workout. He then heads to
Japan for the opening game against the world famous Yomiuri Giants.
Park will earn $83,000.
</P>
<P>
   Park also is being recruited by Korea to play for the national
team in the Asian Games, which begin Dec. 15 in Bankok, Thailand.
The Dodgers have yet to grant him permission to play.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits:Raul Mondesi missed his third consecutive game with
lower back soreness, but he did accompany the team to Arizona and
hopes to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns, Mondesi will be back in right field, where he
played until the May 15 acquistion of Gary Sheffield. With
Sheffield gone for the season (sprained left ankle), manager Glenn
Hoffman decided to move Mondesi to take added strain off the back.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi also has said recently he thinks the responsibilities of
playing center have hurt his offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot to think about out there,'' Hoffman said. ``He
is still our centerfielder, no question. But I think the transition
during the season has been a drain on him. When he gets to spring
training he'll have a better idea of the responsibilities of the
position.''

`MARY' SPURTS UP TO TOP OF BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Surprise hit ``There's Something About Mary''
edged ``Blade'' to post its first victory at the nation's box
office with an estimated $10.9 million at 2,555 theaters during the
Friday-Monday Labor Day weekend, studio sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' in a reflection of the strong word-of-mouth it
received after opening in mid-July, became the only film ever to
lead the weekend box office for the first time after eight weeks in
nationwide release. The goofy romantic comedy has grossed $130.2
million overall, and its weekend-to-weekend improvement was an
impressive 31 percent, far better than any rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance by `Something About Mary' has been just
incredible,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' carries an estimated $24 million price tag, by far the
lowest budget among successful summer movies, and could top $175
million for 20th Century Fox by the end of its domestic run,
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mary' should do very well for a while since there's really
nothing out there against it,'' he said. ``Fall is the king of
dramas and thrillers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also performing impressively on the final weekend of Hollywood's
summer season was two-time box office leader ``Blade'' with $10.7
million at 2,375 theaters to move its 18-day total to $49.5 million
for New Line. Bucksbaum said the studio showed savvy in scheduling
``Blade,'' starring Wesley Snipes as a part-vampire crime-fighter,
late in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Line was really smart to wait until all the other summer
popcorn movies were played out,'' he said. ``It's one of the few
films right now for teen-agers and young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG's seventh weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan''
continued its solid performance with $8.6 million at 2,807
locations to move its overall gross to $166.6 million. Bucksbaum
said the studio is certain to make a major push for ``Ryan'' during
the Academy Awards campaign season this winter, ensuring the D-Day
epic will finish well above $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the 45th-highest domestic grosser of
all time behind ``Three Men and a Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening of ``Knock Off,'' starring Jean-Claude Van Damme
battling terrorists in Hong Kong, performed adequately in fourth,
with $5.7 million at 1,800 theaters. The studio acquired rights to
the action-adventure at relatively low cost and expects to generate
a profit on the project, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sixth weekend of ``Ever After'' finished a solid fifth
with $4.3 million at 2,001 sites to push its overall take past $54
million. The ``Cinderella'' remake easily beat a pair of
disappointments in their second weekends _ Miramax's ``54'' with
$3.5 million and Warner Bros.' ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' with
$3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Paramount's fifth weekend of
``Snake Eyes'' with $3.3 million at 1,912 sites, Fox's fourth
weekend of ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' with $3 million at
1,339 locations and Disney's sixth weekend of ``The Parent Trap''
with $2.8 million at 2,045 theaters. Disney's 10th weekend of
``Armageddon,'' with $2.7 million, may have also cracked the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' has reached $192 million and ranks 26th on the
all-time domestic list after ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's limited opening of ``Firelight,'' a costume drama with
Sophie Marceau as a governess seeking her out-of-wedlock child,
debuted impressively with $125,000 at 10 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is nearing $4.7 billion and is 13 percent
ahead of the same period last year. Summer business, from Memorial
Day weekend to Labor Day, topped $2.5 billion, or 12 percent up
from last summer with nine films taking in more than $100 million,
including ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``There's Something About Mary,''
``Lethal Weapon 4,'' ``The Truman Show'' and ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Titanic,'' despite having been in video stores
since last Tuesday, drew $190,000 at 447 theaters in its 38th
weekend to push its overall domestic total to $600.7 million, or
$140 million more than its closest rival. About 80 percent of
``Titanic's'' total total came during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary,'' ``Blade'' and ``Saving Private
Ryan'' face competition next weekend from Miramax's opening of
``Rounders,'' starring Matt Damon as a card shark, and Disney's
family drama ``Simon Burch.''

PARENTHOOD STUDY PAINTS BLEAK PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 2nd graf refers to Tuesday.) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Compared to childless Californians, those with
children are poorer, less educated and less likely to have adequate
medical care, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, 21 percent of Californians with children are single
parents, according to the set for release today by the Institute
for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all California adults with children have no more than a
high school degree and only 22 percent have a college degree,
according to the study. Among adults without children, 35 percent
have a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 28 percent of Californians with
children under 18 are living below or near the federal poverty
level, compared to 11 percent of those without children. The
federal poverty level is $13,342 in household income for a family
of three and $22,000 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of every five households with children is
``very or somewhat likely to experience housing, food or medical
attention in the next two months,'' the study found. Only one in 10
childless households was in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   The study is based on a telephone survey of 1,771 California
adults. Researchers conducted the survey from June 10 to July 21.
</P>
<P>
   The study also concluded that ``working parents face great
demands in balancing employment and family needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study noted that ``22 percent of California's parents report
not getting enough sleep on at least 20 days in the past month, a
larger proportion than among adults with no children in the
household (14 percent).''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the study also found that single parents are
in much worse financial shape than couples with children. Half of
California's single parents have incomes of less than $20,000,
compared to 21 percent of couples with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When single parents do work, they would appear to have lower
levels of job security than their counterparts in couples,'' the
study noted. ``In the past three years, 22 percent of the former
vs. 16 percent of the latter report losing a job or leaving one
because they expected to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress and financial strain of being a parent also appears
to take a toll on one's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small proportion of single parents reports being in
excellent or very good health than parents in couples (53 vs. 63
percent),'' the study found. ``In addition, twice as many single
parents as their counterparts in couples experience a high or
moderate level of depressive symptoms (33 percent vs. 17
percent).''
</P>
<P>
   Single parents are also more likely to smoke and drink heavily,
the study concluded. Twenty-one percent of single parents have more
than three drinks a day, compared to only 11 percent of parents in
couples.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Cincinnati Reds came closer to scoring off Randy Johnson than
any of the teams Johnson had shut out in his three previous starts
in the Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the scoreboard still reads all zeros.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched a six-hitter for his fourth straight shutout at
home as the Astros labored to a 1-0 victory over the Reds before a
crowd of 42,787 on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Astros' fourth straight win at home and their 13th in
the last 16 games at the Dome as they pulled within one game of
Atlanta for the best record in the National League. Since Johnson
was acquired, the Astros are 26-9.
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros' offense showed the effects of a long, late
haul back from Arizona following a 10-run outburst Sunday night,
Johnson was fresh and ready. He struck out 14 while extending his
scoreless-innings streak at home to 36.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a struggle. Johnson (7-1) escaped his own mistake in
the eighth inning when Brook Fordyce led off with a double and
pinch runner Pat Watkins took third when Johnson threw wildly to
first base on an appeal play.
</P>
<P>
   The stage set, Johnson took care of the next three batters _
pinch hitter Melvin Nieves, Reggie Sanders and Chris Stynes _ on
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's a close ballgame, you realize that you don't have a
lot of leeway to be giving up base hits and making big innings
happen, because that one run had to hold up,'' Johnson said. ``To
go that far and hold a quality team down like that, and then just
about throw the ballgame away _ or at least let them back in it _
it was big to get out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell provided the offense with his 19th home run, a
sixth-inning shot off Reds righthander Steve Parris (4-4).
</P>
<P>
   In four starts at the Astrodome since being acquired from
Seattle on July 31, Johnson is 4-0 with 51 strikeouts and four
walks. He has 85 strikeouts in eight starts overall. He is
responsible for the Astros' top four strikeout totals this season.
</P>
<P>
   His NL ERA is 1.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like his fastball went up 2 to 3 miles per hour and
his slider got sharper (in the eighth),'' first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``That's what the great pitchers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people who have been around and seen Nolan (Ryan) and Mike
(Scott know), it doesn't matter if there is a guy at third base
with no outs. He can strike out three straight guys. That's as
impressive an eighth inning as I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to score a few more runs and make Randy's
job a little easier. We didn't swing the bats well all day. We
didn't mount much. He made a one-run lead hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier Astrodome starts, Johnson had a pair of five-hitters
against Philadelphia and Milwaukee and a seven-hitter against
Pittsburgh. After eight NL starts, Johnson's four shutouts rank
second only to Atlanta's Greg Maddux, who has five _ in 30 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to face the Big Unit. You've got to throw extremely
well when you face him,'' Parris said. ``If you give up one run or
more, there's a good chance you're going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Barry Larkin single in the first inning, Johnson retired
nine straight batters. Since Larkin was caught stealing, the Reds
sent the minimum 12 hitters to the plate through four innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Dmitri Young singled to lead off. Following
strikeouts to Jeffrey Hammonds and Bret Boone, the Reds loaded the
bases when Aaron Boone doubled and Fordyce was intentionally
walked. Parris struck out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros couldn't manage much against Parris, who
allowed four hits in seven innings and struck out seven. Parris,
who entered with a three-game winning streak, had a two-hitter
until Bell homered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of the Astros, you think of Moises Alou, Jeff
Bagwell and Craig Biggio,'' Bell said. ``I just sneak in from
behind, like always.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, some people look at the scoreboard and see my numbers
and say, `Wow, this guy is swinging the bat pretty good.' I like to
sneak up because nobody pays attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were too busy paying attention to Johnson, who threw
the first 1-0 shutout against the Reds since Maddux did it Aug. 15,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally figure if you hold a team to one run we're going
to win, but not with Randy Johnson on the mound,'' Reds manager
Jack McKeon said. ``He's at the top of his game.''

THE CHASE ENERGIZES CARDINALS

 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Just like Mark McGwire, his St. Louis Cardinals
teammates have been living with the Great Home Run Chase since
spring training. They've been thrilled by the spectacle but are
relieved it's almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to break this thing so he can settle down,'' catcher
Tom Lampkin said. ``It's so exciting, everybody wants him to get it
so bad. But we want to get it over with so we can get on with
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin watched the historic home run from the Cardinals' bench
and said he had thoughts of running the bases with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is the same burst of energy for No. 62 as there was
for 61, I might jump over that (dugout) fence,'' Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Bobby Witt watched the home run from the bullpen and
didn't get to participate in the mob scene near the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits one (Tuesday), I'm coming out of the bullpen,
that's for sure,'' Witt said. ``Every one he's hit since breaking
the National League record, I get goosebumps up my arms. Today was
no exception.'' LUCKY FAN HAD FREE TICKETS
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis fan Mike Davidson's brother-in-law has two Cardinals
season tickets in the left-field bleachers. But Mike Izo gave them
to Davidson on Monday, and the 28-year-old catering manager got the
thrill of his life.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's record-tying home run caromed off the front of the
second deck Monday and fell into the bleachers where Davidson was
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bounced off five people's hands and rolled underneath my
seat,'' Davidson said. ``I picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, caught up in the generous spirit of the home run
chase, said he was giving the ball back to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked about it at work, joking around what we would
want for it and everything,'' Davidson said. ``But I always figured
I would give it back to McGwire.'' EX-ATHLETICS GET HUGS
</P>
<P>
   McGwire sought out manager Tony La Russa and trainer Barry
Weinberg for special hugs. Both have been with McGwire for many
years, dating to when they were all members of the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa managed McGwire in Oakland from 1987-95 before being
hired by the Cardinals. Weinberg was in Oakland until last season,
then was hired by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, Tony gave me my start,'' McGwire said. ``I
wasn't supposed to make the team back in 1987. He decided to stay
with me and I remember the night _ it was April 1 in Anaheim _ and
he stuck with me and the next thing you know I hit 49 home runs. He
stuck with me through the year of 1991 when I hit .201.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry and I have gone through so much through my back
injuries, through my foot injuries, the only time Barry and I have
been apart is just the two months when I was traded over here last
year. Those two guys have backed me, supported me, just been with
me since Day One in Oakland and here in St. Louis.'' McGWIRE MEETS
MARIS FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Maris, the widow of Roger Maris, was still recovering
from heart complications experienced Friday, and did not attend
Monday's game. But McGwire did meet with her four sons after the
game: Roger Jr. 39, Kevin, 38, Randy, 37, and Rich, 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all thanked me and gave me a hug and I'm sure if we were
more private, it would have been a little bit more emotional,''
McGwire said. ``I said I would love to meet with them some day when
this is all over and to talk to them and basically tell them what
their father was going through at that time because it is an
amazing story.'' HOME RUN GREETING
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has hit so many home runs he has become an expert at
post-blast greetings. In Oakland, he and Jose Canseco came up with
the forearm bash, which led to the Bash Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``handshake'' in St. Louis is double high-fists
followed by an exchange of playful punches in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started doing it,'' McGwire said. ``Everybody, you
know, is doing a fist or high-five. For some reason I just started
hitting our guys in the stomach and it's like they've got pretty
good stomachs. But we just started doing that and I don't know, it
just carried on and it's just something that people are watching
right now.''

WHAT PRESSURE? SOSA'S JUST HAVING FUN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.LOUIS _ Roger Maris lost his hair in clumps. Mark McGwire
confessed, only half-jokingly, he can't wait until the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, on the other hand, has said he's on one long
holiday, combining his pursuit of baseball's home run record with a
one-man comedy act that plays to standing room only crowds at every
stop. Even McGwire can't help but enjoy playing straight man to
Sosa's zingers.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter spotted Androstenedione in McGwire's locker and
made it a national story last month, Sosa responded by putting a
bottle of Flintstones vitamins in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure they work,'' Sosa said with that smile seen
coast-to-coast nightly on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa arrived in St. Louis on Monday to meet McGwire head-to-head
in the home-run chase and the two actually had some fun in a joint
pregame news conference. But Sosa led the way, refusing to get
flustered even when asked if the high number of home runs hit this
year cheapened the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish for the rest of the year I hit one cheap one every
day,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was asked if he had ever envisioned as a child that he
would be in this position. Doing his best ``Saturday Night Live''
imitation, Sosa, again breaking into a smile, said, ``Not really
but I have to say ... `Baseball being very very good to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa's sense of humor and easy graciousness during the
home-run chase have also made him a big hit in the United States.
Albert Belle he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in tribute to that, Monday's crowd of 50,530 at Busch
Stadium gave Sosa a standing ovation when he came to bat in the
first inning. Sosa, reveling in the moment, stepped out of the
batter's box, tipped his batting helmet and waved.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said before Monday's game, ``Wouldn't it be great if we
ended up tied? I think it would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sosa, ``What number?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy is a good one,''McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take it,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the news conference, McGwire was talking
about all the trouble Roger Maris went through in 1961 and said,
``Hopefully the day that I die I can, after seeing the Lord, I can
see him and Babe Ruth and talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa broke in and said, ``Don't forget about me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire laughed and said, ``I think you're a little younger than
me. You might come a couple years later.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was also asked Monday what advice he would give to
children who want to be big league ballplayers. His answer seemed
to sum up what Sosa has done this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just have fun,'' McGwire said. ``Just have fun. That is all
you can do is have fun ... because it's serious enough when you get
up here.''

AFTER LOSS, MONDESI MAKES DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ After five months of upheaval and disarray, the
Dodgers already might have their first disaster for the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi said after Monday's 4-2 Dodgers loss to the
expansion Arizona Diamonbacks that he doesn't want to play center
field anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who has developed into perhaps the National League's
best all-around centerfielder, has missed the past three games with
lower back soreness. He said one is related to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do this anymore, I want to go back to right field
where I won two Gold Gloves,'' said Mondesi, who said he hopes to
play tonight against the Diamondbacks. ``That isn't too much to
ask. That is where I am best.''
</P>
<P>
   It is fine for the final 17 games of the season, since
right-fielder Gary Sheffield is gone for the year with a sprained
left ankle And once the Dodgers are mathematically eliminated,
Mondesi might shut it down as well.
</P>
<P>
   But who plays right could be the first problem to be addressed
in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is in the middle of a six-year $61 million contract
that was bumped to $68 when he waived his no trade clause after the
May 15 Mike Piazza deal with Florida. He was the Dodgers only
All-Star and was leading the team in average and RBI when he
sprained his ankle August 30 against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi is in the second year of a four-year $36 million
contract with two option years that could push the deal to $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would like to build the team around Mondesi (ital)
and (off) Sheffield. But Mondesi, who leads the Dodgers with 29
homers and has tied Sheffield with 85 RBI, has completely broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   Before spending the past three days in the trainers room,
Mondesi went 2 for 18 with no homers and two RBI in his previous
five games. But manager Glenn Hoffman was encouraged when Mondesi
took batting practice Monday for the first time since last
Wednesday. Hoffman said if Mondesi is ready, he will start in right
field tonight with Trenidad Hubbard in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the demands of the position are enormous,'' Hoffman
said. ``You back up every play, you're running all the time. But
the guy is our centerfielder. He's one of the best in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi also is missing, and his absence was all over Monday
night's loss to the Diamondbacks' Andy Benes (12-13), who came in
just 5-9 lifetime against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona took advantage of mistakes by Dodgers right-hander
Dave Mlicki, (8-7) who allowed three of the Diamondbacks' runs to
score with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a two-out homer to shortstop Tony Batista in the
first inning and a two-out, two-run single to left-fielder David
Dellucci in the fifth. Mlicki, who entered the game 7-2 since
joining the Dodgers on June 4 as part of the Hideo Nomo trade,
didn't help himself by allowing a single to Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't throw that bad a game, but you look at just a
few pitches in key situations and he didn't get it done,'' Hoffman
said. ``He's been one of our best, but tonight he didn't make some
big pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Any loss is bad to the expansion Diamondbacks, who actually have
a better record (58-87) that two established NL clubs, Montreal and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But this could have been worse. Eric Karros hit his 22 homer of
the season to open the ninth off Gregg Olson. It extended Karros'
hitting streak to nine games, but Olson retired the final three
batters to record his 27th save of the year and the 200th for his
career.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where the Dodgers should play Sheffield next season,
Mondesi said, ``They could do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield began his career as a shortstop and played left field
during one plus seasons with the San Diego Padres (1992-93).
</P>
<P>
   But he has developed into one of the better all around
right-fielders and a definite plus during this sorry season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi acknowledged he enjoys the adulation he has received
over making a successful switch to center. But the back pain flared
up just before the All-Star game and has lingered ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the move because of the trade; I wanted to help the
team,'' Mondesi said. ``But the running has worn me out. I'm not
helping the team. I've never had back problems before and now this.
It's time to put me back where I belong.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FARGO, N.D. _ Bill Weaver remembers those magical nights back in
the summer of 1961 when he and Rudy Maris used to sit in front of
the ticker-tape machine in his office and wait for the infernal
thing to tap out messages one letter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy was the father of Roger Maris, who was making his run back
then at Babe Ruth's home-run record, and Weaver, now retired, was a
radio and TV broadcaster who worked for the local NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it was nothing like it is today,'' Weaver said.
``You didn't have constant coverage on the radio and TV. There
weren't satellites or anything like that where you could tune in
and see the games live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, this was the biggest sports story to ever hit
Fargo, probably all of North and South Dakota. Roger was one of our
boys, and so it was the kind of thing where everybody in town
couldn't wait to get the latest news on what he did each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the way through the season, when it was pretty clear
that Roger was going to have a chance at Ruth, I had the
ticker-tape machine installed in my office. It was our fastest link
to what was happening with the Yankees. But by today's standards,
of course, it was slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day or night, when the Yankees were playing, Rudy and I
would sit in the office and just watch that machine go, `tick . . .
tick . . . tick' and type out when something happened or at the end
of each inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have our chairs up there real close to the machine, and
we'd see it start to go, `tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . HR . . .
tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . NYY . . . tick . . . M . . . tick
. . . A,' and we'd be going crazy with anticipation, waiting to see
if the next letter was an R or an N. Maris or (Mickey) Mantle, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Rudy Maris and Weaver knew, so would all of Fargo.
Because Weaver would run from his office right into the studio, and
the TV station would break into the middle of any programming for
an update.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made up slides to show on camera,'' Weaver said. ``You
know, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61. And we'd cut right into whatever was on
TV at the time. It didn't matter if it was an NBC network show.
Roger knocked it right off the air in Fargo. It was the most
exciting time of my 28-year career.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, like a lot of old fighter pilots, has trouble with his
hearing. To talk to him on the telephone, you have to play a game
of tag and use his wife as an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   But get him warmed up on the subject of Maris, and the words
come out in spitfire fashion, like the rat-a-tat-tat of the
tailguns from those missions he flew in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver had come home from the war and settled into his radio and
TV job when he first came across the young Maris while doing
play-by-play work for the Shanley High football and basketball
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was a real good athlete in both of those sports,''
Weaver said. ``He was tall enough to be a good basketball player,
and he could really run with the football. I know there are a lot
of the stories about how he might have been a great football
player. I don't know. Bud Wilkinson did offer him a scholarship to
Oklahoma. But he lasted only two weeks down there. Got a little
homesick. I don't know if he could have been a great one at the top
level of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was never much doubt when he started playing pro
baseball. I really got to know Roger in his first year in the
Northern League (with the Fargo-Moorhead Twins). He was the MVP,
and they won the league title. Not much of a doubt he'd make it
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Little doubt, too, in the minds of longtime friends like Weaver,
that Maris was never appreciated for simply being down-to-earth and
uninterested in playing the role of an icon like Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as humble as any human being I've ever met,'' Weaver
said. ``He never talked about breaking the record and was always a
great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a phone call in October of 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger wanted me to come to the World Series in New York,''
Weaver remembered. ``I told him I only worked at a tiny TV station,
and I didn't think that kind of money was in the budget. He told me
there would be two plane tickets waiting for me and my wife, and
they were on him. So we spent four nights in the Manhattan Hotel,
where the Yankees were staying during the Series, and had a great
time. Then I went to pay the bill for the room and our meals, and
the desk clerk said, `You don't owe anything. It was all paid by
Mr. Maris.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time earlier this summer when Weaver taped an
interview with ESPN and said, ``If anybody around here told me they
wanted to see Roger's record broken, I'd have to take them in the
back alley.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the relentless charge of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa has
turned the improbable into the inevitable, Weaver and others close
to Maris have mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like they say, all records are made to be broken,'' he said.
``If the record has to fall, then I'm just glad it's going to go to
McGwire or to Sosa. They are both very classy. They have both held
Roger and Babe Ruth in great respect all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes, then the positive thing to come out of all this is
that for the past year Roger's name has been back in the headlines
in newspapers from all over the country. Instead of Fargo being
forgotten, it's like we've all been rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will help Roger get into the Hall of Fame. There's
a new member of the veterans committee, you know. It's Yogi Berra.
So I think we have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The old fighter pilot-turned-broadcaster paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has actually been a lot of fun,'' he said.
``Looking back at that year. Remembering Roger. Picturing that
perfect swing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the nights with Rudy Maris in front of that machine.
</P>
<P>
   Tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . HR . . . NYY . . . M . . . tick

ST. LOUIS _ He pointed to the sky. He pointed to the Roger Maris
family. He pointed to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, even though it was only the first inning of a
game that was supposed to feature so many home runs, so many
records, so many cheers, there would be no more.
</P>
<P>
   It would be only No. 61 on this day. It would be only Mark
McGwire and Roger Maris, joined together for one day. It would be a
booming shot by the Cardinals slugger in the first inning and the
cheers that Maris never heard wafting down on his family and making
them feel that, yes, if the record is to be broken, it should be
done by this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe Roger Maris is with me right now,'' McGwire
would say of the former Yankees great, who often walked alone as he
chased the record McGwire now seems sure to break. ``He's been with
me through all this. He's walking with me through this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a day when the Cubs' Sammy Sosa would
march toward history with McGwire, two sluggers hammering baseballs
into oblivion, carving a double-edged legend.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was supposed to hit maybe one home run on this day,
maybe two, maybe three. Smash the record. Step right past Maris.
And Sosa, who has been linked at the adjective with McGwire since
early in the season _ great, super, remarkable _ would follow suit.
It was supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty times already, one of these baseball giants has hit a
home run in a game, only to see the other match or better the shot
on the same day. In a game between their teams at Chicago's Wrigley
Field last month, Sosa passed McGwire in the home-run chase, only
to see Big Mac slam a pair of homers later in the afternoon to
regain the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa entered Monday's game with 58 home runs, McGwire 60. Sosa
had nine homers in his previous 14 games, McGwire 13 in his
previous 19. It was McGwire and Sosa, Sosa and McGwire, a
double-edged legend in the making.
</P>
<P>
   But for one day, McGwire shared the stage not with Sosa, not
with Babe Ruth, not with anyone but Maris. McGwire seemed honored,
if not divinely touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel for what Roger Maris went through, all the
negative stuff that was going on in his life when he broke the
record,'' McGwire said. ``I wish it hadn't happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did, beginning with the misguided edict from
then-commissioner Ford Frick, who announced that unless Maris broke
Ruth's magical mark of 60 homers in 154 games or fewer, an asterisk
would be placed by his name in the record book. It was a slap in
the face. How could Maris be blamed for the extension of the season
from 154 games to 162?
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the public's love for the legendary Ruth, Maris'
march to history consequently was not hailed and revered like
McGwire's and Sosa's, but questioned.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1961, when Maris finally hit No. 61, barely 23,000
fans attended the game at Yankee Stadium. The cheers were cordial
but not warm.
</P>
<P>
   Maris remained proud of the mark until he died of cancer in
1985, but he was a reticent, mistreated hero, a reluctant North
Dakota man who never heard the kind of cheers McGwire heard Monday,
the kind of cheers McGwire tried to share with Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking the record never really was a fond memory for my dad
at all,'' Roger Maris Jr. said. ``That's what was disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps that is why there might be something to that special
feeling McGwire said he felt Monday, that feeling that Maris was
there with him, finally trotting around the bases to the thunder of
sincere applause.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that always bothered Maris, according to his son, was
that no one on the opposing Boston Red Sox ever congratulated Maris
when he hit No. 61 _ not when he trotted around the bases, not
after the game, not ever.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cubs first baseman Mark Grace slapped McGwire's hand
as he trotted around; third baseman Gary Gaetti shook his hand;
Sosa, in right field, shook his fist in the air and began
applauding into his glove. Between innings, Cubs second baseman
Mickey Morandini congratulated McGwire, and after the game several
Cubs players did the same. And this on a day when Chicago's one-run
loss dropped it out of sole possession of the National League
wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a feeling of awe,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for McGwire and Maris. As he floated toward the
dugout amid the madness after slamming the record-tying shot,
McGwire paused and looked toward the seats where Roger Maris Jr.
and his brothers and sisters sat. He pointed to the sky. He pointed
to the Maris family. He pointed to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, McGwire walked up to Roger Jr. and hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is in my heart,'' McGwire told Roger Jr. ``I know he's
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris Jr. nodded his head and bit his bottom lip.
</P>
<P>
   The only man who really knows what it is like to hit 61 home
runs in a single season, to endure the road, the scrutiny, finally
gave Maris what he deserved. He shared the day with him.

SAMPRAS KEEPS THE FUTURE IN ITS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the sky went from gray to green to black on
Monday afternoon, Pete Sampras looked up, registered moderate
apprehension and played on. After all, the spotlights were eerily
blazing inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, and he was scant serves away
from taking a 6-4, 2-1 lead over Marat Safin in a match that
eventually became a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 rout and landed the four-time
champion in the U.S. Open quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the rest of the men's matches were washed out,
leaving the stubborn Sampras a solitary quarterfinalist. On the
women's side, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, fourth-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, fifth-seeded Venus Williams and
13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer had enough time between cloudbursts to
attain the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to a less violent but persistent return of the rain on
Monday night, Sampras never did learn the identity of his
adversary: Andre Agassi had just finagled his way out of a
two-sets-to-none predicament against another king of unreturnable
returns, ninth-seeded Karol Kucera, when their mean-spirited Round
of 16 clash was postponed with Agassi up by 3-0 in the fourth set
after scrambling through the third, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the eighth-seeded Agassi's initial lack of
composure on the same court where he won his only Open championship
in 1994, Kucera had outplayed Agassi with impunity to claim the
first two sets, 6-3, 6-3, in Louis Armstrong Stadium. The tide
turned when Agassi, annoyed by Kucera's tendency to repeatedly toss
the ball on his serve, began mimicking the Slovak's finicky
behavior and knotted the third set at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   While it took only a nighttime sprinkling to drive Agassi and
Kucera from their match, in Sampras' case, it was a midafternoon
monsoon in the second set. But Sampras, with his tunnel vision
intact, was not budging until he had to. ``It was a scary sight,''
he said later, ``really, it was like green out there. It was. Maybe
it was going to rain money.''
</P>
<P>
   The harried tournament officials, warned by their in-house radar
that a storm on the scale of the humdinger that sent Dorothy to Oz
was on the doorstep, had shut down the day session on a dozen
courts, including the stadium where Williams, last year's
runner-up, was halfway through a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) defeat of
12th-seeded Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   But the one court they had not evacuated was their biggest, Ashe
Stadium, and their frantic signals there from the sidelines to
Sampras on the service line went ignored until he had secured his
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the loudspeaker ordered spectators to do what the
electronic message on the scoreboard had been suggesting for 45
minutes: leave their seats and seek shelter from a hard-driving
thunderstorm, which was five minutes from striking the National
Tennis Center. The evacuation went smoothly with the exception of
minor injuries sustained by two spectators who ventured outside
amid the wind and lightning and fell on the rain-slicked concourse.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour delay, the squeegee patrol dried the courts and
Sampras, Safin and the rest were back in business.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Safin, the 18-year-old Russian sensation, did not
take much time to complete their encounter. Sampras, who spewed 18
aces to 10 by his outclassed challenger, needed just 1 hour 17
minutes to send the teen-ager back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to improve many things to be like Pete,'' Safin said.
``He played tennis perfect, almost perfect. He has unbelievable
serve; he put many pressures all the time because he's moving to
the net all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Davis Cup debut this spring, Safin took Jim Courier to
five sets before losing the deciding match, and a month later he
defeated Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, but Safin
described Sampras as an opponent from a superior planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer I play against the guys who are more or less my
level; this unbelievable level is No. 1 in the world, it was
impossible to break him,'' Safin said. ``To be half of Pete Sampras
is enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, Safin is already a better player at 18
than he was. ``I was pretty flaky; I'm not really sure at that
point what I really wanted from tennis, I was still trying to make
my mark, still trying to break into the top 50, the top 20, and I
did that just about when I turned 19 and won here,'' Sampras said
of his first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is three rounds from a fifth Open championship, which
would tie him with Jimmy Connors for the Open record and tie him
with Roy Emerson for the men's lead in Grand Slam titles. Sampras
would not say that his flirtation with the record books is causing
undue stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wimbledon was a huge confidence booster,'' said Sampras, who
tied Bjorn Borg's record five titles there by defending his 1997
title and defeating Goran Ivanisevic in the final. ``I feel pretty
relaxed. Now at 27, I've been through enough situations to
hopefully handle it. Whoever I play, I feel like I'm ready,'' he
said, referring to his imminent quarterfinal against Agassi, his
victim in the 1990 and 1995 Open finals, or Kucera, who dethroned
him at the Australian Open earlier this year.

MORGAN'S `STRENGTH' IS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Chicago Cubs pitcher Mike Morgan had a count of one
ball and one strike to Mark McGwire in the first inning Monday.
Catcher Scott Servais signaled for a slider.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan shook his head no.
</P>
<P>
   Servais signaled for a split-fingered fastball. Morgan said no
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come with my strength,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a regular fastball, one that the radar clocked at 84
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get it low and away,'' Morgan said. ``I didn't get
it where I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he put the pitch where McGwire wanted it, and the St.
Louis Cardinals first baseman hit it into the left-field bleachers
for his record-tying 61st home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling myself get a good pitch to hit,'' McGwire
said. ``I went after the first pitch; it was a slider. The second
pitch was a fastball that stayed up. And then it was just another
fastball that stayed up, and I just got the head on it real well,
hit it down the line, and it went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who made his major-league debut with the Oakland
Athletics at age 18 in 1978, will be known as the pitcher who
served up McGwire's record-tying home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit 61 of them,'' Morgan said. ``I came here to do a job
for the Chicago Cubs and to give them a chance to win. I think I
did that for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, whose team is tied with the New York Mets in the
National League wild-card race, allowed three hits in six innings.
But one of the hits was a home run by Cardinals catcher Eli
Marrero, and Morgan was the losing pitcher in the Cubs' 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have that pitch back,'' Morgan said. ``I'd like to
have Marrero's pitch back. But when you're talking about one or two
pitches over the course of a ballgame, you just have to tip your
cap to them.''

THREE EX-PLAYERS TALK ABOUT McGWIRE  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Mark McGwire caught Roger Maris Monday in his Labor Day
showdown against Sammy Sosa, I decided to consult three Long Beach,
Calif., natives, Bob Bailey, Bobby Grich and Jeff Burroughs, on the
home run duel that has, blessedly, developed into a greater
national obsession than Clinton's fib about Monica.
</P>
<P>
   This trio has more than a passing interest on the subject,
inasmuch as they all had lengthy major league careers and they all
hit with power as evidenced by their aggregate total of 653 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what McGwire and Sosa are doing has been phenomenal,''
said Bailey from his residence in Las Vegas. ``It's just been great
for the game. The whole country is talking baseball, and when was
the last time you can remember that happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been fantastic. ... I don't think anyone has
realized that the football season has started,'' said Grich from
his home in Coto de Caza near Mission Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this has been just great for baseball,'' said
Burroughs, who still resides in Long Beach. ``I've noticed even
some of the newscasts leading off with it. It's resulted in great
publicity for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men have their theories for the recent upsurge of home
runs in their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt the pitching is down because of expansion,'' said
Bailey, a 1961 Wilson High graduate who hit 189 home runs in his
17-year career, with a high of 28 in 1970 with the Montreal Expos.
``But in all fairness, the strike zone is a joke. The umps don't
call high strikes anymore, or inside strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of four reasons for the eruption in home runs,''
said Grich, a 1967 Wilson High graduate who hit 224 home runs in
his 17-year career, with a high of 30 in 1979 for the Angels.
``One, I think years of work in the weight room are paying
dividends for the players. Two, the ball is livelier. Three, the
parks are now smaller. And, four, the pitching talent is smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the pitching is thinner,'' said
Burroughs, a 1969 Wilson High graduate who hit 240 home runs in his
16-year career, including a high of 41 in 1978 for the Atlanta
Braves. ``But I think the biggest difference is the ball. They're
now using a much livelier one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember they brought some balls over from Japan once in
spring training it was either in 1974 or 1975 and everyone was
hitting home runs. We had a game in Ft. Meyers, and a shortstop
named Eddie Brinkman, who hit about two or three home runs a year,
hit one about 475 feet over the light standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an Old Timer's game I participated in at the Sky Dome in
Toronto, we used juiced-up balls in batting practice, and I hit
several into the upper deck in left field.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's a juiced-up ball?
</P>
<P>
   ``The strings inside are wound much tighter,'' said Burroughs.
``The ball's just much harder, and explodes off the bat. And goes a
lot farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bailey, Bobby Grich and Jeff Burroughs all marvel at the
distance so many of the home runs travel these days, including most
of the ones deposited by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days when I played, it was a big deal when someone
would hit a home run to the opposite field,'' said Bailey. ``Willie
Mays was the only one who did it consistently, and he was forced to
because the wind blew out to right and right centerfield at
Candlestick Park, and blew in from leftfield. Now I see little
second basemen swing late, and hit the ball into the stands in the
opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farthest I've ever seen a ball hit came at old Forbes
Field in Pittsburgh when Hank Aaron hit one over the iron gate in
rightcenterfield that was about 457 feet away. The farthest I ever
hit one was at the Houston Astrodome. I hit it into the yellow
seats in left field, about 450 feet away. A garden variety home run
for McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played in Baltimore, center field at our stadium was
about 405 feet, and I only saw five balls make it over it,''
related Grich. ``I remember seeing Frank Robinson, Boog Powell and
Frank Howard clearing it, but that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest ball I've ever saw hit came at old Comiskey Park
in Chicago when Dick Allen put one of Mike Cuellar's screwballs
over the roof and out of the park in left field. It had to travel
at least 475 feet. The longest ball I ever hit came at the Oakland
Coliseum. I hit it into the left field stands about 430 feet
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally amazed by the distances guys hit the baseballs
today,'' said Burroughs. ``I'm sure when a guy doesn't hit a home
run more than 400 feet now, he probably doesn't even think he hit
it well. When I played, guys just hit the ball over the fence and
that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you'd see a long one once in a while. I'll never forget
the longest one I saw when Frank Howard reached the upper deck at
RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. It was about 480 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest ball I ever hit came at Arlington Stadium when I
was with the Texas Rangers. It came against Rollie Fingers, and
traveled about 450 feet. I got all of it. Mark McGwire seems to do
that 10 or 12 times a day in batting practice.''

HELLING'S THREE-HIT SHUTOUT LIFTS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Manager Johnny Oates does not know whether his Texas
Rangers will be involved in either of the American League's
best-of-five, divisional playoff series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, hinted Monday that Rick Helling likely will be
the Rangers' starting pitcher for Game 1 of that series should the
Rangers capture the AL West title and not need the right-hander for
their final regular-season game Sept. 27 in Seattle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling demonstrated why during the Rangers' 6-0 victory against
the Minnesota Twins Monday at The Ballpark in Arlington. The
27-year-old became the league's fourth 18-game winner with a
three-hit, complete-game effort that ended the Rangers' two-game
losing streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Rangers within three games of the idle
Angels in the AL West and alleviated the sting of defeats Saturday
and Sunday. The Rangers entered the eighth inning of both those
games with a two-run advantage, and Oates wondered before Monday's
game which reliever would be summoned to pitch the eighth inning if
needed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Rick Helling answered that question in big style,''
Oates said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling (18-7) threw a string of zeroes at the Twins until the
Rangers took advantage of two seventh-inning errors for their first
run against right-hander LaTroy Hawkins (7-14). Third baseman Luis
Alicea and center fielder Tom Goodwin later delivered run-scoring
singles in the inning, and second baseman Mark McLemore and right
fielder Juan Gonzalez capped the six-run outburst with home runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed six baserunners, only two of whom reached second
base, and recorded eight strikeouts during his economical,
115-pitch appearance on an afternoon in which the thermometer
registered 94 degrees at game time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been outstanding all year,'' said first baseman Lee
Stevens, who opened the seventh inning with a leadoff double and
scored the game's first run. ``He always seems to pick us up on
days when we need it. He also kept us off the field and out of the
heat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heat of this title race prompted Oates to alter his rotation
to ensure that Helling and right-hander Aaron Sele pitch every
fifth day the remainder of the season. Oates finalized the plan
Wednesday in Detroit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect,'' Oates recalled telling himself after
formulating the rotation's course for the remainder of the season.
``Helling gets an extra start, and he gets to pitch against the
Angels twice. He's also available to pitch on the final day of the
regular season if we need him. If we don't need him, he can have
the first playoff game. This is too good to be true.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling continues to demonstrate that he deserves to be
considered the Rangers' big-game pitcher. Helling beat the Mariners
and their former ace, left-hander Randy Johnson, in May. He beat
the Angels and their ace, left-hander Chuck Finley, twice in June.
It did not stop there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling beat the Red Sox and right-hander Pedro Martinez in
August, and Monday's performance prevented a three-game losing
streak after agonizing defeats the previous two evenings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to win the division,'' Oates said.
``I don't have that crystal ball, but I think today showed that
this group plays with character and integrity in spite of the
doubters and naysayers, and there are a lot of them around here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling hushed such discussions at least for one September
afternoon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I've prided myself on is that I've always been
healthy and durable,'' Helling said after the Rangers won for the
22nd time in his 30 starts. ``I've always had better second halves
than first halves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will call upon that at least three and maybe four
more times this month and perhaps again during Game 1 of a playoff
series.

COWBOYS SIGN BACKUP QUARTERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 SIGNING-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys signed free-agent Jim Miller
to a one-year, $300,000 deal as their No. 3 quarterback, his agent
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones confirmed that Miller has signed, saying
the deal is contingent on Miller passing a physical, which he took
last night. The Cowboys probably will release rookie quarterback
Daniel Gonzalez to make room for Miller on the roster, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Joe Linta said that the Cowboys called Monday to work out
the contract and that Miller is expected to join the team Tuesday.
Detroit released Miller two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year veteran spent his first three seasons with
Pittsburgh when Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey was there. His
knowledge of Gailey's offense made him attractive to the Cowboys,
who said last week they would be re-evaluating the
third-quarterback job after the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity with the offense also swayed the deal for Miller,
who also drew interest from Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the system and with a few days of work could be ready
to play on Sunday,'' Linta said. ``It's the perfect place for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 210-pound Miller, who played at Michigan State,
has completed 45 of 81 passes for 520 yards with five interceptions
in his career. He has one career start.

THE COWBOYS ARE BACK? CHECK BACK IN 16 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was only one game.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the feeling Monday at the Dallas Cowboys' Valley Ranch
headquarters regarding the 38-10 season-opening drubbing of the
Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the rout ushered in the Chan Gailey era on a positive note
and ended the Cowboys' five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But as guard Nate Newton said, ``we are not going to go jump off
a building.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton cited Sunday's upcoming game against the defending Super
Bowl-champion Denver Broncos and last season's experience of
opening with a 37-7 rout of Pittsburgh only to follow with a loss
to the Cardinals en route to a 6-10 record. This time, he said, the
Cowboys are keeping everything in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one game,'' Newton said. ``That's just one win. We
got to play an even tougher team this week. And what happened last
year should keep us humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players pointed to last season after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case the message didn't get across, Gailey, who was on
the Steelers' sideline last year, also brought up 1997's turn of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of 16,'' Gailey said. ``One game doesn't make
or break a season. I'm sure they remembered last year. But I talked
about it anyway. One win is great, but it's only one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also helping temper the Cowboys' enthusiasm is the fact that
they did not play a mistake-free game, which included 10 penalties
against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the offensive totals _ the 38 points were the most in
the regular season for the Cowboys since a 42-31 victory against
Green Bay in 1994, and the 444 yards were the most since they
totaled 482 against Miami in 1996 _ Gailey said the team has a long
way to go in learning his offense.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to do was point to the Cowboys' first five
possessions. The first three ended with punts after a total of 11
plays. The next two were halted by an interception and a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the offense turned it around because the players
were persistent. Though the first quarter looked a lot like the
Cowboys' preseason struggles, the offense got a chance to work
through the mistakes on field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed the offense could put it together,'' said Gailey,
who said the Cowboys used only 30 percent of the new offense
against the Cardinals. ``The defense played good long enough to
allow the offense to get a comfort level. The game worked out where
we could be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said the performance helps the team's
confidence but cautioned that ``we still got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the area needing the most work is the inside running
game, despite the big day from running back Emmitt Smith (29
carries, 124 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Of Smith's 29 carries, 14 netted 3 yards or less, and most of
his success came on outside runs.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said it was no coincidence that the Cowboys did better on
the ground after Cardinals defensive tackle Eric Swann was ejected
in the first quarter for fighting with Cowboys tackle Erik
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys made up for their slow start on the
ground with big plays, but said ``in order for us to be a solid
offense, we have to be more consistent'' running the ball.

TEXAS QB EAGER FOR SHOT AT REDEMPTION AGAINST UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Technically, he has a higher winning percentage
as Texas' starting quarterback (.667) than his celebrated
predecessor, who left after four seasons with 30 school records.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Walton realizes that, for the foreseeable future,
Longhorns' fans will recognize him for two reasons: He's the guy
replacing James Brown, a four-year starter who set school records
for passing yards and total offense. And he's the quarterback who
lost to UCLA, 66-3, in the most lopsided home football defeat in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, a fifth-year senior, gets a chance to avenge the lone
loss on his 2-1 career record when No. 23 Texas (1-0) meets No. 6
UCLA (0-0) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Pasadena, Calif. By doing so,
Walton can alter what stands as his legacy as a college
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people blame that on me,'' Walton said of the team's
signature defeat of a 4-7 season that led to the reassignment of
former coach John Mackovic. ``That was a shock to me and the whole
team. After that game, some of the coaches said they could tell by
the way I carried myself that I'd lost my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton never bought into that theory. But it did not prevent
members of Mackovic's staff, who watched Walton commit two
turnovers in two quarters before departing with a 24-0 deficit,
from limiting his practice repetitions and playing time the rest of
the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed former coaches wrote him off as a college
quarterback after his dismal performance in relief of an injured
Brown against UCLA, Walton nodded and said: ``They might have.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the final chapter on Walton's career has been rewritten
by first-year coach Mack Brown. Given the starting job in spring
drills and force-fed a new offense during fall two-a-days, Walton
responded with a career-best effort in the team's season opener. He
completed 15 of 21 passes for 282 yards and a touchdown in a 66-36
rout of New Mexico State. He was not sacked and did not throw an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive to teammates, Walton delivered several strikes a
split-second before being belted by blitzing linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a better feeling as a quarterback than to get
nailed but listen to the crowd cheer as you're laying on the
ground,'' said Walton, a 6-foot-5, 225-pounder from Bay City. ``I
felt that a couple of times against New Mexico State. When that
happens, you don't even notice the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates, in turn, noticed a leader they were not sure they
would find. They knew he had the talent, offensive guard Ben Adams
said. But the quiet and reflective Walton, who aspires to be a
doctor rather than an NFL quarterback, brings a different persona
to the huddle than Brown, who led the Longhorns to a 25-13-1 record
from 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``James could throw two consecutive interceptions and still come
off as cocky. That was just his demeanor and it showed he was a
leader back there,'' Adams said. ``The thing I worried about with
Richard was him not having confidence in himself. Before this game,
he'd had a tough career. He needed a game to get back on track and
get in rhythm to show people he deserved to be back there as Texas'
starting quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton sold Brown with a first-quarter audible on third-and-3
that resulted in a 29-yard completion to Bryan White, setting up
Texas' first touchdown. The play, as relayed from the sideline by
Texas coaches, called for on off-tackle blast by tailback Ricky
Williams, who rushed for 215 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was mad. It was like, `Oh, no, Richard! ... Hey,
great throw!''' Brown said. ``He checked off five or six times
during the game and did a great job with it. He seems relaxed out
there and I like his attitude. It's kind of early for him to be
going up against a team like UCLA, but I'm anxious to see how he
handles it. I think he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton put it in stronger terms. Every time he reflects on the
1997 season, he said he thinks of the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That personified the season for me. And I don't want to ever
go through another season like that,'' said Walton, who watched the
Longhorns set up 42 UCLA points with eight turnovers. ``I don't
have any doubts about my ability to do this job. If there's one
thing I'm going to focus on against UCLA, from a personal
standpoint, it's to come out without a turnover. If we can avoid
turnovers and force them to make some, I think we can beat them
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walton, once-buried backup, has been given a blank page
to rewrite his legacy as a Longhorns quarterback. Appropriately
enough, the next chapter starts with UCLA.

WEST INDIAN PARADE IS AN INVITATION TO DANCE AND DON COSTUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th graf to correct crowd estimate) (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Normally, Marjorie Smith, 50, is a manager of the
administrative staff at the World Bank in Washington, an office
where people are not known for excessive dress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Ms. Smith, who was born in Trinidad, got herself
into an enormous blue-and-white feathered costume, had her face
painted to match, then danced down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.
``This is my stress-buster,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the theme of the 31st annual West Indian
American Day Carnival, a pageant that has surpassed the
Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day parades as the largest and most
elaborate in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the two-mile route stretching along Eastern Parkway from
Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, in Brooklyn's Caribbean heart,
was jammed with revelers. They ate jerk chicken, curried goat and
black pudding, dressed up in thongs and as peacocks, and danced to
a throbbing calypso beat on trucks advertising Guinness stout and
Hennessey cognac. On Monday night, the police did not have a firm
estimate of how many people attended.
</P>
<P>
   The day was stifling until showers cooled things off. The mood
was an island sultriness combined with aggressive New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy six beers, and I'll get you a free face painting,'' said a
vendor, Jerry Vento, 27, of Canarsie, as a woman passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six beers _ you can paint my body, baby,'' the woman shot
back.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is the biggest event of the year for New York's
burgeoning West Indian community, whose numbers are estimated at
600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wait for this,'' said Reshonah Bennett, 22, a student at
Manhattan's Fashion Institute of Technology. ``Fall is coming, so
it's like a brand new start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bennett was born in the United States, but her parents were
born in Trinidad, and on Monday she and four other families from
the second floor of her Eastern Parkway apartment building were
selling food and drinks along the parade route. They hoped to make
$3,000, and expected to be out there until 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Baker, 39, of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, was
selling jerk chicken on the parade route for a Flatbush catering
service called Goodies, and dancing at the same time. She came to
New York from Jamaica two years ago, and misses home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get the chance to get the spirit of the old
things,'' she said. ``And you can behave in a way that people don't
think is strange. It gives us a chance to be Jamaican.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Baker works part-time as a nanny on Long Island, which has
made her wonder about why people here work so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you see the wealth, the people don't act like
there's wealth,'' she said. ``People get up in the morning and go
to work and then they come home late at night. But at home, we have
a lifestyle. You go to work, you leave, and you might call your
friends up. We have a lot of entertainment places along the
beaches. Or you might meet at a pool. It's definitely less
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual clutch of politicians made pilgrimages to the parade
site. Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, who is running for the U.S.
Senate, turned up in a coat and tie, but was later spotted in a
``Taste of the Tropics'' T-shirt as he waved from the top of a
double-decker bus and swayed gingerly to the calypso beat.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is running for governor, wore
a blue business suit and blue pumps and danced down the street with
the Mystic Promise band. ``We're teaching her,'' said Tessa Caesar,
24, a member of the band.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot for sale, like pina coladas served in
pineapples, dolls, jewelry, wood carvings, and clothes. Among the
T-shirt slogans: ``When I Die &AMP; Heaven Doesn't Want Me, Take Me
Straight to Trinidad''; ``Trini to the Last Drop'' and ``Every
Sister Should Have a BMW _ Black Man Working!''
</P>
<P>
   The skies above the parade darkened ominously at 2:30 p.m., and
soon after that, they opened, sending some people screaming for the
subways. Others ran for cover under the nearest food stall tent,
which created some interesting groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Up near the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Patricia Brown found herself
covering up the carrot cake she was selling and standing in her
tent next to Sonya Smith, 29, a woman who calls people who have not
paid their Bell Atlantic phone bills; Ms. Smith's son, Deshawn, 9;
a man without a shirt who would not tell anyone his name; and a
newspaper reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she led spiritual and holistic retreats back home
to Jamaica, and loved the West Indian parade.
</P>
<P>
   As it rained, the man who would not give his name made a garbage
bag raincoat for Deshawn, who was cold. ``That's $500, custom,''
the man said. ``This is an original. Stop shivering.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he inexplicably started haranguing the group about Monica
Lewinsky. Ms. Smith rolled her eyes. ``Wrong event,'' she said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bureaucracy is going nuttty
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Sept. 9, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWS ITEM: The U.S. Department of Transportation has ordered
airlines to create peanut-free buffer zones on flights when a
person with an allergy to peanuts is aboard _ one row in front of
the allergic person, one row behind and, of course, the row the
allergic person is sitting in.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Department of Transportation: I'd like to speak with you
about perfume _ perfume in airplanes, specifically the row in front
of me, the row in back of me and, of course, the row I'm sitting
in. And, if your powers also embrace elevators, I'd like to talk
with you about perfume in those closed-in mechanisms, and where may
I write about perfume in restaurants; would that be the Food and
Drug Administration?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, brother, where do we draw the line?
</P>
<P>
   As a person with allergies, I have empathy for people who are
allergic to peanuts. Studies show that all of us opening our
pressurized peanut packs within a limited time frame sends the
allergen coursing throughout the plane's ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
   While peanuts do not bother me, my throat closes when I inhale
someone's perfume. Perfume has long been identified by health
organizations as a frequent trigger of asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there are other people who are adversely affected by
the odor of Parmesan cheese they sprinkle on that dreadful airline
pasta. And I know my wife can't stand the smell of beer, so let's
create another rule about that stuff on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   I loathe echoing Republican populist battle cries, but
government is getting a bit too heavy on my back with the peanut
edict. Never mind that peanut farmers are in a rage _ this never
would have happened under Jimmy Carter's presidency _ the problem
is how far we are going these days.
</P>
<P>
   People are allergic to peanuts, to perfume, to millions of other
things, including all that dust that gathers on airline seats. But
a ban solely on peanuts? Is someone in a very high place allergic
to peanuts?
</P>
<P>
   And what a rule! If a person with documentation that he or she
is allergic to peanuts calls in advance, the airline must provide a
peanut-free zone. Well, I want to do the same about perfume. I've
been on plenty of flights where I was gasping for air because a
perfume-wearer was nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other night, I was sandwiched between two tables in a
trendy restaurant where the fragrance of perfume coming from others
was ruining my dinner. Anybody for a law? Of course not! None of
this _ peanuts or perfume _ is as prevalent as the problem of
second-hand smoke. That's where the line should have been drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Allergy sufferers _ and I am one _ have to come to grips with
reality. We can't make rules for everything.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of a flight I took from Budapest to Moscow about
eight years ago. I had requested seats in the non-smoking section.
As soon as we departed on the Marev Hungarian Airlines flight,
three men across the aisle lit up, not just any cigarettes but
those strong, doubly smelly Russian types.
</P>
<P>
   Choking, I called for the stewardess and, through broken
English, hand signals and heavy smoke, the conversation went
approximately this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for non-smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is non-smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're smoking over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this side of the plane is for non-smoking, the other side
is for smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   You just can't make annoyance rules that will satisfy everyone.
I can do without the peanuts, but that's not the idea. Will someone
else do without the perfume? Or the beer? Or the screaming child?
Or the hair spray?
</P>
<P>
   Where does it end?

 &HT;    COOLNESS COMING TO GEORGE WASHINGTON'S HOME
 &HT;    Repeating in (w) Washington and (t) travel categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 13.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George Washington
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation overlooking
the Potomac River, his house is getting air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer visitors have
sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home of the
nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to keep
guides from fainting in the stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   But a few preservationists are downright hot over the decision
of Mount Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million
computerized climate control system in one of America's most
historic homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've died a thousand times over this,'' said Marc A.
LeFrancois, Mount Vernon's former architectural curator, who
resigned in protest over the air-conditioning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is so important,'' LeFrancois told the Associated
Press. ``To do that much damage for something that may not work,
and probably won't work, is just unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a decision made lightly, conceded James Rees,
resident director of the Mount Vernon Estate and Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1735, Mount Vernon has survived for more than 250 years
without air-conditioning. During the sweltering summers, George and
Martha Washington would dine outside on the portico to catch the
breeze blowing in from the river. He loved the view. ``No estate in
the United States is more pleasantly situated than this,''
Washington wrote in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists today see an estate that is much the same as in
Washington's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon Ladies Association, America's oldest national
historic preservation organization, raised $200,000 to purchase the
500-acre plantation from the first president's great-grandnephew in
the 1850s and has owned and operated it ever since. More than 1
million visitors tour the 18th-century mansion and grounds each
year, making it the nation's second most visited historic home,
ranking behind only the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where the past is revered. George Washington
walked on the hardwood floors, chose the paintings on the parlor
walls, wrote at the desk in the study, ate hoecakes and honey for
breakfast in the small dining room, fretted over the nearby
furrowed fields, and died in the four-poster bed upstairs. Change
does not come easily here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rees went to Rome to check out the Sistine Chapel's new
air-conditioning before agreeing that a similar system would work
at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get to talk to the Pope'' about BTUs and air ducts,
said Rees. But he did hire the same company _ Carrier Corp. _ and
same engineer who designed and installed the system in the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval was granted in June, and the Heating, Ventilation
and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system is scheduled to be operating
this autumn, in time for a year-long bicentennial commemoration of
Washington's death on Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   After years of considering the pros and cons of
air-conditioning, Rees said that technological advances finally
tipped the scales toward installation.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, he acknowledged. The primary problem is
that ``you have to cut through original fabric in the mansion'' to
put in air ducts and other parts of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have decried this ``irreversible'' destruction of
18th-century plaster and wood. ``It's extremely sad,'' Christine
Meadows, a former Mount Vernon curator, told AP.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is not the first time such action has been deemed
necessary, Rees pointed out. The original structure was cut to
install electricity, heating, lighting and fire protection in
earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   He said care is being taken to minimize damage to the original
building and more than half of the air-conditioning vents were put
in without destroying original fabric. The work was done inside
closets and in other hidden areas wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   The second major concern was condensation. Mount Vernon is built
of wood, and its historic planks are vulnerable to water damage.
</P>
<P>
   This is where technology came in, Rees said. The computerized
system will ensure that there is never such a difference in
temperature and humidity to cause condensation. The formula is
complex, said Rees, but basically the range will never be more than
15 degrees when the air-conditioning is on. Thus, if the outside
temperature is 100 degrees, the temperature inside Mount Vernon
will be about 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rate below objects'' in this equation, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The entire project is aimed more at preserving the historic
house and furnishings than at providing comfort for visitors and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summer now, we do what George Washington did _ open the
doors and windows,'' said Rees. ``That lets in dirt and dust and
light,'' all of which can damage the historic furnishings.
Carefully controlling the climate will help preserve the mansion's
artifacts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums and
historic houses will not lend art and furniture that Washington
owned to Mount Vernon because of the uncontrolled environment, said
Rees. Once the HVAC system is working, these traveling exhibits
will enable the curators to make the house even more as it was when
the nation's first First Family lived there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to bring home many of Washington's artifacts
which have been maintained by collectors and museums around the
country,'' said Carter King Laughlin, Mount Vernon's curator.
``Without a modern climate control system, we are limited in the
variety of historical artifacts we can borrow from other
collections to display here.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the pastoral setting, the system's condenser is
located in a wooded area about 200 yards from the mansion, hidden
from visitors by trees. Buried pipes connect it to the underground
air handlers in the site of a former archeological dig about 100
feet from the house. The only visible parts of the system will be
small air vents in ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning should disturb the historic ambiance
considerably less than the current electric fans that circulate the
air in almost every room in the summer, said Rees.

 &HT;    COOLNESS COMING TO GEORGE WASHINGTON'S HOME
 &HT;    Repeating in (w) Washington and (t) travel categories for

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George Washington
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation overlooking
the Potomac River, his house is getting air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer visitors have
sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home of the
nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to keep
guides from fainting in the stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   But a few preservationists are downright hot over the decision
of Mount Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million
computerized climate control system in one of America's most
historic homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've died a thousand times over this,'' said Marc A.
LeFrancois, Mount Vernon's former architectural curator, who
resigned in protest over the air-conditioning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is so important,'' LeFrancois told the Associated
Press. ``To do that much damage for something that may not work,
and probably won't work, is just unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a decision made lightly, conceded James Rees,
resident director of the Mount Vernon Estate and Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1735, Mount Vernon has survived for more than 250 years
without air-conditioning. During the sweltering summers, George and
Martha Washington would dine outside on the portico to catch the
breeze blowing in from the river. He loved the view. ``No estate in
the United States is more pleasantly situated than this,''
Washington wrote in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists today see an estate that is much the same as in

 &HT;    HOW I SPENT MY BALTIC VACATION: Just look at those Latvian Alps
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What I didn't know about the Baltics until I got here:
</P>
<P>
   _ Latvia somehow has become known as the Switzerland of the
Baltics. Never mind that one-tenth of the country is below sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reassuring item from a tourist magazine: ``Chances are you
won't die on the spot if you drink water straight from the tap.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Popcorn comes flavored with your choice of either salt or
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   _ The farther south you go, from Estonia to Latvia to Lithuania,
the more picturesque the Baltics become. The farther north you go,
from Lithuania to Latvia to Estonia, the more prosperous the
Baltics become.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lithuanian cafes serve fried pig ears that are the size of a
platter.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, cabdrivers have to pay
kickbacks to crime organizations for the privilege of parking in
prime business areas, such as the train station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family tradition is strong in the Baltics, as illustrated by
the lyrics of this love song: ``I need just you ...'' the woman
sings to her man. She pauses and then adds, ``... and my daughter
and my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The gender symbols on restroom doors can be confusing for U.S.
visitors. A circle above a triangle is for women; a circle above an
inverted triangle is for men. The idea is this: Women are larger at
the bottom, men are larger at the top.
</P>
<P>
   _ The languages of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians have this
much in common: Each is well colored with Russian curse words.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new Robin Hood television series for the U.S. was filmed
this summer in the forests of Lithuania. It's a matter of
economics: Extras can be hired for $11 a day, and with bright
sunlight from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m., the workday is 12 hours long.
</P>
<P>
   _ But in winter, anyone working 8-5 in an office never sees the
sun. It rises at 9 a.m. and sets at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ People from Finland come here to drink. Their own country has
stringent liquor laws, the Baltics do not.
</P>
<P>
   _ A welcome sign for a homesick American at an Estonia hotel:
``Rotary International Meets Here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Latvia wants to ban the display of Nazi and Communist symbols,
such are the strong feelings that still exist in the Baltics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vilnius has a statue of Frank Zappa, the late American
rock-'n'-roll legend who enjoys cult status in the Baltics, thanks
to his anti-establishment lyrics, which were considered
anti-Communist as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ An American tourist tells this story as an example of how
little the U.S. knows about the Baltics: When he asked at an
America Express office in New York City to exchange dollars for
Latvian currency, he was told they had never heard of the place.
``Latvia?'' he was asked. ``Where's that _ in Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   _ You can learn more about the Baltics by checking the web site
maintained by ``City Paper _ The Baltic States,'' an excellent
English-language magazine, http://www.balticsww.com/.

EVEN PRIVATELY OWNED FORESTS NEED FEDERAL OVERSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-thirds of America's forest lands are owned by local, state
or private entities. Recently, the well-respected National Research
Council released a report calling for a national policy to help
maintain these important non-federal forest lands. The report hit
the hot button for Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and he has called for
its total rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Young is overreacting to this thrust for forest
conservation. He receives a large chunk of his campaign
contributions from the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is an independent body that was
organized by the National Academy of Sciences back in 1916 _ during
World War I _ to promote the national security and welfare of the
nation using scientific and technological expertise. The council is
administered by the National Academy of Sciences, the National
Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 council report, ``Forested Landscapes in Perspective:
Prospects and Opportunities for Sustainable Management of America's
Nonfederal Forests'' took two years to research and write and makes
a number of recommendations to ensure the long-term health of these
forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recommendations encroach upon private ownership _
causing Young to see red. He sent letters to 300 timber industry
executives alerting them to the report, and included his staff's
unfavorable analysis of it.
</P>
<P>
   Young's Aug. 11 letter overstates the report's conclusions:
``Basically, their (the report's authors) argument is that in the
name of `public interest' the federal government can do with your
private land as it pleases.'' Young uses his letter to urge timber
companies to politically support greater logging on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   He's lobbying the timber industrys' lobbyists to support him in
his battle with the Clinton administration and against the new
direction taken by the U.S. Forest Service that no longer makes
logging a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC report suggests the following key recommendations for
the federal government:
</P>
<P>
   _Strengthen programs that monitor non-federal forest health.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide greater assistance to states for wild-fire suppression
and fuel management technologies.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish a national policy for non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Identify national interests in non-federal forests and create a
strategic plan for federal action.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish partnerships with private forest landowners.
</P>
<P>
   _Create educational programs focused on non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Using fiscal and tax incentives, coordinate regulatory and
technical assistance programs for landowners with large tracts of
forest.
</P>
<P>
   _Use fiscal incentives and technical assistance to promote
sustainable non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Design regulatory programs that reflect public and private
rights, responsibilities and interests in maintaining healthy
private forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   The report's regulatory language dropped like a brick on Young's
knee, his leg kicked out: ``Imagine,'' he wrote in his letter to
timber industry executives, ``the red tape of a coercive federal
regulatory scheme being applied to your private property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the nation needs to promote
sustainability in all forest lands. Our wildlife and watersheds
need protection on these 490 million acres of state and private
forest lands. Nearly 90 percent of threatened or endangered species
have habitat in these forests.
</P>
<P>
   If long-term forest health can be accomplished through
education, technical assistance and tax incentives _ without the
heavy hand of federal regulation _ the nation is richer _ including
the private forest owners.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and fiscal incentives can entice private owners to entered
into agreements with the federal government to use good management
practices in their forests. If these incentives are successful, the
short-term profit gained by clearcutting large tracts of land
gradually will be replaced by long-term goals that sustain profits
over decades and sustain healthy forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   A person who owns a house in a community does not have the right
to burn it down. Private ownership is not the issue _ public safety
is. The forests can be looked at the same way. Privately owned
forests are part of the larger forest ecology. Destructive forest
management practices put the nation at risk _ through soil erosion,
endangering water quality, destruction of watersheds and
elimination of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Young could take a leadership role on this issue by accepting
and promoting some of the report's better recommendations and
criticizing those that would take an ax to private ownership.

 &HT;    Flex your mental muscle
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The threat of going mad _ losing his mental capacity _ plagued
Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson during
almost seven years in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spent 2,455 days isolated from the world after Muslim
extremists abducted him in Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson knew instinctively what doctors swear by today: You
can combat mental decline by keeping your mind occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson goaded fellow hostages into heated debates, badgered
one into teaching him a foreign language and created his own form
of sign language and tapping noises to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying and learning new things are effective ways of keeping
your processes fresh and active,'' says Dr. Larry Eisner, medical
director of the Baumel-Eisner Neuromedical Institute in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us (after school) stop learning things on a routine
basis. If we stop learning, we stop remembering how to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do we continue that learning process?
</P>
<P>
   Reading and casual conversation are good, but ``minor'' ways of
challenging the brain, Eisner says.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to exercise your mental capabilities, take
courses, learn a new hobby or skill or participate in lectures or
``serious'' discussion groups. Doing puzzles, crosswords or playing
games that involve memory will also help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps the brain in an active mode and doesn't allow it to
deteriorate based on disuse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is the level of activity. Watching television _
even the History Channel _ is more passive than getting into a
rip-roaring debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need activities in an interactive fashion to engage your
intelligence,'' explains Dr. Rodrigo Kuljis, professor of neurology
and psychiatry at the University of Miami Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend weeks on end watching TV passively, you probably
won't do well. But people who pursue interests that are
intellectually challenging tend to preserve their intellectual
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And we can hone the sharpness of our minds well into old age.
Contrary to what was once thought, senility is not inevitable as
times passes. Twenty percent of mature adults experience no
discernible drop in their mental faculties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people in their 90s who are remarkably sharp,'' Kuljis
says. ``And that's the reason we don't accept even subtle
complaints that (mental decline) is due to aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tend to fall back into things that are
entertaining. You need things that require your participation, that
challenge you without being overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of memory, each influenced differently by
age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor of neurology at
Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
</P>
<P>
   Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Physical exercise is important to keeping the mind alert, also.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is an organ _ a functioning, living, breathing organ
_ and we want to maintain the blood flow and the connections
between nerve cells on a sound basis. We can keep them healthy and
operating at peak performance by being active and regularly
stimulated,'' Eisner adds.
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first. If needed, your
doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a complete
evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal interview
and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive skills,
including concentration and orientation.

 &HT;    Sales-oriented CEO energizes Equifax
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot has changed since Thomas F. Chapman ran into a brick wall
when he went looking for help from Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chapman was at First National Bank of Atlanta, and
his ``passion was to sell a lot of stuff.'' He asked Equifax if
there was a way to cross-check data for leads.
</P>
<P>
   The best Equifax could do then was to simply suggest it might
give the bank a discount on credit reports, Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Equifax offers the kind of information Chapman needed. And
Chapman is president _ since August 1997 _ and chief executive
officer _ since January _ of the Atlanta-based credit reporting and
information services company.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is Chapman the salesman, which is a plus
for Equifax, according to analyst Kevin R. Gruneich of Bear,
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is the right person to take (Equifax) forward,'' Gruneich
said. He has ``a sales orientation, and I think that is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great marketer,'' added John Rougeou, who retired as
executive vice president of Equifax's North American operations in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime Atlantans might recall the hoopla Chapman set off
in 1982 with a teaser promotion rate of 18.65 percent on money
market deposit accounts at First National.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his marketing program,'' said D. Raymond Riddle,
Chapman's boss at First National and a director of Equifax since
1989. ``It kind of shocked the banking community. It set off a
price war, but being first, the bank was able to capitalize and get
a nice deposit base.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman was one of the early outsiders that C.B. ``Jack'' Rogers
Jr., now chairman of Equifax, hired after he joined the company
from IBM. Chapman, who in 1988 left what was then Wachovia, was
hired by Rogers in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack felt he needed someone to energize Equifax,'' said
Riddle, a former chairman and chief executive of National Service
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   What he got was ``no shrinking violet,'' by Chapman's own
admission. ``Emotional'' is another way that Chapman describes
himself, as do others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sit back like a guy ats ... a funeral home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman can be animated, boisterous, funny and _ based on his
own telling and that of others _ demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He strives for perfection not only of others, but for
himself,'' Rougeou said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman recounted how he recently dropped a travel book on
someone's desk, with a note that he thought the recipient's little
girls would enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make me a good guy. It just means there is some
compassion there,'' Chapman said. ``And,'' he added in explanation
of the gift, ``a couple of weeks ago I near killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things I learned from Raymond Riddle (is)
that he had this great knack of not letting the day close, if you
sort of crossed horns with someone, without going and making it OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean `I forgive you for costing us $10 million.'
It's just, `You're OK with me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive's job is OK, too, even if there are
``moments,'' as Chapman said he told a group of Equifax employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This is not a very fun job sometimes. Every day you
have to be driven by the stock price, and things happen to your
market and you don't know why. You're supposed to have answers to
questions (and) sometimes there are no answers to them.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``So, by and large, this is a pretty difficult job. But I love
this job. It's a great job, but there are days when I'd love for
somebody else to have it.''

 &HT;    Equifax has expanded into global information service
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strategy for Equifax was set with the arrival in 1987 of
C.B. ``Jack'' Rogers Jr. as president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to use technology to transform Equifax's products
into more useful and valuable offerings.
</P>
<P>
   That's still the idea: selling information rather than raw data.
And it continues under Thomas F. Chapman, the current president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chapman took the company further along that route
with the acquisition of Decisioneering Group, a firm that brings a
new business _ customer loyalty consulting _ to Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to help companies find a way to develop customers
for life, as well as be more efficient in attracting those
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our customers say, `OK, how do we take this customer
and multiply the relationship in order to keep them?' It takes a
whole new set of tools,'' said Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a new set of tools is part of the acquisition strategy at
Equifax, which looks for companies that will bring it better
technology, new products, or geographic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Equifax announced its biggest deal since 1990, one
that gets it into the Brazilian market. For $200 million in cash,
Equifax bought 80 percent of Seguranca ao Credito e Informacoes,
which sells business and consumer credit information and other
data.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from a credit reporting company to what Equifax
is today has not gone unnoticed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Salomon Smith Barney started coverage of the
company with a ``buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equifax is best known as one of the three dominant providers
of consumer credit reports in the U.S. (with the others being
Experian and Trans Union), but we believe this description is too
narrow and that it misses key parts of (Equifax's) growth story,''
analysts at Salomon Smith Barney wrote. ``The company is actually a
diversified global information and payment services company with a
significant opportunity to expand both the services offered as well
as the geographic markets covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of Equifax stock is down since that report was issued,
but still faring better than the broader market. It closed Friday
at $37.37 1/2, down from a 52-week high of $44.12 1/2 hit Aug. 2,
but up 5.5 percent this year against a 0.36 percent gain for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.

 &HT;    Backup quarterbacks enter the spotlight
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything in life, it's said, so who are Matt Tittle,
Patrick Fletcher and Eric Crouch to disagree?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, who are they, period?
</P>
<P>
   Before the football season, they weren't exactly household
names, except perhaps in their own households. Before Saturday,
Sept. 5, they were seldom-used backup quarterbacks and, for two of
them, no change in that status seemed in imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nebraska's Crouch knew Sept. 5 would be a big day for him,
since he already had been pencil ed in to start for injured Bobby
Newcombe against Alabama-Birmingham. But it also turned into a big
day for Texas Tech's Tittle and Oklahoma's Fletcher as all three
played improbable roles in leading their teams to season-opening
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have to go with a backup quarterback, the
first game probably is the best time to do it before people get
into a flow as the season goes along,'' Baylor Coach Dave Roberts
said. ``But I don't know if there is a good time, really.''
</P>

   Tittle, a fifth-year senior who had played in a grand total of
two previous games at Tech, was thrust into the Raiders' game
against Texas-El Paso early in the second quarter when Rob Peters

 &HT;    When going gets tough, tough go shopping
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists are wondering whether the stock market's recent
gyrations will lead to a significant decline in consumer spending.
As a baby boomer, allow me to make this prediction: No.
</P>
<P>
   If our parents were still the dominant force in the economy, I
would be worried about a collapse in consumer spending. Americans
born in the 1920s and 1930s tend to be conservative with their
money because they lived through the Depression that followed the
1929 market crash. No matter how wealthy they grew in later years,
they never forgot the taste of those stale bread and ketchup
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   These early experiences shaped their attitudes about using
credit, hopping jobs and spending money. For the most part, they
became the coupon-clipping smart shoppers who paid off their
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   But their children were influenced by very different economic
forces. The 76 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 grew
up in a much more affluent time. Born into families that were
growing richer and better educated, they developed an upbeat
outlook about money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the affluence of the 1960s wasn't the primary influence
on boomers' financial habits. In fact, it was the wild inflation of
the next decade that made them eager to borrow and spend freely.
</P>
<P>
   If you bought your first house in 1978, your parents might have
been worried about the inflated price and outrageous mortgage rate.
Yet it turned out you were wise to buy because housing priceght
stock on margin, they positioned themselves to reap gains in the
great bull market. When they hopped from one job to the next, they
typically ended up getting raises.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bulk of boomers are in the heavy-spending decade of the
life cycle. Economists say our spending peak is reached at 46, an
age when money is flying out the door for mortgage payments, cars,
teenagers' clothes, tuition, furnishings and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   This is very good news for the world. Why? Because the primary
economic problem today is overcapacity. Too many factories are
making too many cars, clothes, toys and other products. To keep the
global economy from falling into a depression, somebody has to keep
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now that's a job for my generation. Unlike our parents, who
might take the recent turbulence in financial markets as a signal
to reduce spending, we are searching for bargains in the stock
market and good deals on bigger cars.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Federal Reserve Board pushes down interest rates,
we'll get home-equity loans to spruce up our houses. When 30-year
mortgage rates slip to 6 percent, we'll call the Realtor and start
shopping for a bigger place. And we'll continue working long hours
so we can keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Our motto has always been, ``When the going gets tough, the
tough go shopping.'' Now the world can count on us to do what we do
best: spend.

 &HT;    Experimental care not covered, insurer said
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jupiter resident Lise Greene's fight with her HMO is nothing
unusual in the insurance world.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is a judge forced her managed-care insurance
company, Well Care HMO, to pay for her hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for bladder damage. Well Care argued that the procedure is
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only known injunction of its kind in Florida, and it
could lead to more people seeking similar judgments in the future,
say Greene's lawyer, Gary M. Farmer Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, and a
lawyer who specializes in health-care law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for patients. . . . It's not so good for
HMOs,'' said Jeff Cohen, a Delray Beach lawyer and former chairman
of managed-care law for the Florida Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's problems began in March 1997 when she was diagnosed
with uterine cancer. The radiation treatment damaged her bladder,
and by Christmas she developed persistent hemorrhagic cystitis,
which results in bleeding and the inability to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a car ride and having to really go to the bathroom and
magnify that 10 or 20 times,'' Farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO said it would pay for a treatment that required Greene
to have surgery so she could again go to the bathroom. Using this
treatment, she said her doctors told her, eventually her bladder
would shrink to nothing. From March to June this year, Greene had
six surgeries costing from about $12,000 to $32,000. The total bill
far exceeds the cost of the hyperbaric oxygen treatment Greene's
doctors had recommended. They estimate she will need about 40
treatments at a cost of $1,100 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting really because we had a solution to
everything,'' Greene says. ``We would not have had to go through
all this (surgery), and they would have saved a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said maybe Well Care didn't want to pay for Greene's
hyperbaric treatment because then it would have to pay for it in
other cases where alternative treatments might cost less. In court
documents Well Care's attorney, Thomas S. Rutherford of Tampa,
pointed out Well Care was willing to pay for all Greene's other
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbaric oxygen chamber is commonly known for treating the
bends in scuba divers. However, it is used for everything from
healing wounds to radiation damage in the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how it heals is not known, but anecdotal evidence is it
works, says Dr. Roy Duke, one of three doctors who work with the
chambers at St. Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene enters a chamber at St. Mary's, a hood is placed on
her, and she breathes 100 percent oxygen while the air in the
chamber is as if she were about 40 feet below sea level, forcing
more oxygen into her system. At intervals, the hood is taken off so
the patient can take a break, Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care argued that it didn't have to pay for the hyperbaric
treatments because they were considered experimental and thus not
covered under Greene's insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer argued that the treatments for Greene's condition
have been effectively used since the early 1980s and couldn't be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's arguments prevailed with Circuit Judge Edward Fine, who
granted a preliminary injunction forcing Well Care to pay for the
treatments while the company appealed the decision. Greene posted a
$1,000 bond in case she lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that plaintiff has shown a substantial
likelihood that she will prevail on the merits of her claim for
health insurance coverage,'' Fine wrote in his July 2 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are forced to pay for their treatment while
they appeal HMO decisions. They usually only sue after the fact for
repayment. But Greene could not even do that, Farmer said. Even
though Greene said she would pay for the treatments herself, the
hospital wanted proof of insurance coverage because the treatments
are so expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care appealed, but has since withdrawn the appeal, Farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put my client through six months of entirely unnecessary
physical suffering and mental strain,'' he said.

   There are eight wee flaps with directions such as ``try this,''
``touch this powder'' and ``burst this blob.'' Think pop-up book.

   ``Readers are telling us that they're trying makeup they never
would've tried,'' says Allure Editor in Chief Linda Wells. ``And
not to sound touchy-feely, but this brings back the playfulness of

</P>
<P>
   There is a science _ plus an astronomical production cost _ to
slathering goo behind a trap door on glossy paper that's reproduced
800,000 times. But the technology, developed by Arcade (the company
that created perfume ScentStrips), is top-secret. And so is the
bill, which was paid by Allure, not by companies whose items are
featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a panel sample lots of products and pick the best ones
like we always do,'' Wells says. ``We wanted to be sure the story
didn't look like an ad, so we didn't design the samples to look
like a lipstick tube or blush compact.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you're shown a model's made-up face and given
instructions: ``For this look, try lipstick 1 and eye shadow 6.''
</P>
<P>
   The best news is, if Chanel's Nightlight Bronze shadow makes you
look like Frankenstein's betrothed, you're not out $25.
</P>
<P>
   Just $2.50, horoscope included.

 &HT;    Hacking was inside job to promote MTV awards
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MTV's Web site seems a prime candidate for teenage hackers who
like to mess with big-time sites. For a while last week, it looked
as if MTV had indeed been hacked. As it turns out, the defaced
start page was actually created by MTV itself as a promotion for
Thursday's ``MTV Video Music Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Silicon Alley Reporter's editor, Jason McCabe Calacanis,
extracted a gleeful confession from MTV Tuesday, designers and
programmers who flood the mailing list of the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium were divided on the possibility the MTV site
could be hacked.
</P>
<P>
   In place of MTV's slick black Web pages was a bright yellow
message reading ``I'm in! I TOLD YOU GUYS I'D DO IT! Shoutouts to
milw0rm, vaporRub and Dave D. in Secacus! By the way, I've got
something serious planned for this Wednesday, so you better come
by. J.F.'' There was also faux spray paint across the MTV logo with
the words ``J.F. was here.'' (For those of you who missed it, the
altered home page is preserved at (http://www.nocturna.com
</P>
<P>
   /hacked.html).
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, real hacking involves gaining illegal
access to a site's server and altering the code that makes the site
look the way it does. The designers and programmers on the WWWAC
list were nostalgically hoping it was a couple of kids from New
Jersey busting into the site, but most suspected MTV was behind the
hack. And if MTV was trying to sell something, they said, this was
a lame way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   MTV spokeswoman Caroline Mockridge said the J.F. stands for
Johnny Fame, a new MTV personality who will be covering the MTV
awards exclusively online. ``We wanted to present this personality
to our audience in a dramatic and media-appropriate way,'' she
said. ``You'll be surprised how his presence will manifest itself
between now and the awards show.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most jaded Web denizen has to admit it's pretty clever
to make your own Web site look as if it had been hacked to generate
a buzz among your target audience _ high school and college kids
who routinely surf the Web, and the aging artsy/hipster types who
still watch MTV and frequent Internet mailing lists where
journalists tend to troll for information. As Magnavox used to say
in its TV ads, ``Smart. Very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Net regulars did not believe the site had actually been
hacked. It's fairly easy to see why. Back in the dark ages of the
Internet _ about four or five years ago _ ``hacking'' or illegally
breaking into a Web site was something of a hobby. The fabled two
kids in a garage so integral to mythology of the Internet would
spend endless hours surrounded by computers, monitors and a pile of
blue, black, green and gray ``hacker'' boxes. Eventually, they'd
find their way into a site or a database and change billing records
or grade reports, look for stored credit card numbers or maybe
alter a few pages of text. Like graffiti artists, hackers had their
own ``signatures,'' as many on the WWWAC list pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, we live in an age of browsers that provide
encryption standards so powerful that users must verify the fact
they are U.S. citizens before even downloading either the Netscape
or Microsoft browser. With the recent boomlet in electronic
commerce, sites such as ESPN SportZone (which was hacked by an
employee last summer trying to prove how shoddy SportsZone's
security was) have more elaborate gatekeeping devices to keep
information from being hacked by outsiders than ever before. Online
banking services such as First Union won't even deliver banking
information unless its customers have the strongest encryption
technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites must now go to great pains to prove their sites are
more secure than Fort Knox. A couple of kids from Secaucus, N.J.,
breaking into the MTV server and redesigning a couple of pages
would be a good laugh at corporate America's expense. But in the
new age of encryption, hacking a major Web site would have to be an
inside job _ just like the one at MTV.

   In this age of the Internet and 24-hour news television, anyone
can become a celebrity overnight. Which also means you can just as
quickly become a target for public scrutiny. ``Spin,'' a new book
by spin doctor Michael S. Sitrick and journalist Allan Mayer, talks
about this modern phenomenon and how you can make it work for you.
Among the famous cases Sitrick was involved in were the bankruptcy
of Orange County, Calif., and Food Lion's suit against ABC News.

   Interactive Magic is offering a new wrinkle in the growing list
of flight simulators. Called ``Carrier Strike Fighter,'' this game
lets you land and take off on a U.S. aircraft carrier. The game is
modeled on real aircraft carriers. It also includes video and sound
effects from the USS Abraham Lincoln. ``Carrier Strike'' retails
for about $40 and is available only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   First it was deer. Now its waterfowl and big game. The success
of WizardWorks' original ``Deer Hunter'' has prompted the company
to release a series of add-on games. Two of the latest are ``Bird
Hunter'' and ``Trophy Hunter.'' You need the original game to play
these new scenarios. The add-ons work only with Windows 95 or
higher PC operating systems. They retail for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   With summer ending, golfers eventually will be moving inside.
But that's no excuse to give up following the game. Now you can do
it on the Internet. There are plenty of sites, and one of the best
is maintained by Links magazine. This site offers a look at some of
the best and most famous courses in the world. There's also a look
at the game's big personalities. You'll find the site at
http://www.linksmagazine.com.

 &HT;    Hand-held phones enter another era
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hand-held cellular phones have taken another leap forward in the
arena of personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   Audiovox has unveiled the FoneFinder, a hand-held that can be
vehicle-mounted and has a Global Positioning Satellite receiver
built in to pinpoint the location of 911 callers. With a touch of
the large 911 button on the top of the phone, the phone and its GPS
receiver are turned on. A built-in speech chip announces the
caller's location to emergency dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   With GPS and the speech chip, even an injured caller who can't
speak or someone who doesn't know exactly where he is can get help
fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 million cellular 911 calls made in a
year, but locating the caller has been a problem in the past. In
one case in South Dakota, it took three days to find a woman
stranded in a snowbank. She finally was spotted from the air.
</P>
<P>
   FoneFinder works with existing cellular infrastructure, so the
system should be both inexpensive and immediately deployable.
Commercial versions of the phone, which was demonstrated for the
first time at a conference in San Francisco on Aug. 26, will be
available in November. List price is $399.
</P>
<P>
   FoneFinder was developed by Tendler Cellular of Boston, which
joined with OKI Semiconductor of Sunnyvale, Calif., to provide the
speech component.
</P>
<P>
   All for one; one for all
</P>
<P>
   Folks who run a business out of their homes are always looking
for ways to be more efficient while saving a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. is trying to help with a new offering
that combines more functions than some Swiss army knives do.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's six-in-one UX-2700CM combines plain paper fax, 600 dpi
color printer, color scanner, color copier, PC fax and phone into a
compact unit just 10 1/2 inches wide, 15 1/4 inches deep and 8 1/2
inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The UX also sports an infrared data port, allowing users to
print wirelessly from a notebook PC or other hand-held device with
infrared capability.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated retail price is $500. If that's too much, an
identical machine without the color capability, the UX-2200CM, is
available for $400. Both prices are about half what it would cost
to get each of the components separately.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are compatible with Windows 3.1, 95 and 98. Sharp
does not plan to offer a Macintosh version because of interface
difficulties, Sharp spokeswoman Lois Catala said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate reality
</P>
<P>
   The concept of equal pay for equal work hasn't turned into
reality for many of the nation's millions of working women.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can find out how much the pay gap is costing them at a
new Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .aflcio.org/women/equalpay.htm) launched by the AFL-CIO.
Visitors can enter salary, age and education to find out what's
what. For example, an average 29-year-old woman with a college
degree will lose $990,000 to the gap over her career, according to
the labor group's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The site breaks down the wage gap by profession and state, and
includes a list of actions women can take to fight for equal pay in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes have it
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's classic novel ``1984'' painted a stark picture
of a world in which war was peace and Big Brother watched every
move.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother would have loved the advances in workplace software.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently reported on a new generation of
software that lets managers record virtually every keystroke an
employee makes _ without the worker knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   In August, software maker WinWhatWhere Corp. of Kennewick,
Wash., released Investigator, a program that records every
keystroke, command and mouse click entered on a PC. The program
costs $285 per computer, but the company will cut a deal for larger
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tech Assist of Largo, Fla., began distributing Desktop
Surveillance, made by Omniquad in the United Kingdom. Desktop
Surveillance runs about $55 for each copy. The software can
automatically generate a log and e-mail it to a supervisor without
the employee's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms said they responded to a pent-up demand from
employers worried about workers wasting time on company PCs.
</P>
<P>
   WinWhatWhere President Richard Eaton told the Times there was
some soul-searching at his company about whether to produce the
software. ``It just seemed like too much, but it was the No. 1
request from our customers,'' Eaton said.

 &HT;    IBM ViaVoice Gold doesn't sparkle enough
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing our small exploration of voice recognition programs,
we'll take a look today at IBM ViaVoice Gold, a program that has a
few startling similarities to Voice Xpress Plus but in general is a
quite different program.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are really all in the setup routines. The user
is provided with a microphone nearly identical to that which comes
with the L&AMP;H program, and each user must also ``enroll'' by
uttering a lot of phrases into the mike to help the program sort
out voice differences.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are in the application of the two programs.
Voice Xpress Plus is pretty much a one-trick pony; it is tied to
Microsoft Word, or its own little word processor, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ViaVoice, on the other hand, can be used to some degree with
nearly anything. It's very slick at running Windows 95. Looking at
the desktop, for instance, you can say ``open calculator'' and just
like magic, up pops the calculator. You can then run the calculator
simply by saying something like ``seven plus 16 minus five
equals,'' and there's your answer.
</P>
<P>
   It is linked directly, in terms of dictation, to Word, WordPad
and its own little version of WordPad called SpeakPad. It will deal
with many situations in other programs, though. After a certain
amount of fumbling around, I got a connection to the Internet
verbally. I could open Netscape with no trouble, but it wouldn't
start Eudora Pro. However, once Eudora was open, I could minimize
and then maximize it.
</P>
<P>
   I seemed to have less trouble dictating through ViaVoice than
Voice Xpress, by which I mean that word recognition seemed more
accurate. It is a little slower at producing results than Voice
Xpress, which perhaps is a good thing. The instructions warn you
against getting overly concerned with the immediate results because
ViaVoice has a logic based on usage. I noticed several times that
it came up with something preposterous but soon changed it based on
subsequent dictation.
</P>
<P>
   However, presumably because it attempts to cover much more
ground, ViaVoice is more difficult to use than Voice Xpress.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Xpress is much slicker at operating Word in general. As I
remarked last week, it is remarkably accurate at discerning what
words you wish it to write down, and what words are program
commands. It is all very fluid when it works right _ which means,
essentially, when it understands what you're saying.
</P>
<P>
   ViaVoice, on the other hand, requires that you turn off
dictating mode _ ``stop dictation'' _ before you begin issuing
editing commands. And while Voice Xpress was fairly loose about how
you phrase your editing commands, ViaVoice is pretty strict. On top
of that, fragmented instructions make it seem a lot harder to learn
than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   To make either of these programs truly useful for extensive
dictation, they would have to work a whole lot better than they did
for me. Whether further enrolling would make them work better I
cannot say. It is interesting to note that while I got fewer
initial errors with ViaVoice, the errors I did get seemed to be
virtually uncorrectable.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of voice recognition, those of you
concerned about the security of your files might wish to look at a
new program from Veritel Corp. called Voicecrypt. Anyone attempting
to access files protected with Voicecrypt must then not only know
the password, but say it in your voice or they're locked out.

 &HT;    Don't blame the Internet for the failings of humanity
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in technology this past week came from Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where researchers discovered that
people who spent hours and hours on the Internet each night didn't
have time left to have any real human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, these cyber-junkies spent a lot of time
being depressed.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise that was. It is roughly equivalent to
discovering that people who walk in the rain get wet and then long
to be dry.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have the research subjects, a hundred or so people in
Pittsburgh who _ instead of taking walks and hugging _ sit in front
of a computer monitor all night. And lo and behold, they have lousy
personal lives, lose touch with their families and feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes researchers at fancy universities are so danged smart
they overlook the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   I think those Ph.D.s confused a symptom for the disease. Imagine
what they would have found if they surveyed people who spent almost
all their spare time playing golf, or dancing or watching TV. Do
you think their personal relationships would be any better? Would
the day magically have more hours in it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm the last person in the world to defend the sort of shallow
relationships spawned in the Internet's chat groups. I'd much
rather talk to someone I can see. And my guess is that most of the
friendships and the romances that develop there have the life span
of a fly. But I also think it is likely the same people would find
shallow and short-lived relationships in the real world. I'm saying
that it's not the Internet's doing; it's the people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some of these people with friendships and romances that
exist only in cyberspace are doing the best they can. People who
are shy or socially inept in real life sometimes become bold and
witty in the pretend world of the chat groups. My guess is that
many of them wouldn't have any relationships at all if not for the
Internet. I'm thinking that any human contact _ no matter how
flawed _ is better than none at all. So it's hard to judge.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising about the fact new technology is seen
as magical, with exaggerated notions of how good it is or how evil
it is. That's a human reaction that dates all the way back to
primitive man. In the very earliest days, even fire was seen as a
spirit. When the first cameras came along, people were afraid the
images they took would capture our souls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golden Age of Television, some social critics saw it as a
demonic force that would destroy civilization; others thought it
would automatically change tastes and make opera and theater lovers
out of the masses. Civilization may be a little battered, but it's
still around. And instead of being a nation of theater lovers, we
watch MTV.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange how little the human thinking process has changed.
We use different words and terms than medieval people, but we still
think new technology has magical powers. Instead of seeing the
Internet as the particularly complex and efficient delivery system
for data that it is _ a neutral pipeline that doesn't care what it
carries _ we believe the pipeline itself has a personality of its
own and powers far beyond what you'd expect from a bunch of wires
and fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, I think people should worry more about
spending time with those they love than in trying to find witches
hiding in the Internet. It's a lot easier to blame technology than
ourselves for our failings. But when we do that, the problem
becomes unsolvable. We can't fix the technology; we can only fix
ourselves. Either that or move out of Pittsburgh.

 &HT;    Flex your mental muscle
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The threat of going mad _ losing his mental capacity _ plagued
Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson during
almost seven years in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spent 2,455 days isolated from the world after Muslim
extremists abducted him in Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson knew instinctively what doctors swear by today: You
can combat mental decline by keeping your mind occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson goaded fellow hostages into heated debates, badgered
one into teaching him a foreign language and created his own form
of sign language and tapping noises to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying and learning new things are effective ways of keeping
your processes fresh and active,'' says Dr. Larry Eisner, medical
director of the Baumel-Eisner Neuromedical Institute in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us (after school) stop learning things on a routine
basis. If we stop learning, we stop remembering how to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do we continue that learning process?
</P>
<P>
   Reading and casual conversation are good, but ``minor'' ways of
challenging the brain, Eisner says.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to exercise your mental capabilities, take
courses, learn a new hobby or skill or participate in lectures or
``serious'' discussion groups. Doing puzzles, crosswords or playing
games that involve memory will also help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps the brain in an active mode and doesn't allow it to
deteriorate based on disuse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is the level of activity. Watching television _
even the History Channel _ is more passive than getting into a
rip-roaring debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need activities in an interactive fashion to engage your
intelligence,'' explains Dr. Rodrigo Kuljis, professor of neurology
and psychiatry at the University of Miami Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend weeks on end watching TV passively, you probably
won't do well. But people who pursue interests that are
intellectually challenging tend to preserve their intellectual
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And we can hone the sharpness of our minds well into old age.
Contrary to what was once thought, senility is not inevitable as
times passes. Twenty percent of mature adults experience no
discernible drop in their mental faculties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people in their 90s who are remarkably sharp,'' Kuljis
says. ``And that's the reason we don't accept even subtle
complaints that (mental decline) is due to aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tend to fall back into things that are
entertaining. You need things that require your participation, that
challenge you without being overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of memory, each influenced differently by
age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor of neurology at
Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
</P>
<P>
   Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Physical exercise is important to keeping the mind alert, also.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is an organ _ a functioning, living, breathing organ
_ and we want to maintain the blood flow and the connections
between nerve cells on a sound basis. We can keep them healthy and
operating at peak performance by being active and regularly
stimulated,'' Eisner adds.
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first. If needed, your
doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a complete
evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal interview
and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive skills,
including concentration and orientation.

 &HT;    Where did I park the car?
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips on improving your recall ability:
</P>
<P>
   Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
</P>
<P>
   Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
</P>
<P>
   On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
</P>
<P>
   Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the car? Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.
</P>
<P>
   WAYS TO KEEP YOUR BRAIN SHARP
</P>
<P>
   _ Get plenty of sleep and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read books and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enroll in an adult education course.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn a new hobby or skill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attend lectures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Engage in debates; have serious conversations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do crossword puzzles; play word games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid passive activities like watching television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid substances known to damage the brain: alcohol, drugs,
tobacco, excess fatty foods and cholesterol.

 &HT;    'Cats of Lamu' is an informal study of an old culture
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The island of Lamu is off the coast of Kenya. The renowned
wildlife photographer Jack Couffer _ ``Born Free, Out of Africa'' _
discovered it more than 20 years ago, and has been going back ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cats of Lamu'' (Lyons Press, $24.95) is his fascinating,
semi-anthropological look at the indigenous population of the
island's semi-feral cats.
</P>
<P>
   Couffer initially became fascinated because the Lamu cats are
clearly genetic twins of the cats of ancient Egypt, which were
thought to have evolved out of existence _ skinny, fine-boned, with
very long tails. On balance, inherently aristocratic and quite
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamu cats live only about five years on the average, despite
the fact that the native population takes good care of them as a
sort of religious duty; Couffer's book features delightful pictures
of about 50 of the cats residing in a local school, where the
teacher dutifully feeds them, and the cats spend the day resting
among the children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cats are largely wild, some of them have a liking
for people and allow themselves to be petted, although their
generosity rarely extends so far as to be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Couffer's method is similar to Jane Goodall's; he separates the
population into prides, adopts several animals in each pride, names
them, then tracks them and becomes as intimate as possible with
them in order to discover their habits and traits. Along the way,
he becomes one with a remote culture.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a picture book _ although the photos are excellent;
not exactly scientifically painstaking _ Couffer is a good,
spritely writer _ ``The Cats of Lamu'' is like a cat: simply
itself, something to be cherished.
</P>
<P>
   THAR SHE BLOWS! . . . The success of ``The Perfect Storm'' has
publishers looking for other books to fill the same niche. Viking
has paid around $1 million for ``In the Heart of the Sea: The
Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,'' the story of a 19th-century
shipwreck brought on by one very hostile sperm whale. It's the
story that inspired Melville to write ``Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Nathaniel Philbrick told ``Perfect Storm'' author
Sebastian Junger about his book when Junger spoke at Philbrick's
Marine Institute in Nantucket. Junger clued in his agent, and
voila!
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's saying whether Junger gets a piece of Philbrick's
action for being a good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   GREAT FIRST PARAGRAPHS. . . ``It was almost quitting time when
Toddy met the man with no chin and the talking dog. Almost three in
the afternoon.'' _ from Jim Thompson's ``The Golden Gizmo,''
published by Vintage
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE . . . ``To love another: the riskiest, most
profound choice . . . obviously the ground of all real ethics, the
most terrifying, the one that demands the most commitment and
energy, the most potentially annihilating, the most demanding of
both identity and non-identity.'' _ C.K. Williams

 &HT;    With a single squeak
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many good reasons behind my return to the workforce
fulltime, but I didn't note one of the best until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are back in school, and one is taking band for the
first time. Last spring, when we discussed which instrument he
should choose, the clarinet seemed a natural. For one thing, it
would be easy to carry to school, unlike a tuba or baritone. Also,
my husband was an ace clarinetist during his high school days, and
he could give some expert pointers to our son.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, as we made our decision, swinging melodies from the
likes of Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman danced in my head.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, I visited with a friend who is a band instructor at
a local school and told him of our son's instrument choice. He took
me aside and looked solemnly into my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A word of advice: Lay in a supply of earplugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it can't be that bad,'' I laughed merrily, remembering our
sons' first days on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me try to describe what your son's clarinet will sound
like in those first weeks,'' he continued. ``Think of a cat being
sucked through the engine of a jet airplane. That's close.''
</P>
<P>
   I swallowed hard.
</P>
<P>
   The first day our son came home with his instrument is forever
etched in my memory. His father and I were thrilled at his
excitement as he took the clarinet out of its case. We oohed and
aahed as he showed us how to assemble it and moisten the reed. We
admired his music stand and beginner's book.
</P>
<P>
   And then he blew.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, I had a flashback to the sounds I emitted in the
final throes of childbirth. My husband's eyes rolled up into his
head in painful recollection. In fact, I'm not sure there are words
in the English language to describe the sound that emanated from
the end of that harmless-looking instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Our dogs bolted from their slumber. There was howling and
quivering and ducking under the furniture. Actually, that was us,
not the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Another son came running from his bedroom in great
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that? Is everyone all right?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I looked at each other and then at our budding
musician, who stood there proudly, cheeks puffed wide, still
blowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my!'' I exclaimed. ``What sound you're getting!''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers know how to say volumes without hurting tender feelings.
My husband even took a turn, and after a 25-year layoff, was able
to coax a few high C's from the clarinet while our son watched in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long 30 minutes of practice, but I'm proud to say we
sat stoically through it. We encouraged our son every time he
stopped to catch his breath, opportunities we hastily took to
engage him in long periods of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   My ears rang for days, but it only took me a few moments to plan
my next step.
</P>
<P>
   When my son finished his practice that first day, I sat him down
and gave him an earnest talk about the importance of daily
practice. We discussed the need to set up a routine and stick to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I want you to do,'' I told him. ``When you get
home from school each day, take 30 minutes to relax and have a
snack. Then, immediately practice your clarinet. You can do any
other homework later, but always practice your clarinet first.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure, I call home before I leave the office. I
think he can squeak by without me on this one.

 &HT;    `I don't care' what they say; don't call me
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other day between 3 and 5 p.m., the phone in my kitchen rang
seven times and in those hours, that special time of day when
homework and hunger make young children insane, I _ woman _ was
able to accomplish many things.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard me roar.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what I did was this: Refuse the following, politely.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum siding on our stucco house, new exterior paint,
refinancing, carpet cleaning and another refinancing.
</P>
<P>
   I also listened to a computerized political advertisement for a
school board candidate who would go on to lose, and took a moment
of personal time _ excuse me for being so greedy _ to call my
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, please,'' I said. ``Can you pick up a pizza for dinner?
I'm too busy answering the telephone to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this might not annoy you. Indeed, you might not even be
home at these hours. But I have to tell you, this telephone
solicitation business has gotten out of hand. Indeed, everything to
do with the telephone is out of control, including last week's
decision by Florida utility officials that some guy from Texas can
name his phone company ``I Don't Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I like the telephone. I like to pick it up
and call my friend in Colorado and my mother in Ohio and my sister
on the other coast of Florida. I like a clear line with no crackle.
I like a bill under $150.
</P>
<P>
   But I do not appreciate it when the phone company puts little
voices in my head, the likes of which I heard just the other day
when I placed a called - between solicitations - to area code 303.
</P>
<P>
   It is 4:22 p.m. in the time zone you are calling, the chipper
voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, gee, thanks. But I think I can figure out what time it is
in Denver without the help of my long distance provider.
</P>
<P>
   These phone company people have tried to dupe me in other ways,
too, but I can be a strong, cautious sort. In fact, I am proud to
announce right here and now that I have never, ever, paid the
telephone company 50 cents to automatically dial a number I got
from a 411 operator, although I've considered it a few thousands
times.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I am sure that one day _ weak, hormonal and insane from
the constant ringing of the kitchen telephone _ I'll probably cave
in on that one too. Damn them.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to today's gripe, mainly, the fine folks at the
Florida Public Service Commission. See, they told Dennis Dees,
founder of KTNT (say it out loud. Sound anything like AT&AMP;T to you?)
that he can name his telephone companies ``I Don't Care'' and ``It
Doesn't Matter.'' Believe me, I am not some crazed carpet cleaner
making all this up.
</P>
<P>
   From what I'm told, this means if someone calls and asks which
phone company I want to do business with and I say, ``I Don't
Care,'' I'll soon be getting a bill from Mr. KTNT in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about somebody missing the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Because if those aluminum siding guys were really on the ball,
they'd go ahead and name their company ``Don't you dare call me
between 3 and 5 again.'' In fact, I just might be on to something.

 &HT;    How to pledge a sorority
 &HT;    Sidebar to SORORITY-SECRETS
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring, senior year of high school
</P>
<P>
   Girls who have been admitted to the University of Florida
receive a brochure describing the sorority selection process, which
takes place during ``Rush Week.'' ``A sorority is more than just a
chapter or a house,'' the brochure says. ``It is lifelong friends
who will be there to laugh, cry, celebrate and graduate with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer
</P>
<P>
   Girls who are interested register for Rush Week, sending UF's
Panhellenic Council 18 copies of their registration and $45. The
money is nonrefundable.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 16
</P>
<P>
   Rush Week officially begins with a mandatory Rushee Forum in the
university auditorium. The ``rushees'' receive identical white
T-shirts to wear for Round One.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17-18
</P>
<P>
   Round One: Rushees split into 16 groups of about 80 people, led
by rush counselors. (The counselors are sorority members who cannot
reveal which sorority they belong to until the week is over. They
wear orange pith helmets to stand out.) The groups visit eight
sorority houses a day for parties that last 30 minutes each. This
is for getting-to-know-you chatting, but attendance is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 19
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Preference: Each rushee chooses up to 10 favorite
sororities, while each sorority chooses who it will invite to the
second round of parties. (Each sorority has a certain number of
openings to fill, depending on how many members left the year
before.) Even if a girl lists a sorority as her favorite, she
cannot attend its party if she is not invited. If a girl doesn't
get any invitations, a rush counselor calls and tells her not to
show up any more. This year, only one girl had to be called.
Another 55 girls dropped out voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 19-20
</P>
<P>
   Round Two, the ``philanthropy round'': The rushees attend five
40-minute parties each day. Those who aren't invited to a party
wait together in the ``rushee lounge'' in a nearby auditorium. In
these parties, the rushees make items _ centerpieces, IV bag covers
_ that can be donated to community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 21
</P>
<P>
   Round Three, the ``video round'': Each rushee chooses her top
six sororities while each sorority prepares invitations. Four girls
were called to be told they had no invitations. Another 113 dropped
voluntarily. The rushees attend six 40-minute parties in the
afternoon. In these parties, the sororities show videos of their
activities and explain their meaning of sisterhood.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 22
</P>
<P>
   Final Preference: Each rushee picks her top three sorority
choices while sororities prepare invitations. The rushees attend
three 50-minute parties in the evening. Dress is formal or
semi-formal. Each rushee again ranks her three favorites.
Meanwhile, each sorority prepares three lists of girls they want to
invite. That night, a computer program matches the remaining girls
to sororities, according to the rankings. This year, 928 remained.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 23
</P>
<P>
   Bid Day: Rush counselors call girls who were not invited by a
sorority and tell them not to come. The rest walk to a nearby
field, where each rushee is given an envelope with her invitation
inside. They open the envelopes all at once and run to their new
sorority sisters, who are waiting outside their sorority houses
with balloons and cheers. Rush counselors now can reveal which
sorority they are in.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 23-Oct. 31
</P>
<P>
   New Member Education Program: The new girls take part in all
sorority activities except chapter meetings. This is the time when
those who don't like it drop out. The rest pay their dues. (New
member and initiation fees are estimated at $275, dues are $135,
meals are $650 a semester and housing, which is optional, is $725.)
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 1
</P>
<P>
   Initiation. For sorority members only. The new girls go through
the sorority's rituals and take an oath. Some sororities teach the
secret words that have meaning only to sorority members. Some have
secret handshakes or secret knocks for entering sorority meetings.
The initiation can last from one to six hours.

 &HT;    What a rush!

 &HT;    Photos available

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ They are not supposed to touch the girls.
</P>
<P>
   They may greet them and take their bag and walk them into the
sorority house. They may get them a glass of water. They may chat.
But they may not hug or hold hands or do anything that would say,
``We want you, more than we want that girl next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they may not even say, ``We hope to see you again.'' It
is against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   They may say, ``We are so very happy you decided to come back.''
They may kneel in front of the sitting girls and talk to them, to
keep better eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   They may, later in the week, dim the lights and give the girls
ribbons or flowers or pearls to wish on _ a sorority tradition _
and silently hope that wish will be, ``Please let them choose me.''
</P>
<P>
   And they may sing, and wipe their eyes, and gather in the foyer
of the sorority house in white dresses and say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year that sororities across America open
their houses to strangers. They call it Rush Week. By the end of
that week, the strangers _ mostly freshmen _ are met, looked over,
sorted, chosen (or not chosen) and welcomed as sisters. During that
week, they are called rushees.
</P>
<P>
   A rushee's job is to go to parties. At the University of
Florida, that means as many as 35 in six days. Each lasts less than
an hour. If you want to be invited back to the next round of
parties, a good first impression is key. There is lots of smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UF had the largest sorority rush in the nation, with
976 girls making it through the week and into one of the 16
sororities affiliated with the National Panhellenic Conference.
(UF's four historically black sororities conduct their own rush.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's Rush Week started with 1,225 rushees. Some quit
along the way. Others were called after one of the four rounds of
parties and told not to come back, because no sorority had invited
them. Some received invitations to sororities, only they weren't
the right sororities, and they cried.
</P>
<P>
   Little things are stressful. ``You have girls who might trip
walking out of a sorority house and freak out,'' says Michelle
Peitz, a senior from Stuart who is president of Zeta Tau Alpha.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week, 928 girls made it through.
</P>
<P>
   The rushees stop chattering when the door to the Chi Omega house
opens. Along the street, doors are opening to the other sorority
houses. Each sorority president has a stopwatch, and they are
synchronized. One by one, rushees are escorted inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Chi Omega interior is pink. Pink carpeting in the main room,
pink walls. No chairs. Rushees and sorority girls stand in pairs.
The room is full of noise. ``What's your name?'' ``Where are you
from?'' Every few minutes, the pairs shift. ``Let me introduce you
to . . .'' It is like a dance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chi Omega girls are wearing white hose and pastel-colored,
floral dresses. ``Obviously, someone had to tell them to dress like
this,'' whispers Annie Grodin, an Orlando senior and president of
the UF Panhellenic Council. ``It will be a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   A violation for dressing alike? Less than a decade ago, dressing
alike was a plus. Even rushees wore nice dresses and hose all week.
Some girls were paying $300 for clothes alone, says Mike Farley,
assistant dean.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the National Panhellenic Conference said sororities
should quit the special outfits, catered meals and elaborate
``Broadway'' skits. A spending cap was suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying, get to know the women and quit entertaining,''
says Lissa Bradford, conference chair. ``The rush that had
developed in the '80s gave the public the impression that
sororities were very shallow _ just rah-rah songs and skits.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the University of Florida dropped skits and let
rushees wear casual clothes _ shirts and shorts _ for the first two
rounds of parties. It set a $3,500 spending cap for each sorority,
money that pays for balloons and finger foods and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   So Chi Omega might end up paying $100 to the Panhellenic Council
for dressing alike, Annie says. And they may have to have their
outfits screened before next year's rush.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations over, the Chi Omega girls move on to another new
Rush Week feature, the video. They stand in a semi-circle around
the seated rushees, who watch clips of girls waving, hugging,
playing flag football. There is little narration; the songs are
``Walking on Sunshine,'' ``These Are The Days,'' ``Forever Young.''
</P>
<P>
   The video ends and the Chi Omega girls link arms and sing the
theme song from ``The Golden Girls.'' ``Thank you for being a
friend . . .'' Even Annie sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   The rushees file out of the house. ``I feel like such an
idiot,'' one says. ``I don't even know these girls and I'm
crying!'' _ _
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Siccardi is a senior from Boca Raton. He is a guy, but he
can watch a rush party because he is the president of the UF's
Interfraternity Council. Sororities have started inviting
fraternity presidents to parties to show they are no longer sitting
around in white gloves drinking tea _ which is what A.J. had
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's shocked at the ``pristine order'' of things. The
group photos with the tiny hearts taped over the faces of the rush
counselors, who have to hide their sorority affiliation this week
while they work with rushees. Conversations stopping when a little
bell rings.
</P>
<P>
   The guys just have food and bands, he said. No one has to go to
a party and no one has to dress up.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Delta Gamma house on Friday, the girls giggle. One
rushee and her Delta Gamma escort are wearing the same J. Crew
dress. Both girls are from Boca Raton. They had never met. ``I was
like, `Cool dress!' '' said Kim Rosemurgy, the rushee. ``It helped
the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   (Later, Kim was accepted to Delta Gamma, her first choice.
``It's like you have automatic friends!'') _ _
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, round three, the rushees have moved from 16 parties
to 10 to six. Girls who aren't invited to a party have to wait it
out in the rushee lounge, an auditorium nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Kraft, a sophomore from Lake Worth, has been here for
four parties straight today.
</P>
<P>
   Her only party is at Phi Mu, which rushees say is one of the
least selective sororities. Kraft says she had good conversations
at some houses, ``but I'm not 5-9 and a size three,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft thinks she's figured out this sorority business. ``AEPhi
and DPhiE have dark hair and are from New York or New Jersey. Zeta
are tall, model types. ChiO and ADPi are more Southern charm _
pearls and immaculate. Tri-Delt is the popular one, that and Zeta
and ADPi and Kappa Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kappa Delta look like girls who would be in Gap ads. I can't
see girls from Zeta going for a hike in the woods. Sigma Kappas are
kind of the nerdy ones.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning she gets the phone call from a sympathetic
rush counselor. Phi Mu, her only hope, dropped her. She cries. She
tells friends she feels like there's something wrong with her.
</P>
<P>
   (On Sunday morning, another call. Two sororities had not met
their quota of 58 people and now want her. She chooses Phi Mu. ``I
just joined the girls like nothing ever happened.'') _ _
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday. Today, rushees will go through the final round
of parties, visiting up to three houses. For the sororities, this
is their last chance to impress; for the rushees, it is the last
chance to sell themselves. Once the final party is over, all
rushees walk to a classroom and rank the three sororities they want
to join. From the time they leave their last party until the lists
are made, there is no talking, so they cannot influence each other.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sororities make their decisions. Some choose
girls they had never met until that week; others they have had
their eye on since reading the Rush Week applications (GPA?
Extracurricular activities?) or letters of recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Some rushees may want sororities that do not want them. For
these girls, there is always next year.
</P>
<P>
   But some may be wanted by more than one sorority. It is for
these girls that the Delta Delta Delta sisters _ known as Tri-Delts
_ are stringing white Christmas lights in the foyer. They are also
waiting on the specially ordered potted trees and moving the piano
into place.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, they will bring the rushees into their meeting room.
The window panes are taped over, blocking any view from outside.
Everything is white. The rushees will sit in a circle with one row
of sorority girls kneeling in front of them and another standing
behind them, singing. Each kneeling girl hands a rushee a pearl to
wish on. The rushee does not keep the pearl.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Tri-Delts will sing softly as the rushees leave
the house: ``Tri-Delt/I'm hoping for Tri-Delt/For a long time I've
felt/It's where I belong . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Freeman, a senior from North Palm Beach, is the sorority
president. She is nervous about her speech tonight. ``We don't want
you to come here and be like us,'' she will tell them. ``We want
you to come here and be like you.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is nervous about seeing her sister, Kate, a rushee. She
will escort Kate herself and for the first time in two weeks, they
will be allowed to talk about rush.
</P>
<P>
   Amy has heard all sorts of questions from other rushees. ``Girls
have asked, `I heard to be in Delta Delta Delta you have to have a
lot of money.' `I heard you guys drive BMWs.' `I heard you have to
have blond hair to be in Zeta.' '' She shakes her head.
Stereotypes, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what else are they going to talk about, sitting under
the tent?'' _ _
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon in their dorm room, Kate Freeman and Kim Seager,
a freshman from Wellington, put on semi-formal dresses and heels.
``Ready to go?'' ``No, are you?'' ``Don't forget your name tag.''
Roommate Kim Balestrieri, who is not rushing, unloads college-sized
groceries. A five-pound jar of peanut butter. A six-pack of mac and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Another rushee runs in, wearing a short blue dress and silver
heels. She's nervous. ``This dress or black?'' They consult. Kim B.
watches, then goes into her room. (``It's not like I hate it or
anything,'' she says. ``It's just not for me.'')
</P>
<P>
   They're ready. Backpacks with a change of clothes for post-party
wear are the last touch. ``This is bizarre,'' Kate says. ``Walking
across campus like this _ `Hey, the first day of school!' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Kim is invited to Chi Omega; Kate joins her sister at
Tri-Delt.) _ _
</P>
<P>
   That evening, girls walk between the rushee lounge and their
next party. Three guys pass, then start talking in girly voices.
``Oh, I've got a stain on my shirt, I've got to change it!''
``Mine's wrinkled, I'll never get in!'' They are not, it turns out,
fraternity boys.
</P>
<P>
   Don Epperson is with campus parking patrol. He has stood on the
same corner during 14 Rush Weeks. ``In the old days, trucks would
drive by with guys out back, yelling,'' he says. ``Well, you've got
over 1,000 pretty girls in one spot. Everyone just wants to come
look.''
</P>
<P>
   His corner is next to the Chi Omega house, a big two-story brick
house with white trim. These girls are his favorite. He likes their
Southern style, he says. ``The balcony helps, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls have Rush Week down to a science, he says. He watches
as doors up and down the street open and rushees leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that?'' he says. ``They're giving the pledges white
carnations! It's a nice touch.'' _ _
</P>
<P>
   These days, the girls are no longer rushees. They are new
members, and are busy now with ``announcing'': dressing in black
and visiting the fraternity houses during dinner. They sing to the
guys. ``Your Chi-O Girl'' set to Brown-Eyed Girl. Something called
Flamin' Zeta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas caroling,'' says Megan Lake of Delray
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   They have to wear their pledge pins every day. Wednesdays, they
wear their sorority shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney says her sorority told them to look good when guys are
around, and if they go to the gym looking ``ratty-tatty'' they
shouldn't wear anything that says Phi Mu.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this might sound bad, but I'm trying to conform to the
house,'' she says. ``I'm trying to fit in. It's not very hard, but
I wear more makeup than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   She likes it. ``You definitely get more attention than just a
regular person.''

 &HT;    Get with the (TV) program: We're entering a golden age of
decency
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nellie and I are news blurter-outers at the breakfast table.
It's almost an agreement that whoever sees something interesting
has to blurt it out to the other so we can discuss it right that
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I blurted the other morning, ``did you see this about
Bud Paxson's 24-hour family channel? Wholesome programming as far
as the eye can see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' my wife said. ``I hope this doesn't turn
out to be Paxson's Folly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. It's for real,'' I insisted. ``Decency is in and
all-family programming makes it official.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure about this decency trend?'' Nellie asked.
``Because I seem to recall sitting through a movie about a guy who
gets his thingy caught in his zipper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between gross humor and indecency,'' I
pontificated, ``even if I can't define it. `There's Something About
Mary' is a vulgar movie about a guy so throughly decent that he
drives 1,500 miles to find his first love even after he's told
she's grossly overweight and uses a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll need a better example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. Amadeus was a decent movie with a few vulgar scenes.
`Lolita' may not have clean language and zero nudity, but the very
idea of a man and a 12-year-old girl is indecent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nellie shrugged and went back to her section of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't convinced. I maintain that there are signs and
portents of a Golden Age of Decency in the offing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's ``King of the Hill'' is funny, endearing and chock full
of wholesome values.
</P>
<P>
   _ Long stay dead ``Married . . . With Children,'' and long live
``Ally McBeal,'' quirkily confronting us with the issues of the
day. Is discrimination ever just? Are wattles sexy?
</P>
<P>
   _ Every hospital drama puts us through an ethical workout that
would exhaust a saint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Could anything be more wholesome and good-natured than ``Win
Ben Stein's Money?'' Will everyone who has even paused on ``Wildcat
Bob's Big Ass Show'' please vigorously self-administer a noogie?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so in our long trek to decency we lost a step when ``Nothing
Sacred'' bit the wafer and Soul Man wasn't picked up for the fall.
But ``Touched by an Angel'' soars and, thanks to Bud Paxson, ``Dr.
Quinn, Medicine Woman'' is out of intensive care and will be
receiving visitors soon.
</P>
<P>
   If Resurgent Decency is not the theme of the New Millennium,
explain to me why we're putting up with someone as annoying as Dr.
Laura? How is it that two of the smartest radio talk show hosts in
the nation _ Jack Cole and Rush Limbaugh _ while political polar
opposites, hammer on the same themes of decency and integrity?
</P>
<P>
   I salute Bud Paxson and his all-day all-family television
network, and lift a glass of O'Doul's to his success. May the
critics one day look back and say, ``If Bud Paxson didn't exist, we
would have had to invent him.''

 &HT;    Eccentric Mott kept costs down
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Stewart Mott once, the story goes, changed a 30-watt
refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save electricity.
</P>
<P>
   That might not have been unusual for someone who'd endured the
Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the country's
15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered one of the
richest men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he prized simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   He had left his father's cider business in 1900 to make one of
America's legendary automotive fortunes. But he made his own home a
working farm _ and insisted his family eat all the homegrown
produce before buying any.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this house wants yellow tomato juice, it had better make it
during the season,'' he once decreed, according to a family history
published by the University of Michigan at Flint.
</P>
<P>
   But C.S. Mott was as generous as he was thrifty _ and, perhaps
not surprising, thrifty about the business of being generous.
During his time, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation roosted in an
office with obviously patched carpet; the office manager had to buy
his own air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a fortune valued at $300 millionchecking with jen,
main says $500 million at last count, C.S. Mott left his family a
commitment to charity. His widow, his six children and several of
his grandchildren themselves became philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   Their interests range but have common themes _ like promoting
peace and revitalizing Flint, said William White, C.S. Mott's
grandson-in-law and the current head of the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation. It remains the largest of the family's philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best known of C.S. Mott's descendants is son
Stewart Rawlings Mott. He considers himself the family's ``black
sheep, maverick, whatever you want to call it'' for his liberal
politics and flamboyant style. But in some ways, he didn't fall far
from the Mott family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Mott has given away half his income for decades, but
he's been known to do it from an apartment with peeling paint and
rundown furniture. It was a Park Avenue penthouse, yes, but he grew
his own vegetables and raised his own chickens on the roof (to the
dismay of his neighbors, who eventually had a court order him to
stick to his own terrace. He moved.)
</P>
<P>
   His plunges into politics are not surprising for the son of a
three-time Flint mayor. But father and son were more than six
decades apart in age and just as far in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked to (C.S. Mott), the veteran of the
Spanish-American War, about laying down our nuclear weapons with
the enemy, he thought I was wacko,'' Stewart Mott said. ``My father
just found me too argumentative.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, he said, that he wasn't welcome at his father's
foundation. So he carved out his own brand of philanthropy: part
giving money, part raising it; part politics; and part just plain
party.
</P>
<P>
   He gave hefty donations to the presidential campaigns of Eugene
McCarthy, George McGovern and later, John Anderson. His $400,000
contribution made him McGovern's most generous supporter and earned
him a spot on the Nixon White House's enemies list. He mounted his
own campaign to stop the Vietnam War from Washington to the General
Motors Corp. boardroom, where he criticized the company that made
his fortune for not speaking out against the war.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I wasn't crusading against my father,'' Stewart Mott said.
``No way. I was just going a different path.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides high-profile work, there was high-profile play, like his
40th birthday party in New York in 1977, which he still talks
about. The former Columbia drama student asked his 680 guests to
dress in Medieval garb and staged his own script of a King Arthur
legend.
</P>
<P>
   For a 1983 party to celebrate his work in Washington, he urged
guests to ride an elephant on the sidewalk and wear gold sashes
emblazoned with a French saying that means, roughly, ``Shame on
those who think badly of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 61 and living mostly in North Salem, N.Y., Stewart Mott has
stayed largely out of the limelight in recent years. But he said he
still gives $750,000 to $800,000 a year to organizations promoting
peace, population control, government reform and civil rights.

 &HT;    Experimental care not covered, insurer said
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jupiter resident Lise Greene's fight with her HMO is nothing
unusual in the insurance world.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is a judge forced her managed-care insurance
company, Well Care HMO, to pay for her hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for bladder damage. Well Care argued that the procedure is
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only known injunction of its kind in Florida, and it
could lead to more people seeking similar judgments in the future,
say Greene's lawyer, Gary M. Farmer Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, and a
lawyer who specializes in health-care law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for patients. . . . It's not so good for
HMOs,'' said Jeff Cohen, a Delray Beach lawyer and former chairman
of managed-care law for the Florida Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's problems began in March 1997 when she was diagnosed
with uterine cancer. The radiation treatment damaged her bladder,
and by Christmas she developed persistent hemorrhagic cystitis,
which results in bleeding and the inability to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a car ride and having to really go to the bathroom and
magnify that 10 or 20 times,'' Farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO said it would pay for a treatment that required Greene
to have surgery so she could again go to the bathroom. Using this
treatment, she said her doctors told her, eventually her bladder
would shrink to nothing. From March to June this year, Greene had
six surgeries costing from about $12,000 to $32,000. The total bill
far exceeds the cost of the hyperbaric oxygen treatment Greene's
doctors had recommended. They estimate she will need about 40
treatments at a cost of $1,100 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting really because we had a solution to
everything,'' Greene says. ``We would not have had to go through
all this (surgery), and they would have saved a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said maybe Well Care didn't want to pay for Greene's
hyperbaric treatment because then it would have to pay for it in
other cases where alternative treatments might cost less. In court
documents Well Care's attorney, Thomas S. Rutherford of Tampa,
pointed out Well Care was willing to pay for all Greene's other
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbaric oxygen chamber is commonly known for treating the
bends in scuba divers. However, it is used for everything from
healing wounds to radiation damage in the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how it heals is not known, but anecdotal evidence is it
works, says Dr. Roy Duke, one of three doctors who work with the
chambers at St. Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene enters a chamber at St. Mary's, a hood is placed on
her, and she breathes 100 percent oxygen while the air in the
chamber is as if she were about 40 feet below sea level, forcing
more oxygen into her system. At intervals, the hood is taken off so
the patient can take a break, Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care argued that it didn't have to pay for the hyperbaric
treatments because they were considered experimental and thus not
covered under Greene's insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer argued that the treatments for Greene's condition
have been effectively used since the early 1980s and couldn't be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's arguments prevailed with Circuit Judge Edward Fine, who
granted a preliminary injunction forcing Well Care to pay for the
treatments while the company appealed the decision. Greene posted a
$1,000 bond in case she lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that plaintiff has shown a substantial
likelihood that she will prevail on the merits of her claim for
health insurance coverage,'' Fine wrote in his July 2 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are forced to pay for their treatment while
they appeal HMO decisions. They usually only sue after the fact for
repayment. But Greene could not even do that, Farmer said. Even
though Greene said she would pay for the treatments herself, the
hospital wanted proof of insurance coverage because the treatments
are so expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care appealed, but has since withdrawn the appeal, Farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put my client through six months of entirely unnecessary
physical suffering and mental strain,'' he said.

 &HT;    Powerful Mott foundation, U.S. Sugar make odd partners

<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Meet the United States Sugar Corp., the
small-town company that's one of America's biggest producers of
sugar and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the physical and spiritual heart of this city on
the southern end of Lake Okeechobee. Clewiston is glad to be a
company town: U.S. Sugar employs 3,100 people and pays an average
of $34,000 a year in a region where the land is rich but many
people are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now meet U.S. Sugar's quiet but important partner, 1,100 miles
away in Flint, Mich., the home of General Motors Corp.'s Buick
division.
</P>
<P>
   People therehere measure prosperity not by the cars they drive
but by the cars they build. And much as nearly everything in
Clewiston bears the stamp of U.S. Sugar, nearly everything in Flint
bears the stamp of General Motors and an early G.M. investor named
Charles Stewart Mott.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Flint is the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation,
the country's 15th-largest enterprise of its kind as of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation gives away up to $72 million a year, gets
the president's attention and sits on $58 million worth of U.S.
Sugar stock, making the charity one of the sugar company's biggest
stockholders. Those holdings also make the sugar company stock one
of the charity's biggest assets.
</P>
<P>
   The two entities even share a chairman. But at times, their
interests conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most curious relationships possible,'' says
Nathaniel Reed, a Florida environmental activist and former
assistant secretary of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can close your eyes and say, `For the greater good of our
foundation grants, I close my eyes' '' to the source of the money,
Reed said. ``And a lot of damage has been done to the world by
wonderful people who close their eyes for a variety of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation pledged $16.5 million this decade to
``prevention of toxic pollution,'' the company paid a record $3.7
million fine for dumping hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation put $630,000 into preserving South
America's Pantanal, the world's largest freshwater wetland, the
company put up $10 million to fight a proposed tax to preserve
Florida's great freshwater wetland, the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation spent $180,000 to reduce pollution from
farms, the company balked at suggestions that farmers should pay
the bulk of the bill for cleaning up phosphorus pollution heading
to the Everglades. Scientists say the biggest source of the
phosphorus is the sugar-growing region south of Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar says it's doing its best for the environment, adding
that it already has spent $31 million on Everglades restoration.
Still, the Everglades debate puts the company at odds with some of
the same organizations the Mott foundation supports.
</P>
<P>
   In a June letter to President Clinton, the Sierra Club's
executive director blasted the ``Mott family'' for U.S. Sugar's
position in the Everglades _ though the Mott foundation reports it
has given the Sierra Club $1.5 million during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental activists have asked the foundation directly
for help with the Everglades; in part because of its business
interests, the foundation said no.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts William S. White in a rather hot seat, since he
both runs the Mott foundation and chairs U.S. Sugar's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't be human,'' he said, ``if you didn't feel a
little anxiety when, on the one hand, you're funding someone and on
the next hand, another part of their organization is bopping you on
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott foundation one man's work
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation has a fortune of more than $1.9 billion,
according to its latest annual report. Its beneficiaries range from
``an organization that explores the fundamental global issues of
our times'' to a ``fledgling network of 60 knitters.''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee has consulted its chairman on rebuilding
inner cities. Both former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former
Vice President Dan Quayle were interviewed for its 1995 annual
report. This year, Clinton gave a pressnews conference to announce
the foundation's ``astonishing'' $55 million pledge to improve
after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   This all stems from a struggling wire-wheel company in Utica,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stewart Mott was born in 1875 into the family
responsible for Mott's applesauce and apple juice, though those
ties have been severed.
</P>
<P>
   Mott became a mechanical engineer, joined his uncle's wheel
company and quickly started making axles for a promising new
product: automobiles. He moved the company to Flint to be closer to
his customers at Buick. Then he sold his axle business for stock in
a fledgling company called General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   By World War II, he was considered one of the richest men in
America, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. By the time he
died, at age 97, his fortune was estimated at $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he bought a bankrupt sugar-farming outfit deep in
Florida and turned it into U.S. Sugar, now a $430 million-a-year
business.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the Mott foundation and gave it much of his
fortune, including a 50 percent stake in U.S. Sugar, said White _
who also is C.S. Mott's grandson-in-law. He said the foundation
later sold some of its stock to the employee stock plan and gave
some to other charities, mostly the Mott Children's Health Center,
a Flint hospital that started as part of the foundation but became
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the foundation and the health center each own 15 to 20
percent of the company, White said. That puts them second only to
thousands of current and former workers who got stock through the
employee plan when the workers are counted as a group.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar stock was the foundation's most valuable asset as
recently as 1996, but White said it's now second to the
foundation's holdings in General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man is in partnership with the rest of the human race in
the eternal conquest which we call civilization,'' Mott once
explained.
</P>
<P>
   'You can probably criticize us'
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, no one denies they add up to a significant
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. Sugar, the Mott stake means stockholders who ``bring
their values'' to the boardroom, Vice President Robert Buker said.
``They're concerned about the bottom line. But they'll say, `What
is our commitment to the community?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the foundation, White said, it means a special concern for
the Glades.
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation spends more money on relieving poverty than
on anything else, its reports show. It makes a point of beginning
that charity at home in Flint, which has suffered alongside the
auto industry since the 1970s. The foundation has put nearly $82
million into Flint in this decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   In its 72 years, the foundation has spent a total of only $1.2
million in the Glades, where the 1990 Census found virtually the
same conditions as in Flint: About a third of the population lives
in poverty; 40 percent of the adults didn't finish high school; the
average household gets by on about $25,000 a year, a full quarter
less than the average for Palm Beach County. And in 1994, U.S.
Sugar's decision to stop vegetable farming in the Glades led to 40
percent unemployment in the already poor city of South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Mott's $1.2 million went to the Glades Community Development
Corp., which aims to improve an area of 43,000 people, according to
the Census. The foundation spent about as much in three years in
one Flint neighborhood of 6,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can probably criticize us and say, `Why the hell haven't
you done more?' '' in the Glades, White acknowledged. ``It could
use more money.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar 'good corporate citizen'
</P>
<P>
   But here's what else the Mott foundation has done for the
Glades, White said: build U.S. Sugar into a ``good corporate
citizen'' in the area where 85 percent of its workers live. The
company itself gave more than $1 million to schools, youth groups
and health care organizations, most of them local, in 1996, the
last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar also led its industry in improving working conditions
for the thousands of West Indians who used to cut Florida's sugar
cane by hand, agreeing in 1992 to make changes while other growers
kept fighting lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar officials say they've been leaders in the Everglades'
restoration. But there's some disagreement about that.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration aims to cut the phosphorus, a natural
fertilizer, coming into the Everglades. Government studies show the
bulk of it washes off the Glades farming region.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say they're doing their part. They're paying at least
$233 million toward building $763 million worth of marshes to
filter the water, selling the government the land for the marshes
and limiting the phosphorus leaving their farms _ ahead of schedule
so far.
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. Sugar, ``we're in business to produce crops and make a
living, but we're also doing things to protect the environment,''
President J. Nelson Fairbanks said. ``We would do anything we
thought we could afford that we thought was necessary to save the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But some environmental activists say the growers need to do more
because the farms are responsible for so much of the phosphorus and
have drawn on South Florida's government-built canals for
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Mott foundation could come in, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict in how it earns, spends money?
</P>
<P>
   Some activists _ including representatives of the Florida
Audobon Society, the World Wildlife Fund and Save Our Everglades _
say they and colleagues have asked the Mott foundation to try to
change U.S. Sugar's positions on sticking points in the Everglades
plans. Others say they've asked the foundation to give money to
Everglades efforts.
</P>
<P>
   All say they got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you'd think that someone who's made that much money
from the people and from the land would be willing to put some
money back into preserving the land,'' fumed Save Our Everglades
chief Mary Barley.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Sugar's chairman, White says the company is trying its
best.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mott foundation's chairman, he says there's not much he
can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Give money? ``A lot of people would look at it as tainted money
or conflict of interest,'' he said. Besides, he noted, the money
promised so far hasn't stopped the battles.
</P>
<P>
   Change company positions? Even as chairman of the board, ``I
cannot tell (the management), `Go do this,' '' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Many foundation managers debate whether the way they earn their
money conflicts with the way they spend it, charity experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations decide only to invest in companies they
consider socially responsible or environmentally friendly. But many
others feel that just makes it harder to make the money they're
going to give away.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Fairbanks, the U.S. Sugar president, puts it: ``If
it weren't for business and the profits of business, there would be
no charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff researchers Michelle Quigley and Lynne Palombo contributed
to this story.
</P>
<P>
   How the Mott Foundation spends its money
</P>
<P>
   . . . and how it differs from U.S. Sugar
</P>
<P>
   Spent $710,000 to challenge a plan to widen 2,000 miles of South
American rivers, saying it would harm the Pantanal, the world's
largest freshwater wetland ($630,000); and to urge U.S. farmers to
control polluted water coming off fields ($80,000).
</P>
<P>
   Spent more than $1.5 million for the Sierra Club Foundation and
the club's Canada affiliate; $807,000 for the National Wildlife
Federation; and $450,000 for the National Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Spent $200,000 to clean up California land contaminated by
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Spent $44,000 to study the property-rights movement, which
advances owners' rights when government restricts land use. The
foundation says it could `undermine' environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, U.S. Sugar:
</P>
<P>
   Spent about $10 million to defeat a proposed penny-a-pound sugar
tax to raise money to restore Florida's major freshwater wetland,
the Everglades. Studies show water from sugar cane fields carries
much of the pollutant that is harming the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Opposed Florida affiliates of the Sierra Club, the National
Wildlife Federation and the National Audubon Society over the sugar
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Paid a record $3.7 million fine in 1991 for mishandling
hazardous sugar-mill chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Supported Flo-Sun's effort to make sure the state pays
landowners' legal fees when it condemns property for conservation.
Environmentalists and Gov. Chiles said the proposals would
compromise Everglades restoration, but U.S. Sugar executives said
they were trying to ensure fair prices.

 &HT;    Rescue training for swift waters proves valuable
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jesse Tarin learned the importance of
swift-water rescue training the hard way more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was a ranger at Enchanted Rock State Park near
Fredericksburg. Flooding in Crabapple Creek in Llano County had
swept a car from a low-water crossing. Fearing that the driver was
still inside, Tarin tied a rope around himself and waded in without
a life jacket. Floating debris snagged the rope and nearly pulled
him under.
</P>
<P>
   Tarin did everything wrong _ and for nothing. The driver already
had been swept two miles downstream and crawled out safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was risking myself for no reason at all,'' Tarin said.
``That was my lesson. About a third of the drowning victims in the
United States are would-be rescuers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as director of public safety for parks at the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department, Tarin is a believer in swift-water rescue
training and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The basic skills and tools are fairly low-tech. A life jacket
will help keep the rescuer alive. Victims can be hauled ashore with
a ``throw bag'' _ a small bag that measures about a foot long and 6
inches in diameter, with a 50- to 75-foot rope stuffed inside. The
rope is made of a buoyant material, such as polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a little practice, you can pitch that rope out 50 to 60
feet,'' Tarin said. ``Hopefully it reaches the victim, and you can
pull him to shore. The last thing you want to do is get in the
water and swim after someone. That's a high-risk option.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty to 40 percent of state park workers in flood-prone areas
have received swift-water rescue training, Tarin said. Newly hired
game wardens also receive training.
</P>
<P>
   For a nationally ranked team of swift-water rescuers, look no
further than the City of Austin. Each city firefighter and medic
has received basic training, and many have undergone advanced
training, said Casey Ping, commander of special operations for
Austin's Emergency Medical Services.
</P>
<P>
   All city fire and medical trucks are equipped with life jackets,
throw bags and special helmets that drain water.
</P>
<P>
   Austin EMS workers received a program-development award this
year from the Swiftwater Rescue Committee of the National
Association for Search and Rescue.

 &HT;    McGwire's tribute to father, son
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, FLA. - The moment was the perfect tribute of a father
to a son, of a son to a father.
</P>
<P>
   Of a son to another's father.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run Monday, it wasn't just
for him or his teammates or the 50,530 fans at Busch Stadium or
even for history.
</P>
<P>
   It was for his dad, John, who was celebrating his 61st birthday.
It was for his 10-year-old son, Matt, who arrived at the stadium
just in time to see his father's immortal swing.
</P>
<P>
   It was for Roger Maris, who is the only other man ever to hit 61
home runs, and for his four sons, who watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   It also was for Mike Davidson, the 28-year-old catering manager
from St. Louis who caught the ball and can't wait till the moment
his unborn child is old enough to understand what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over to the left and there was my son,'' said McGwire
of the moment he started toward home. ``I didn't see him today
until I went to get my bat after the top of the first. I told him I
loved him and gave him a kiss. The next thing I know, I see him at
home plate. What a wonderful thing for a father.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hugged his son and lifted him over his face. Words
weren't necessary. Matt laughed. McGwire grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was how awesome it would be to share a
moment like that with my only child,'' teammate Tom Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute continued. McGwire pointed at his father. Then he
pointed at his heart, the sky and then the Maris brothers, so
they'd know their own father was with him. They stood and watched
the home run, applauding politely.
</P>
<P>
   It must've hurt, for a moment, to see their father's record
tied. But now he's not alone, as he must've felt when he was going
for the 34-year-old record of Babe Ruth in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The nation was not pulling for Maris, as it is for McGwire. Even
his New York Yankees teammates back then rooted for another, as
Mickey Mantle closed in on the record, too.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire met with the Maris family in front of the Cardinals'
dugout after the game. It was too public a spot to get too
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all thanked me and gave me a hug,'' McGwire said. ``I'd
love to meet with them someday when this is all over and tell them
the feelings their father was feeling, and having them understand
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, he's in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is 34, the same age Maris was when he retired. McGwire
returned after the game to the same clubhouse in which Maris
finished his career.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved the same goal as Maris. But most of Maris' six
children were not born yet in '61. They never got a chance to
experience what Matt did, to watch their father achieve the
unachievable. That is why it was so important for McGwire to see
the look in his own son's eyes, a memory neither will forget.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire thought of his father, a retired dentist, on his way to
the ballpark. Things have gotten a bit hectic for McGwire lately
and he didn't have a chance to call him before the game.
</P>
<P>
   He figured a home run would make for the perfect gift. And he
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever let go of the moment,'' McGwire said.
``I don't know if I'll ever be here again. The whole time I
thought, `What a great birthday present for my dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What a great present for everyone's dad. For anyone's son.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ I can think of few prospects less appealing than
being treated to a recitation of Dan Burton's sleepovers. If we are
on the verge of an unwelcome contest in sexual gotcha, the larger
push for it will come from within the press itself than from any
White House pressure. There's precedent. (Teepen, Cox News Service)

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ NEWS ITEM: The U.S. Department of
Transportation has ordered airlines to create peanut-free buffer
zones on flights when a person with an allergy to peanuts is aboard
_ one row in front of the allergic person, one row behind and, of
course, the row the allergic person is sitting in. Dear Department
of Transportation: I'd like to speak with you about perfume. Howard

   MURRAY-COLUMN08 _ RIGA, Latvia _ If you're a tall, blond,
beautiful woman who is tired of standing out in the crowd, come to
Riga. It's like a pretty woman parade all day and into the night,
long-legged women in short skirts and high-heel shoes. None of
them, alas, was wearing her dancing shoes. (Murray, Cox News

<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN09 _ What I didn't know about the Baltics until I

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ On the airline, we called it
``Smile School'' _ a derogatory term for the mandatory six weeks of

Schooling was occasionally ludicrous, sometimes interesting, and
frequently boring, but it came with the territory. (Schuett, Cox

   KABAT-COLUMN _ There are many good reasons behind my return to
the workforce fulltime, but I didn't note one of the best until
recently. ``Here's what I want you to do,'' I told my son. ``When
you get home from school, immediately practice your clarinet. You
can do any other homework later, but always practice your clarinet
first.'' Just to make sure, I call home before I leave the office.
I think he can squeak by without me on this one. (Kabat, Waco

<P>
   For a guy with a reputation for brains, Ben Stiller has managed
to upstage _ and ultimately degrade _ himself with other body parts
recently.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's ``There's Something About Mary,'' he was the
high-school geek who got his privates caught in his zipper on the
hottest date of his life _ only to have it become suburban legend.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Permanent Midnight,'' based on TV writer Jerry
Stahl's memoirs of his addiction to drugs, he shoots up anywhere he
can find a vein _ even in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' director Neil LaBute's
dark follow-up to last year's ``In the Company of Men,'' Stiller
has several graphic semi-nude sex scenes _ in which he fails to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it takes a lot of guts to play a loser. But Stiller's not
quite ready to see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after these three movies,'' the 32-year-old actormuses thoughtfully over a lobster salad lunch at Da Silvano in New
York, ``I did have to stop and wonder _ why did they see me in
these roles? People wind up believing you are the characters you
play. What does it say about me that I played three dysfunctional
guys in a row, who do hugely embarrassing things?''
</P>
<P>
   He stops to laugh at little at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he adds, ``those movies say I like to push
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd be telling the truth. The man who launched his career
with the critically acclaimed comedy program the ``Ben Stiller
Show'' is serious and intensely motivated, a hard worker hellbent
on success on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's not a guy driven by ego,'' LaBute explains. ``He
displayed a lot of fearlessness. I think when he was doing those
sex scenes, he was totally in the moment, totally there. He did it
and didn't think too much. But later on, when we screened the
movie, he was terrified to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Stiller says, ``because the things I did on
screen this year are things in my life I'm so not open about _ at
all. I don't really talk about sex _ it's not my thing. But ever
since I did `Flirting With Disaster,' which also dealt with sexual
situations, I keep getting scripts like this. Stuff comes up in
your life and your work that you kind of need to deal with. Nothing
like having to work it out in public!''
</P>
<P>
   Since he began working on ``Permanent Midnight,'' Stiller became
close friends with Stahl (best known for his writing on '80s hits
like``Moonlighting'' and ``Thirtysomething''), who served as his
technical _ and spiritual _ adviser. The media's already dubbed
them ``the new Ben &AMP; Jerry.'' The pair got along so well, they
wrote an adaptation together of Budd Schulberg's 1941 classic
Hollywood novel, ``What Makes Sammy Run'' that they're pushing to
have produced.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, Stiller was recovering from his breakup with
long-term girlfriend Jeanne Tripplehorn, which may have helped him
lose the 28 pounds to bring him to junkie weight, but also made him
focus even harder on work. So after wrapping ``Midnight'' _ and
finally being able to eat again _ he got the script for the equally
dark ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' and decided to jump into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just seen `In the Company of Men,''' he says, ``and Jason
Patric, who was producing the movie, called and asked me if I'd
meet Neil LaBute. It was one of those things, like getting a call
from Albert Brooks, where I wouldn't even have to look at a script
_ I knew I'd just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller had been itching to break into drama after years of
stand-up comedy, parody and satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaked out my agent,'' he says. ``None of the characters
in this movie is redeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the acting part of his year has wound down, the Los
Angeles-based Stiller has rented a New York apartment where he can
concentrate on writing. He just produced a movie called ``The
Suburbans'' about a one-hit-wonder '80s band and is developing a
movie about the Hardy men _ a grown-up version of the Hardy Boys.
</P>
<P>
   He's also readying the updated version of ``Sammy'' (and plans
to write more with Stahl), wants to collaborate with LaBute and is
developing a movie about Derrick, the brain-dead male supermodel
character he invented for the VH-1 Fashion Awards. Paramount
greenlighted it for a midsized budget without even seeing a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole world is ripe for parody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was Joel Gallen, the executive producer of the Fashion
Awards, who suggested turning the skit, which Stiller co-wrote with
``Newsradio'' writer Drake Saylor into a movie. But then there was
the problem of turning a two-minute sketch into a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we should take this character, who's really not that
smart, and put him into a sophisticated espionage thriller along
the lines of `The Day of the Jackal' or `Patriot Games.' So we came
up with this idea: Derrick is having a midlife crisis as he
approaches 30. He loses VH-1 Model of the Year after winning two
years in a row. He's crushed _ there's this other model named Hans
who's on the rise _ so he's having this dark night of the soul.
Meanwhile, he gets picked by a super-secret government agency to
assassinate a world leader. Turns out, in our movie, male models
are perfect assassins _ they don't really talk, and they have easy
access to world leaders. We show how every assassination in the
last 100 years was done by a male model. I want it to be incredibly
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller may be on a major roll, but he's worried it will drive
him to Workaholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, acting, writing and directing fulfill the need I have
to get outside myself,'' he explains. ``Work numbs the pain. I saw
Elizabeth Shue recently; she just had a baby, and she was saying
her priorities are changing. She had this vision of all of us, her
friends, as workaholics _ becoming just a little stack of videos in
the video store, with no other lives. It's such cold comfort. But
unfortunately, the best work does come out of the most painful
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, though, that there's a limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely tired of playing those loser roles,'' he says,
then pauses. ``Unless,'' he adds, ``they're really, really
funny.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ On the airline, we called it ``Smile School''
_ a derogatory term for the mandatory six weeks of training all
newly hired flight attendants were required to endure. Schooling
was occasionally ludicrous, sometimes interesting, and frequently
boring, but it came with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile!'' we were commanded. ``That passenger is paying your
salary.''
</P>
<P>
   And smile we did _ through delays, broken airplanes, canceled
flights, bomb threats, thunderstorms, cold casseroles, and
overflowing barf bags. Boy were we cheerful!
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always easy. Like the time we were landing in
Louisville and the lady in 3A asked what time we were going to

   KABAT-COLUMN _ There are many good reasons behind my return to
the workforce fulltime, but I didn't note one of the best until
recently. ``Here's what I want you to do,'' I told my son. ``When
you get home from school, immediately practice your clarinet. You
can do any other homework later, but always practice your clarinet
first.'' Just to make sure, I call home before I leave the office.
I think he can squeak by without me on this one. (Kabat, Waco

FEINSTEIN'S SILENCE SPEAKS LOUDLY ABOUT THE CLINTON AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whether President Clinton corrupted Monica Lewinsky
is a subject for clergymen. That he has corrupted the language in
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   Caught having sex with the intern, he denied having ``sexual
relations.'' It's the listener's fault, he insisted last month on
national television, for not catching his drift. He regretted
having ``misled'' us.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of September has brought a new cargo of verbal
rubble. It was not until Friday that the man who admitted to a
liaison that was ``not appropriate'' could be coaxed to utter the
two words that properly express an apology. Again, the blame for
the failed communication is hung on the listener. From Moscow, a
disappointed Clinton says that he has gone to the trouble of
re-reading his Aug. 17 televised speech to the nation and can find
no deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it must be the listener's fault.
</P>
<P>
   If the man in the Oval Office remains tongued-tied about his
behavior during all those 18 months in the room adjoining the Oval
Office _ and all those seven months of brazen cover-up _ another
American leader is teaching us the power of a few words spoken with
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was present in the Roosevelt Room in January when the
president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica
Lewinsky. I believed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense of sadness
in that my trust in his credibility had been badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Sen. Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the
president's address on Aug. 17. Feinstein, D-Calif., has issued no
public statement since. On the hottest topic in Washington, she has
refused to give journalists what they desire most: words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, followed as it has been by these weeks of heavy silence,
Feinstein's statement continues to echo, just as Clinton's can
still be heard, thanks to the unforgiving videotape, making that
dreadful, point-of-no-return denial back in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I want to say one thing to the American people,'' Clinton
said, his finger pointing into the camera like an Uncle Sam ``I
WANT YOU'' poster. ``I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say
this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman ...
Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   To Feinstein, those unforgettable, unretractable words were not
those of a politician denying something for which he was
embarrassed. They were the words of a political contract: I'm
telling you the truth. Now, you go out and defend me.
</P>
<P>
   Today Clinton must contend with the outrage of those who spent
winter, spring and summer honoring their end of that contract _
only to learn it was all a sham. In this twilight struggle, the
senator from California has been especially eloquent, conveying the
disquiet of her soul in the quiet of her bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Such discretion is enviable in today's climate. Where Feinstein
has avoided the contamination of the Lewinsky Affair, others have
not been so lucky. She has learned the hard way that once a few
words have been spoken on this sordid affair, the surest way to
protect your honor is to keep your distance; the best way to
declare your outrage is to keep an impressive silence.

INVESTING IN OURSELVES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The image has become almost cliched. Wall Street
has a bad day, and the universal illustration is a photo of a
trader, grimacing or pulling at his hair or slumping dejectedly
with his face in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   If one didn't know the context, one would assume the worst.
Terminal cancer? Family wiped out in a car crash? War?
</P>
<P>
   Each time I see such a photo, I find myself wondering what life
in these United States will be like when Wall Street has many bad
days in a row. And the days become weeks. And maybe months. Based
on what so many of us have done with the unprecedented prosperity
of the last few years _ how generously and graciously we've handled
it _ just imagine our behavior when the going gets what Americans
call ``tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be really ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Not just the layoffs, downsizings and wholesale closings _ all
in the name of our unofficial national deity, The Bottom Line.
Imagine all the justifiable selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that at the end of last year there were
approximately 4 million millionaires in the United States? That's
the same number of people who live in Alabama or who make up the
greater metropolitan areas of Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., and
Denver-Boulder combined.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were 170 billionaires, individuals worth at
least a thousand million dollars. In 1997 alone, the wealth of this
country increased by $1.4 trillion, with half that increase
occurring among families or individuals who make more than $200,000
per year.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the rest of us, working stiffs who do our shopping
at Wal-Mart and Grand Auto, thank you, not Neiman Marcus and
Jaguar? Many of us look at the millionaires and billionaires and we
call ourselves poor. Yet compared to most people in the rest of the
world _ and too many people in our own midst _ we're swimming in
wealth. Millions of us have more than enough to meet basic human
needs _ so much more that we've embraced a national lie, believing
with all our hearts that our wants are necessities.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a set of economic circumstances in which a
nation's people were freed of need so that they might seriously
mitigate the age-old social demons of poverty, hunger and
ignorance, these past years in the United States should have been
those circumstances. If ever a nation's public school and health
systems, its arts organizations and physical infrastructure should
reflect such boom times for so many, it should be ours.
</P>
<P>
   Have we instinctively (and compassionately) cared for those who
do not have enough? Have our lawmakers tried to level a severely
slanted economic playing field? Have we invested lavish amounts of
our good fortune in the most precious legacy a nation can provide,
its guarantee of a fine public education?
</P>
<P>
   Look around.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think of the millionaires and billionaires as
greedy, but few of the rest of us care to accept that mantle. Why,
if we had $20 million or so, we say, we'd be generous as hell. We'd
be in a position to share. Besides, we donate what we can afford _
which means we give until it starts to cut in on our ability to
satisfy our wants.
</P>
<P>
   In these past years of so many great days on Wall Street,
millions of us have worked longer hours, willingly raided our
savings or paid a bank 19 percent interest for plastic credit so
that we could acquire more things and experiences. How many of us
worked harder, used savings or paid 19 percent interest so that we
could help feed the hungry, house the homeless, provide medical and
psychiatric care for the destitute or ensure the survival of decent
public education?
</P>
<P>
   How many of us would have donated half as much to charity if our
philanthropy were not tax deductible? How many of us would have
given anything?
</P>
<P>
   Want becomes greed, not when people buy and consume, but when
they no longer can recognize that they have enough. And greed is an
equal opportunity sin. Whether they make $50,000 a year, $500,000
or $5 billion, greedy people believe they need more _ to spend on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In prosperous times, when it should have been so easy to share,
so natural to invest in the collective future, we have stigmatized
and dehumanized the have-nots and allowed selfishness to reign.
When the inevitable occurs, and those days of soaring Dows are the
exception, how pretty do you suppose the picture will be?

 &HT;    COLUMN: Smile, whether you're happy about it or not
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ On the airline, we called it ``Smile School''
_ a derogatory term for the mandatory six weeks of training all
newly hired flight attendants were required to endure. Schooling
was occasionally ludicrous, sometimes interesting, and frequently
boring, but it came with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile!'' we were commanded. ``That passenger is paying your
salary.''
</P>
<P>
   And smile we did _ through delays, broken airplanes, canceled
flights, bomb threats, thunderstorms, cold casseroles, and
overflowing barf bags. Boy were we cheerful!
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always easy. Like the time we were landing in
Louisville and the lady in 3A asked what time we were going to
arrive in Indianapolis. I SMILED, explaining we'd just come from
there, and our next stop would be Charlotte. The once cheerful
passenger was suddenly not happy, the agent at the gate wasn't
happy, the captain wasn't happy, and when I got back to Chicago two
days later, my chief flight attendant was REALLY unhappy. But I
kept on smiling _ it was my job.
</P>
<P>
   One night my concerned roommate forcefully shouldered her way
through the bi-fold bathroom door on a Constellation, landed
face-down on the scuffed green floor, and looked up at the startled
gentleman with his trousers around his ankles and a newspaper
covering his vitals. Turning on her most DAZZLING SMILE, she backed
out on all fours, apologizing: ``Oh sir, I'm so sorry. You've been
in here over an hour and when you didn't respond to my knocks, I
was afraid you'd had a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   I KEPT SMILING that stormy night, somewhere between Atlanta and
Nashville, as a line of thunderstorms tossed our airplane
every-which-way but up and a gentleman with an expensive briefcase
and an attitude to match demanded a chilled martini or my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' I explained with what I hoped was a DISARMING SMILE as
I clung to the overhead for dear life, ``there is nothing I would
rather do at this moment than mix a shaker of martinis and sit down
and have one with you, but we have no liquor kit on this
airplane.'' I managed to squeeze out one more APOLOGETIC SMILE
before I lost my grip and went sprawling onto the heaving aisle
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The smile was a part of my job.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow flight attendants and I SMILED our way through
innumerable gagsters armed with insidious grins, raised eyebrows,
and the same boring line: ``Coffee, tea or me? Huh, honey?''
</P>
<P>
   One of my colleagues on a nightcoach from Chicago to San Juan
even mustered up a STARTLED SMILE the night she had to explain to a
young couple that if they insisted on flying ``United'' they
couldn't fly Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   And once in a while when a passenger got a little too friendly,
I'd remind him with as GRACIOUS a SMILE as I could muster that if
he didn't remove his offending hand from wherever it had come to
rest, no doubt accidentally, then I would have to call in my Uncle
Luigi, the notorious knee-cracker from the south side of Chicago,
to deal with the situation. It always worked. And everyone kept
SMILING.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in the Flight Manual, posted on the wall in
Operations, and always on the lips of our supervisors: SMILE. THAT
PASSENGER IS PAYING HIS WAY _ AND YOURS.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm having a hard time working up any sympathy for
the 12 Safeway employees (11 women and 1 man) in California who are
suing the store because the company thinks it's a good idea for its
employees to smile at the customers. One complains she has been
``hit on'' by men who think she is ``coming on'' to them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Another frivolous lawsuit, another nail in the coffin of
independence and self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   I've said it before but that won't stop me from saying it again:
We are fast becoming a nation of litigious wimps. Can't we just
grow up?

THINKING ABOUT NEXT SUMMER ON THE FINGER LAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<P>
   PANN YAN, N.Y. _ They're not fancy.
</P>
<P>
   They're modest little cottages squatting on a wooded hillside in
the Finger Lakes. They're high enough off the water that a mountain
goat could get shin splints clambering back and forth to the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   At water's edge, I've built some crude, shaky docks. Every few
winters, ice crunches the docks into kindling. If Al Gore is right
about global warming, I won't have to put up with that forever.
</P>
<P>
   I run there every chance I get, dodging semis on the New York
Thruway for four hours each way. My reward _ a few days in the
peaceful place I knew as a child. Sometimes, when I have work to
do, my only companion is a golden retriever. I sit on the dock and
read while he paddles after ducks. I sit on the porch and write, as
I'm doing now, while he wanders the woods behind the cottage,
terrorizing squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   Keuka is a slim, elegant, glittering ballerina of a lake _ 23
miles long, 180 feet deep and maybe a mile wide at the hips. A
glacier retreating north created it 140 centuries ago. Today, the
lake nestles between rolling hills studded with oaks and maples and
carpeted with lush vineyard. The Finger Lakes region is New York's
wine country. Images of grapes are everywhere _ on municipal signs,
on tourist T-shirts, in restaurant windows.
</P>
<P>
   My family has been on this lake for six decades. In an attack of
spendthriftery, my grandfather shelled out 600 bucks for a sagging,
battered shack that was the scene of my childhood's most glorious
moments _ huge, surging clan gatherings marked by raucous laughter
and odd adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Then my father died, and the place was sold out of the family by
my uncles _ over my vehement objections and my older brother's. We
handled this family dispute in traditional American fashion. We
sued their butts.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the suit was settled and familial harmony restored _
a decade or so later. Now the uncles are dying off at a snappy
rate, and my brother and I have these little cottages, side by
side, a few miles down the road from the scene of our fondest early
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Summer camps are a uniquely northern tradition. Southerners, for
whom winter is less arduous, tend not to have them. Here, though,
for many people, a summer camp represents a crucial psychological
weapon against the ice and snow and the rigid routines of winter
working life.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, an unpretentious summer shack on some lake
was within the reach of most working people in upstate New York.
Now, high real estate prices and towering property taxes are
driving ordinary folks off my lake, at least. They're being bought
out by brain surgeons in Lexus 400s who stomp down the old, shabby
cottages and replace them with lavish mansions of glass and cedar _
monuments to the glories of third-party payment.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, Keuka Lake has been Beemered and Jet-Skied
into full-blown yuppihood, and nobody can do much about it. Labor
Day weekend is summer's last gasp. This year we had the usual mob
of friends and family members joining us for a few days of farewell
to the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, school has started again for my wife, the teacher, and I
have an election to cover.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a few more weekend trips to Keuka _ to throw sheets
over the furniture and blow water out of the pipes as golden leaves
float down on the porch. Then winter will dig its frigid fingers
into our hillside once again. For long, dismal months, the cottages
will sleep beneath a blanket of snow.
</P>
<P>
   While, at least once a day, I'll maintain my sanity by thinking
about next summer there

LABOR IN THE ERA OF EASY LIFTING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Labor Day was a fitting reminder that in this
technological age, heavy lifting isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   A strong back, physical dexterity and a stout heart are still
required for a variety of occupations. But human inventiveness has
created a multitude of machines to ease the burden for most who
toil, at home or at work. This helps to explain why Americans,
young, middle-aged and old, are tubbing up. Nowadays, instead of
relying on work to tire you out, you have to take yourself off to a
gym to raise a healthy sweat.
</P>
<P>
   We should be grateful, therefore, for having to cope in our
daily lives with another in the range of inventions intended to
improve our way of life. This is having to open all manner of
packaged goods. For our benefit or enjoyment, they are wrapped to
protect them against tampering and to give them a long shelf-life.
</P>
<P>
   The often-ingenious designs devised to fend off the undesired
impede, ineluctably, the quest of the customer to get his hands on
the actual items for which good money has been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Consider earphones just purchased, and eagerly brought home to
be connected to the stereo. You can see them, of course, alluring
and promising through their plastic wrapping. However, actually
touching them is another story. It cannot be done by using the mere
hands nature gave us. The two sides of a package, sealed with a
ferocity not to be easily overcome, will not give way no matter how
hard they're tugged.
</P>
<P>
   After several unsuccessful tries, a knife or scissors is
resorted to, and even then it takes concentration to puncture a
hole and begin to expose the earphones to the air. If, by that
time, you are not discouraged by the effort, you are disgusted by
the torn plastic strips heaped on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic in its many variations is no doubt a godsend to this
upgraded lifestyle. In its thinnest guise, it is shrink-wrapped
around much desired merchandise, including compact discs. As with
the earphones, you just have to make up your mind that it will be a
while before you manage to listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only hard goods that require special effort at
extrication. Take the ordinary milk carton, for example, something
we make use of every day.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us can boast of managing to pry open the top of a
carton of milk without tearing the edges? That carton top, properly
unfolded, is supposed to serve as a funnel through which to pour
the contents. But when torn open, it is a sorry excuse for a
funnel.
</P>
<P>
   Each new carton is a fresh challenge, time consuming and
intimidating, because we know how often in the past we have failed
to open it with the edges as straight as when they were sealed
shut. Even the greatest care is seldom rewarded with success, and
we wind up having to look at the mangled spout for as long as the
milk lasts.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences signal us, however subliminally, that we have
yet to master the varieties of benefits in which we are supposed to
revel. Dealing with these challenges is not exactly a moral
equivalent of work. For one thing, it doesn't provide the
satisfaction of real work, the sense of tangible accomplishment,
the feeling of a job forthrightly undertaken and well done.
</P>
<P>
   Our tactile skills are not up to our present availabilities,
much less possibilities yet to be devised. We are told the future
belongs to those with strong minds and lots of self-discipline. Yet
we frequently find ourselves in an environment in which we
comprehend little more than the surface of the technologies that we
are assured empower us.
</P>
<P>
   The new technologies have revolutionized how work is done and
life is lived. In an incessant accompaniment, they also provide a
background hum of low-level frustration, for understanding resides
more on the surface of these ``things.'' As a result, too often we
feel ourselves astray in this new world, a world perhaps brave but
surely inescapable.

`COSTELLO' REHASHES OLD IRISH STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this era of political correctness that has virtually
paralyzed television, let's not forget that the two most abused
ethnicities are the Italians and the Irish. Always have been.
Because television thinks they are fair game and, well, neither
puts up much of a fight about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although both stereotypes will be represented this year,
consider this the Celtic comeback. There will be Irish shows, Irish
families and Irish characters spread across the channels as the
fall programming rolls out. In case you're Irish and think this is
a good thing, think again.
</P>
<P>
   You will get some fair play here and there, but for the most
part you get ``Costello'' (8:30 p.m. Tuesdays, check local
listings), the latest Fox program. Here's a show about Irish
Catholics who actually drink a lot, beat each other up, are
decidedly blue collar, have parents that are emotionless (unless
they're angry) and yell all the time.
</P>
<P>
   (If you're African American and you're thinking at this point,
``Thank God somebody else gets stereotyped this year,'' forget it _
there's an updated version of ``The Jeffersons'' just around the
corner).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, blame part of this broad sweep on Sue Costello, who
apparently was famous enough as a stand-up comic in Boston to get
her own show even though virtually no one west of Brockton, Mass.,
had ever heard of her.
</P>
<P>
   Costello helped create what she says is an autobiographical
show. She plays Sue Murphy (why not just be Sue Costello, since
that's the show title?), a native of South Boston who just happens
to be a bartender in a ``Southie'' neighborhood. She is Irish
Catholic, the daughter of emotionally bankrupt parents, a big
drinker and someone who possesses ``a mouth on her'' that
invariably leads to yelling, arguments and fist-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   If they had just made this show about Elvis Costello, it would
be so much more enjoyable and, without question, more
groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   But no. This is Sue Costello's story and she's sticking to it.
Her Sue Murphy character is troubled. She's 27 and heading for
marriage to her high school sweetheart who has no ambition, so she
decides she wants to go to school and get smart. She's studying
lots of big words and she's gone to see a shrink, which makes her a
freak in the Southie neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are going to flip for Costello. She's short and wiry
and mean as a weasel but also kind of endearing. ``Roseanne'' fans
are certainly the target market as this tough-but-tender approach
gets laid out.
</P>
<P>
   Others won't be able to stomach five minutes of ``Costello.''
It's as if the volume on your TV set got turned up all on its own.
When she opens her mouth its like a band saw cutting through a
particularly knot-filled piece of cherry wood. There may be subtle,
whispered moments in this show but you'd never know it. Mostly
there's yelling and swearing and a general attempt to try to get
away with murder in front of the network censors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if you can get past the voice and the constant
head-rattling yelling, you can find enough pieces to make this a
lovable working-class comedy. The pilot hints at this potential but
every time ``Costello'' looks to be getting ready to strike a true
chord, somebody feels the need to play up either the Irish
stereotypes or the Southie thing, which leads to predictable
cliches and makes for a mediocre pilot.
</P>
<P>
   There is an intangible here: Costello's drive. She somehow
managed to get her own show when scores of more famous stand-up
comics get passed over, so she certainly is motivated. And if this
truly is her life story and she got herself educated (Salem State
College, the University of Massachusetts) in the face of friends
and family who thought she was trying to be ``superior,'' then
maybe it's destiny. Maybe she's the next Roseanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costello'' benefits enormously from the ``King of the Hill''
lead-in. And maybe Hank Hill's down-home attitude _ even if he is a
cartoon _ meshes with Costello's. But there are some serious
question marks for survival here. Nobody knows if ``King of the
Hill'' can be the beachhead Tuesday show that Fox wants it to be,
and viewers are savvy enough to know that there are a lot of
half-hour sitcoms _ and good ones _ on that night, so they may opt
away from the annoying little blond buzz saw and steer toward
something funnier.

ELWAY STILL VERY MUCH AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ All discussion of Monday night's 27-21 Patriots loss to
the Broncos must start and end with the fact that John Elway is
still at the top of the elite NFL quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Elway may be 38, but he dissected New England with his mind and,
yes, his 38-year-old body. That was enough to beat the Patriots,
even with Terrell Davis reduced to a nonfactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elway may be the best that ever played,'' said Patriot
quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who, like his teammates, was not at the
best he ever played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' was how Patriots safety
Willie Clay put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept stopping ourselves,'' were the words of wide receiver
Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to Mile High to play the world champions,'' said
safety Lawyer Milloy, ``you have to have your complete package. We
didn't. We kept making too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimists can look to the fact that New England allowed the
Broncos to jump out to a 17-0 lead and didn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought back,'' said Jefferson. ``There are no quitters on
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Realists, though, can wonder why the Patriots committed a
worrisome number of bonehead plays _ jumping offsides on a punt,
calling two timeouts on the same series in the third quarter and
leaving themselves with a third and 19 and no timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have penalties, they hurt you,'' said Bledsoe, ``but
the penalties we had hurt us more than they normally hurt you. We
had penalties on punts. They were not the kind of penalties where
you lose 5 yards and have to get back those 5 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, said Bledsoe, the Patriots ``could have made it a very
interesting ballgame if we hadn't made those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own performance, ``There were plays early in the game
that I could have made,'' said Bledsoe. ``There were a couple of
times early on that I could have gone in another direction than
where I did.''
</P>
<P>
   What might be equally unsettling to Patriots fans is that it was
the Denver defensive schemes that confused the Patriots _ and not
the Patriots defensive schemes that confused the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great defensive scheme,'' said Bledsoe. ``Their
defensive coordinator (Greg Robinson) and (Carroll) are great
friends. We knew the Broncos would have new things for us that we
weren't ready for; the stuff we were ready for I felt we did a
great job against it. But they gave us a great scheme, arguably the
best defensive scheme in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, for his part, didn't hide his displeasure at Willie
McGinest, who was offsides on a Denver punt in the first half and
was called for roughing Elway in the second half. Denver scored TDs
on both of those revived drives, and the Patriot coach was terse in
his explanation for why McGinest was on the sidelines for a chunk
of the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had enough mistakes and he was cramping up,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, said the coach, ``We needed to play a terrific game
to win and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from it.

ADMIRABLE RESTRAINT ON ESPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN's Jon Miller called Mark McGwire's 61st home run with
simple elegance Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball is gone if it's fair ... and it is ... a home run,
No. 61, ties Roger Maris,'' Miller announced as the Chicago Cubs'
Mike Morgan gave up the historic blast.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waxing ad infinitum, Miller and analyst Joe Morgan
allowed the crowd to do the rest of the talking. The people at
Busch Stadium were on their feet, of course. Many wore red buttons
with ``62'' on them. They were screaming, cheering, deafeningly
appreciative of McGwire's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   No words could adequately capture the crowd's reaction. And
while the networks have milked the home run chase for as much as
they could, when it came time for this homer, less was more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I wanted to do was my job,'' Miller said.
``It's just like the opposing pitchers facing McGwire. We all have
jobs to do, no matter the situation. Mine is to deliver the most
relevant information in as timely a manner as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller knew immediately that McGwire's first-inning smash was
over the fence. The only question was whether it was fair. It was,
and for Miller, that home run replaced Cal Ripken breaking the
consecutive-games record as the biggest feat he has witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing No. 60 was legendary,'' Miller said. ``But No. 61?
That's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was equally impressed. The Hall of Fame second baseman
played in the game in which Hank Aaron tied Babe Ruth's career home
run record. Morgan said he was too caught up in that game to
appreciate Aaron's 714th homer, a feat Morgan considers the
greatest he's witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember nodding my head at Aaron,'' Morgan said. ``But I
could not really celebrate because in reality my team had just
given up a run.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little reserve Monday. ESPN cameras caught Cubs first
baseman Mark Grace giving McGwire a high-five as the slugger
strolled around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it was a tremendous achievement,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire appeared as relieved as he was excited in interviews
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very calm, very relaxed,'' he said. ``It all comes down
to getting a ball to hit. I'm just one swing away from breaking
it.''

   CBS's ``NFL Today'' earned a respectable 3.1 rating Sunday
afternoon in the overnight ratings released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's pregame show earned a 3.7.
</P>
<P>
   CBS recently returned to the NFL after a four-year absence. And
though it came in second place, the solid performance was
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's doubleheader coverage, which included the San Francisco
49ers' overtime victory over the New York Jets, received a slightly
higher rating than NBC's first-game coverage last year.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said Sunday's 1 p.m. game, Steelers-Ravens, pulled a 7.9
rating and 19 share, a 13 percent increase over NBC's 7.0 and 16
share last year.
</P>
<P>
   The network's 4 p.m. game, 49ers-Jets, pulled a 12.4 rating and
a 28 share, an increase of 19 percent from last year's 10.4 rating
and 24 share on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's 1 p.m. game, Packers-Lions, pulled a 11.7 rating and 28
share. One rating point equals 980,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's happy,'' said CBS spokeswoman Leslie Anne Wade.

   Both the handicap division, headed by Skip Away's six
consecutive wins, and the 3-year-olds, with Real Quiet, Victory
Gallop, and Coronado's Quest excelling, have produced plenty of
thrills this year. However, not much of interest has occurred with
the 2-year-olds. The $200,000 Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga often
points out the best 2-year-old in the East, but Saturday's running
of the most prestigious juvenile event at The Spa did not do so, as
Lucky Roberto, a New York-bred off at 9-1 ($20.20 to win), took the
race.
</P>
<P>
   A big loser in the Hopeful was trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who sent
out two promising colts in Tactical Cat, at 2-1, and Time Bandit,
at 5-2; but they could do no better than second and third,
respectively. Another loser was 9-5 favorite Prime Directive, the
winner of the Saratoga Special Aug. 19, who finished fifth in the
Hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Roberto, trained by Frank Alexander and ridden by Robbie
Davis, wore down front-runner Tactical Cat, who was handled by
Jerry Bailey, in the stretch to prevail by a length in the time of
1:234/5 for 7 furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race set up just like I thought it would, and I wasn't
surprised at all that my horse won,'' said Alexander. ``This horse
has been doing very well and he has been doing everything right. I
told Robbie to just let him settle in and then let him do his own
running. I knew the distance was going to help him. He acts like he
can run all day.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some excellent New York-breds, but it is highly
unlikely that Lucky Roberto, a son of Belong to Me, is going to
turn out to be the top juvenile in the East, even though he does
have a nice record of 4-2-1-0 that includes a second behind
Tactical Cat in the Tremont Stakes at Belmont July 4. More will be
known after the running of the $150,000 Belmont Futurity Sept. 20,
contested at a mile. That is where Lucky Roberto is scheduled to
run next, and Lukas expects to enter his top 2-year-old gun, Yes
It's True, who won the $200,000 Sapling Stakes at Monmouth Aug. 22
by more than 7 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly say this is our best one at this point,''
said Lukas after the Sapling.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the best 2-year-old in the East didn't run at Saratoga
at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A quick spin
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the most accomplished 2-year-old to run at
Saratoga this season is the filly Things Change. A daughter of
Stalwart, Things Change captured the $200,000 Spinaway, the filly
version of the Hopeful, by more than 4 lengths under Jose Santos.
Off at 2-1 ($6 to win), Things Change closed strongly, negotiating
the seven panels in 1:244/5.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Linda Rice, who is outstanding with 2-year-olds,
Things Change also took the Adirondack Aug. 17 and has won three of
four starts, her lone loss coming when she finished second in her
debut. The Spinaway gave Rice her first Grade I victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned because I wanted to see her closer to the
lead,'' said Rice. ``Jose never panicked, though; he just let
things unfold. He let her settle in, and when he engaged her, she
responded. This race exhibits that the distances won't bother
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Things Change will be the $400,000 Frizette Stakes, at
a mile and one-16th, on the Breeders' Cup Preview Day card at
Belmont Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough way to return
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lil's Lad, a top Triple Crown contender until he chipped his
left front ankle in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland April 11,
returned to the races at Saratoga Saturday and ran fourth as the
1-2 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what choices were available to trainer
Neil Howard in the condition book, but he picked a bear of a
$50,000 allowance race against older horses for the return of Lil's
Lad. The three veterans who finished ahead of him in the 6
1/2-furlong dash, run in 1:153/5, were, respectively, Pyramid Peak,
Diligence, and Trafalger, all graded stakes winners.

WHY GORBY LOOKS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The midterm election campaign kicks off this week and
businesspeople, at least the businesspeople I know, are extremely
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a couple of weeks ago, the expectation was that
the Democrats would pick up a few seats nationally, cut the GOP's
11-vote majority, possibly even retake the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Such a shift would have set the stage for the Republicans to
retake the White House in 2000, without upsetting the checks and
balances of divided government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some forecasters are expecting a Republican pickup _
perhaps as many as 10 or 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem? Simply that the prospect of unchecked GOP
rule is profoundly unsettling to businessfolk.
</P>
<P>
   For last six years, it has been the Democrats who have been the
stewards of free trade and a growing international economy, while
the Republicans have shown themselves prone to capture by religious
and ideological factions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even Mikhail Gorbachev is looking pretty good. He was
Russia's leader the last time a Republican occupant of the White
House had to make a difficult choice.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush bet on Boris Yeltsin _ but the strategy for Russian
reform has turned out to be a disasterous mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending in American corporations to work side-by-side
with Russia's bureaucratic ministeries to create giant corporations
susceptible to orderly devolution _ which was one logical response
to the end of the 50-year Cold War _ Bush bet that Yeltsin could
preside over an orderly ``big bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev predicted that the attempt to privatize Russia's
assets without simultaneously maintaining a good deal of central
control would lead to massive corruption. And so it has.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that you can pop a macroeconomic system on a highly
developed command economy now has been discredited. The mess in
Russia was brought to you in part by the conservative Heritage
Foundation, whose trademark neckties Yeltsin used to sport.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just Russia that has raised doubts about the wisdom of
the GOP strategic vision. Take the spectacle of Kenneth Starr's
pursuit of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush who first placed Starr on the national stage, by
naming him soliciter general. The spectacle of the the Bush
administration's chief lawyer tormenting Clinton with questions
about the intimate details about his sex life, in the manner of
Torquemada, surely is highly embarrassing to the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, must worry about his place in history _ and Starr has
turned out to be no better bet than Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   However it is the specter of a Republican Congress with a
veto-proof, even filibuster-proof majority that is really causing
big business political strategists to think hard about the future.
And I don't mean just the difference of opinion over how best to
structure future tax cuts _ say, eliminating the marriage penalty
in the personal income tax as opposed to stimulating capital
formation.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative leadership of the Republican Party that came to
power in 1980 was fresh, powerful, and had a few simple good ideas.
The second generation of that leadership is overripe. Populists,
protectionists, religious conservatives in the GOP vie with one
another to promote dubious ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They want to derail fast-track negotiating authority for trade
agreements, end well-established affirmative action programs in
governments and corporations, restrict immigration, tie
anti-abortion and school prayer measures to bills as unrelated as
trade with China and funding for the International Monetary
Authority. Big business is skeptical of it all.
</P>
<P>
   For 75 years, ever since Warren Harding swept into office on the
strength of promise to ``Return to Prosperity,'' America's business
culture has identified its interests with those of the Republican
Party. With the GOP increasingly dominated by ideologues, moralists
and sore losers, a historic reallignment looms.

STRUNK AND WHITE MEET THE CLASS OF '02 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delivering a freshman to college last week, I wasn't surprised
to find that William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White's ``Elements of
Style'' _ relied upon by generations of students since Strunk's
solo version appeared in 1918 _ was still required reading, or at
least required buying, for aspiring writers. But I hadn't realized
that the book was as old as the freshmen are: The third edition,
apparently last revised in 1979, is the one on offer on bookstore
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen is not an advanced age, of course, either for people or
for books. S&AMP;W's reassuringly slim, no-nonsense volume still has
much good advice on the virtues of simplicity, the importance of
parallelism, and other basics of prose style. But its roots go much
further back than the '70s, and in some respects it is showing its
age. For example, S&AMP;W fret a good deal about wordiness and
pomposity, but teachers today seem less concerned with suppressing
bombast than with wringing any sustained writing effort from their
television-addled charges.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the chapter called ``Misused Words and Expressions''
that seems the most dated. Despite their graceful acknowledgment,
elsewhere in the book, that language is a living, changing
organism, S&AMP;W are firm, even dogmatic, in their denunciation of
certain usages _ some of which have been standard English since the
class of '02 babbled its first syllables.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the verb contact, much reviled by usage
authorities in the first half of the century, is still condemned as
``vague and self-important'' by S&AMP;W in 1979. ``Do not contact
anybody,'' they order; ``get in touch with him, or look him up,''
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The adjectives ongoing and offputting are also ruled out of
order, although earlier words formed the same way _ oncoming,
outgoing _ are quite acceptable. But both ongoing and offputting
are standard today, if not equally widespread; ongoing has the
flavor of New World ambition _ shorten those words, sell those
trombones! _ while offputting has a British feel, perhaps because
Americans are less inclined to be merely ``put off'' by the
deficiencies of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;W's strictures, at any rate, are ongoing. Kind of and sort of,
they tell readers, are ``not to be used as a substitute for rather
or something like, but should be used only in a literal sense.''
Thus, when Ado Annie sings ``I only did the kinda things I orta _
sorta,'' the ``Oklahoma'' femme fatale is using kind of correctly
and sort of incorrectly. Feeling sort of confused? Sorry, that's
not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Occupied with these battles, S&AMP;W did not foresee that baby
boomers would refuse to abandon their slang on schedule: ``By the
time this book sees print,'' they declared, ``uptight, ripoff, rap,
dude, vibes, copout, and funky will be the words of yesteryear.''
And so they are, but they also remain in daily use, though some
have new meanings and others have acquired a halo of irony with the
passing years.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something to be said for S&AMP;W's usage pronouncements:
They'll give students an instant history lesson, their very flaws
illuminating how quickly and unpredictably language can change.
Where else would a college freshman learn that you must not
personalize your stationery, since personalize is a vulgar
neologism? What you want to do, according to Strunk &AMP; White, is
``Get up a letterhead.'' They don't say when the expression was
current, but those are unmistakably the words of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only last month I was noting the rapid spread of wax on as a
synonym for talk, chatter _ recently seen not only in the Globe but
in Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal (``Mr. Stone, a
surgical-equipment repairman, waxes on about how well his deck
matches his contemporary home.'') But wax on isn't the only meaning
shift making inroads this summer. There was the discussion on ``The
Connection'' last month in which Tovia Smith, speaking of President
Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones case, observed, ``The
president did seem to couch his answers ... Is there a problem
there?''
</P>
<P>
   Couch, however, needs a prepositional phrase to complete it,
just as wax needs an adjective. He couched his language in vague
terms? in high-flown metaphors? in sports slang? Or is couch coming
to mean simply ``measured'' or ``weighed'' his words?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this innovation from a recent Time magazine:
``Apple's low-cost Imac is a design statement bar none.'' Again,
there's a missing word: ``Imac is the best-designed computer, bar
none'' is the meaning here; bar none means ``excepting none,''
though Time's writer seems to think it's a synonym for
``extraordinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not, I think, examples of one-time gaffes _ those are
easy to find, especially in television and radio, as when Joe
Mantegna, describing Dean Martin, referred to ``some kind of enigma
that he had.'' No, wax and pit, and possibly bar none, are language
in motion, for better or worse. Readers are invited to contribute
other examples of such slippage, whether to celebrate or to mourn;
like it or hate it, it's our language in search of its future self.

NFL QUATERBACKS: OLD GUYS DO IT BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Who is the next great one, the quarterback of
the future?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone keeps asking, in print, on the air. Peyton Manning or
Ryan Leaf? Their contracts went platinum. Their hype went through
the ozone. Now what can we expect?
</P>
<P>
   Probably this: Steve DeBerg as the quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   He is 44 and he is back, because behind center these days, you
can't keep a marginally competent old codger down. More to the
point, you can't keep sensationally talented, lavishly paid,
breathlessly anticipated young quarterbacks up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Steve Young's goal of playing until 40 looks more and
more realistic all the time. He may turn creaky, but he can't turn
into an outrageously expensive young savior. He's been there. He's
done that. It was an overrated experience. But it's valuable now,
at a time when any experience constitutes an advantage, when creaky
trumps callow.
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomethings simply aren't challenging the elders. Brett
Favre and Mark Brunell are young superstars, and Drew Bledsoe has
certified credentials. But their peers aren't altogether reliable.
There doesn't seem to be a Jim McMahon or Phil Simms in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mirer and Heath Shuler, ostensibly sure things, can barely
hand off competently. Trent Dilfer survives in Tampa Bay only
because of his running backs and coach Tony Dungy's exceptional
patience.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them make a case for a new draft-day rule: Never
take a quarterback whose name ends in the letters ``er.'' If Jake
Plummer and Jim Druckenmiller both go belly-up, the rule should
become a commandment.
</P>
<P>
   Those two, however, didn't go in the top six picks of their
draft. Mirer, Shuler and Dilfer all did.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle thought Mirer was going to be the Bledsoe of the Pacific
Northwest. Five years after the Seahawks drafted him, Mirer has
been dumped by two teams, and Seattle is squeezing juice out of
Warren Moon's 41-year-old arm.
</P>
<P>
   Moon is another quarterback of the future, coming to us from
deep in the past. He can still outplay more than half of the
quarterbacks in the league. Where are the players who should be
forcing him out?
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to watch what happens in Buffalo, where
Doug Flutie could become the feel-good story of the season. Exiled
in the Canadian Football League for most of his career, dismissed
as too small for the National Football League, he just might take
over for Rob Johnson, the $25 Million Kid, at some point and fill
our bleak Sundays with wild scrambles and free-lance passes.
</P>
<P>
   He is 35, and his feet should have lost a spark or two. But if
Tom Watson can win a golf tournament at 48, if Tom Candiotti and
Danny Darwin can still find work in the major leagues, if Michael
can make 35 look like prime time, then maybe Flutie is just getting
started.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may not relinquish the job, but he could also turn into
another Scott Mitchell, lured out of obscurity in Florida by
free-agency riches, only to flounder in the Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the Bills' desperation that Johnson converted one
professional start into $25 million. And the Bills are not unique.
Most NFL teams are flailing about, trying to find the next Elway,
Marino, Kelly, Young, etc.
</P>
<P>
   All of these elders went through their own rough times. John
Elway and Steve Young were both, in their early days, seen as
symbols of decline in modern football. Elway manipulated the draft
by refusing to report to Baltimore, and Young signed a
budget-busting $40 million deal with the USFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the headlines,'' Young said. ``Everyone said it was
the end of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   They both persevered, and now, in their late 30s, they seem to
be in no hurry to depart. Elway talked about retirement after the
Super Bowl, but he couldn't let go of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And at 37 last year, he seemed younger and healthier than he had
in his early 30s. He underwent shoulder surgery and came out of it
with raves for the procedure. Not too many years ago, when a knife
went into a football player, his career might have been saved, but
it wasn't enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Modern medicine allows the players to patch themselves up and
jump back into the fray in no time. Modern defensive schemes,
meanwhile, prevent younger players from immediately entrenching
themselves in starting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency may also be impeding the development of the next
generation of quarterbacks. Every year, teams must play musical
chairs with their rosters. Nowhere is that more disruptive than
along the offensive line. A new lineman throws off the rhythm of an
offense, and the quarterback is bound to fall out of synch.
</P>
<P>
   An old-timer can make adjustments more easily (assuming that he
survives the mind-altering collisions that come with disarray in
the trenches). A fledgling, no matter how talented, needs the
harmony of a stable lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters should have one advantage. In the last 10
years, most major colleges have started running pro-style offenses.
Yet the quarterbacks come to the NFL even less prepared than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who thrive tend to retreat after a year or so. Some
of the floundering defies explanation. Jeff Blake seemed to have a
great future in Cincinnati, if anyone can be said to have a great
future in Cincinnati. Now his job is threatened by Neil O'Donnell,
whose continued presence in the NFL illustrates the shallowness of
the quarterbacking pool.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Collins flew high for Carolina in 1996, then came down
like an Icarus in shoulder pads last year. Collins may piece it all
together again. If not, Steve McNair, Elvis Grbac and Kordell
Stewart could stand up for their generation.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the future belongs to the old men, not to the
Heaths, Ryans, Trents or Peytons. This is, for better or worse, the
Year of DeBerg.

SUMMER FUN NOT OVER JUST YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, many travelers realize that September and beyond can be the
ideal time to head for the shore _ Jersey, Cape Cod, Maine, New
Hampshire _ you name it. The weather is fine, the water is still
warm, certainly crowds are fewer and smaller, prices are lower at
resorts and inns, and there are festivals galore.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hampton Beach in New Hampshire waits until Labor
Day is over to hold its biggest and one of its best celebrations,
the annual Seafood Festival. There's no admission to the festival,
it's strictly a pay-as-you-eat affair, and you'll find more than 50
area restaurants cooking under colorful tents along Ocean
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find favorites such as lobster, shrimp, clams _ steamed,
broiled, barbecued, or fried _ as well as non-seafood items. There
will be entertainment from two oceanside stages, a crafts fair,
children's activities, sidewalk sales, fireworks (Sept. 12 at 8
p.m.), and Louie the Lobster and friends will again sky-dive onto
Hampton Beach (Sept. 12 at 6 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Hampton Beach is just about an hour from Boston, so it's easy to
reach, but should you want to stay for the weekend, many lodgings
are offering off-season rates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ocean Boulevard will be closed for the festival, but
free shuttle service is available from area parking lots (regular
parking fees are in effect). Parking meters are in effect in the
area, and, sorry, but pets are not welcome, especially with Ted the
Cat, a Seacoast personality, joining street performers for the
festival. Just bring your appetite and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sept. 12, and 11 a.m. to 6
p.m. on the 13th. For more information, call the Hampton Beach Area
Chamber of Commerce at 603-926-8717.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton Beach is extending its summer season even one week more.
Sept. 18-20 will see the first annual Hampton Beach Seniors
Appreciation Days. The festival is mostly free, and will feature
lots of activities for seniors, including square dancing, bingo,
and antique autos. The Artie Shaw Orchestra will perform in the
legenday Casino Ballroom on Sept. 18 from 7 to 11 p.m. Tickets are
$15.50 a person and can be obtained by calling the Casino at
603-929-4100.
</P>
<P>
   And, should you be interested in the Jersey Shore and happenings
there, give a call to 800-JERSEY-7. The Miss America Pageant will
be held Sept. 15-19 in Atlantic City, and it's now just one of many
post-Labor Day events.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chocolate heaven
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Meridien in Boston will bring back its famed Chocolate
Bar for its 10th season beginning Sept. 12. The buffet features
more than 25 different chocolate desserts from mousses and ice
creams to cakes and the hotel's signature chocolate croissant
pudding. The bar is open every Saturday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
through the end of May. The bar is $16.50 for adults, $7.75 for
those 13 and younger. For reservations, call 617-451-1900, ext.
7125.

Grape fest
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wanted to jump into a barrel and stomp on grapes?
You can, at just one of the happenings at the first grape harvest
festival at Boyden Valley Winery in Cambridge, Vt. The farm, in the
same family for four generations, uses only organically grown fruit
from Vermont farms. From 2 p.m. until dusk on Sept. 12-13, the
winery will celebrate with live music, free winery tours and
tastings, a chance to watch craftspeople at work, and a hayride.
Boyden Valley Winery is near Smugglers' Notch and Mount Mansfield.

<P>
   Worshipers from around the country will gather Saturday (Sept.
12) at a tiny country church in New Hampshire to dedicate the
Sabbath Trail.
</P>
<P>
   It was 150 years ago that pioneer Seventh-day Adventists studied
the Bible together at the church in Washington (N.H.) and
determined that Saturday was the biblical day of worship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabbath Trail will be dedicated at the site where Adventists
first observed the Saturday Sabbath. Forty granite markers with
biblical texts and historical descriptions of people who observed a
seventh-day Sabbath through history line the mile-long loop through
the forest. The day will include a worship service at 9:15 a.m.,
concert at 2 p.m., and dedication at 2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The church is near Route 31 about 10 miles west of Hillsboro.
For information, call Merlin Knowles, pastor of the church, at
603-298-5757. Tourists wishing to visit the church when it is not
open (it is used only from May through October) and read the old
gravestones in the churchyard can get the key at the general store
in town, where they can also pick up a generous hot fudge sundae,
we're told.

A POWERFUL PRESENCE IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire is a very nice fit for the Cardinals.
In less than a season and a half, he has won the hearts of fans in
St. Louis, home to one of baseball's oldest and most traditional
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has been elevated to a status in this city previously
reserved for Hall of Famers Stan Musial, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson,
and soon-to-be Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith. In the long history of
the Cardinals, which goes back to 1892, there never has been
anything like McGwire's impact in so short a time.
</P>
<P>
   How has McGwire stood up under all this attention? Better than
you might think. While Roger Maris was hounded by fans and media in
his run to 61 home runs in 1961, McGwire practically has been on
cruise control in an era where media scrutiny has brought down many
sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who matched Maris with his 61st home run Monday,
undoubtedly is helped by the fact that he has dealt with the
spotlight since he was a rookie for Oakland. That year, 1987, he
hit 49 home runs, a record for a first-year player. He was a part
of four A's teams that won division titles and played in three
World Series, so he is no stranger to media attention. Along the
way he made a lot of friends who appreciate his frankness and
honesty under stressful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and '94, though, McGwire dropped out of sight when
recurrent back injuries limited him to 27 and 47 games,
respectively. When he returned, the A's were only a shadow of the
team that dominated in the late '80s, though he never gave up on
his own ability. McGwire batted .312 in 1996 and was hitting .284
when he was dealt to the Cardinals July 31, 1997 as part of a
rebuilding project in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis fans quickly learned what Oakland fans had known for
years. McGwire is not only talented but also very loyal. If the 24
home runs he hit in only 51 games last season didn't win over the
Cardinal faithful, his signing of a three-year contract worth 28.5
million did. McGwire, who could have gotten more money elsewhere as
a free agent, said that, among other things, he relished the sense
of tradition in St. Louis, something that was missing in Oakland.
He had no idea how much the St. Louis fans would enjoy having him.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of McGwire, the Cardinals are projected to draw
a club-record 3.2 million fans this year, even though they are
under .500 and more than 20 games behind the Houston Astros in the
NL Central. McGwire reportedly has a clause in his contract that
earns him $1 a ticket for every seat sold beyond 2.8 million. Not a
bad return, and a bonus he surely has merited.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making an impact
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Cardinals decided for economic purposes to move
their Hall of Fame out of Busch Stadium. It now shares a facility
with the International Bowling Museum, across the street from the
park. Attendance at the new combined Hall has gone up 40 percent,
according to marketing director James F. Baer, and the reason is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have some of McGwire's things,'' said Baer. ``We'd
love to have home run ball No. 62 on the way to Cooperstown. But
that's up to Mark. We already have a Home Run Chase exhibit. Of
course, the complete Cardinal history is available.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's arrival in St. Louis has helped in other areas.
Downtown hotels and restaurants are thriving. Business has
improved. The Cardinals are at least as popular as the NFL's Rams
and NHL's Blues, both of whom have new downtown stadiums as
attractions. On Sunday, 65,000 watched the Rams in the Trans World
Dome, while 47,000 were at Busch to see the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are saying is that Mark is a really great
Cardinal,'' said Baer. ``It's a real love affair. Sometimes you
find a guy who is breaking records and is a big jerk. Most people
who come here think Mark is really natural and down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's not a guy you see off the field a lot, but we all
know about the time and money he puts into his Foundation for
Abused Children.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire not only knows how to handle the media demands, but he's
also able to defuse controversy like few other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I allow other things to derail me when I come to
the park?,'' said McGwire after hitting his 60th home run Saturday.
After going 0 for 3 Friday night, he did not grant any interviews,
but on Saturday, he spoke after the game for almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather do my normal things, and go about my business like
I am supposed to,'' he said. ``There really isn't much to talk
about prior to a game. If I don't hit a home run, I don't think I
have to come into the interview room to analyze every swing and
every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Aiming to please
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire says his schedule is only slightly different on the
road. Normally, he reserves all interviews for the first day of any
series. (Exceptions are made for national television outlets.) If
he hits a home run, he is always available.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's teammates love having him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day in and day out,'' said pitcher Kent Bottenfield, ``I've
never seen him worry about things. If he goes 0 for 3 or 3 for 3
and hits three line drives for singles, he's just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tip my cap to Sammy. But if you make a perfect pitch to
Sammy he's going to make an out. With Mark, you never know. You
battle to get a hitter behind and get a pitch he can't swing at.
With Sammy you can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that he's out there trying and we
appreciate this. Hitting 50 home runs three years in a row is a
hard thing to do. But sometimes he makes it look so easy that
people on the outside looking in wonder out loud.''

REPEAT OF THE '38 HURRICANE WOULD BE MORE DAMAGING, LESS DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Nobody knew it was coming. The morning of Wednesday,
Sept. 21, 1938, dawned to cloudy skies and a forecast of rain, but
nobody had the slightest clue that New England was about to get
walloped by a hurricane that for decades would rank as the most
damaging storm in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In a few brief hours, some rivers reached record flood levels. A
gust of wind at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton was measured at
186 m.p.h.; for decades it was the second-highest wind speed ever
recorded on this planet. Phone and electric lines _ 20,000 miles of
them _ were knocked down, leaving seven-eighths of New England's
homes without power. Nearly 100 bridges washed out, and almost
9,000 homes were destroyed. An estimated 275 million trees were
snapped or uprooted. And more than 600 people perished in the
blinding wind, rain, and waves.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders abruptly learned the hard way that hurricanes
were not just a tropical concern.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a result, the region was far better prepared during
large hurricanes that followed in the 40s and 50s, and today with
improved satellite systems and computer analysis there would be
enough warning to avert most of the loss of life from a similar
storm. But the vast increase in development along the coast could
make the physical damage even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Although the storm was considered unprecedented in 1938, it
turned out that New England had been hit before, and would be hit
many times again _ though not in the 60 years since with such
ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   Far more people _ an estimated 6,000 _ had died in the famous
Galveston flood of 1900, which was caused by a hurricane that
originated in the same area off the coast of Africa; and the
earthquake and fire that hit San Francisco in 1906 left more
memorable images of destruction and ruin; but nothing short of war
had ever caused as much devastation in this country as the
hurricane of '38. And no storm on record anywhere in the world, up
to that time, had caused so much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most weather forecasters at the time believed that hurricanes
always veered out to sea before they could strike the New England
coast, so even though this storm was being tracked as it moved
rapidly northward _ much faster than most hurricanes do, sometimes
at speeds exceeding 50 m.p.h. _ the official forecast from the
National Weather Bureau, even that morning, made no mention of a
hurricane. It was just a run-of-the-mill storm warning.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Emanuel, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and a specialist in hurricane modelling,
says ``there was one renegade forecaster in Washington who thought
it was going to hit New England, but nobody believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Clark, acting chief of the Weather Bureau at the time,
later explained that the forecasters ``could hardly have given any
greater advance warning, for the tropical storm _ the worst in the
history of the Northeast _ was a freak; it did not follow the usual
pattern...''
</P>
<P>
   Later analysis of historical records made it clear that the
storm was not a freak. In fact, New England had suffered at least
two equally devastating hurricanes: One in 1815, and, earlier, in
1635, soon after the Mayflower colonists arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Governor William Bradford wrote about the storm of 1635, calling
it ``such a mighty storm of wind &AMP; raine, as none living in these
parts, either English or Indeans, ever saw.'' He described it,
quite accurately, as resembling the ``Haurricanes'' of the West
Indies. He wrote that it blew down many hundred thousands of trees,
and that ``the signs and marks of it will remaine this 100 years in
these parts where it was sorest.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It was also described by Increase Mather as ``a most terrible
storm ... whereby we were in as much danger, as I think ever people
were.''
</P>
<P>
   The great hurricane of 1815 was of similar scale, and by then
the region had been substantially built up, so the damage was more
devastating. John Farrar, a professor from the University of
Cambridge, wrote that ``Our orchards and forests exhibited a scene
of desolation, which has never been witnessed before to such an
extent in this country.... A considerable proportion of the large
and beautiful trees in Boston mall (on the common) and in the
public walk near the grainery burying ground, several of which
measured from 8 to 12 feet in circumference, were torn up by the
roots and prostrated.... there seems to be no part of the coast of
New England which escaped its fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Wendell Holmes lived through the 1815 hurricane as a boy
of seven, and later described his recollection of ``a mighty
howling, roaring, banging, and crashing, with much running about
... and battening down of everything that could flap or fly away.''
He wrote a poem about the storm, which included this description:
``Lord! How the ponds and rivers boiled!/ They seemed like bursting
craters,/ And oaks lay scattered on the ground/ As if they were
p'taters.''
</P>
<P>
   Those writings endured, but the passage of time erased the
memory of hurricanes from the consciousness of New Englanders, and
even of meteorologists. They were caught completely unprepared by
the howling wind, driving rain, and merciless surf of that
September day in 1938.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... in 1938.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Things changed fast after that, however. Shaken into action
by the devastation, Congress approved funding for the creation of a
National Hurricane Center, and the US Army Corps of Engineers began
an ambitious program of flood-control projects that went on for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That storm was the first of a series of wake-up calls'' that
brought about the changes, said Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   The dams and storm barriers erected by the Corps of Engineers,
and the enormous improvements in forecasting brought about later by
satellites and better computer models of weather systems, have
combined to make coastal areas far better prepared for the next
raging hurricane that may strike this region. But that's not the
whole story.
</P>
<P>
   For at the same time, the population has grown, and the
development along vulnerable coastal areas has been especially
vigorous. Not only are there far more oceanfront houses, but they
are typically much larger and more expensive than the summer
cottages of earlier times. Researchers Roger Pielke of the National
Center for Climate Research and Christopher Landsea of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have analyzed all the
recorded major storms of this century and calculated how much
property damage might result if the same storms struck today.
</P>
<P>
   By their reckoning, the hurricane of 1938 would now cause more
than $16 billion in damage _ more than all but three other US
storms since 1925, and all but five in this century. (The
recordholder would be an unnamed hurricane that struck Florida in
1926; they figure it would have topped $72 billion in damage today.
Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, ranks second at $33 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 storm's unusually rapid motion was part of the reason
it caused so much damage _ and still would today. There would have
been little time to mount an evacuation, even if one had been
ordered, because the storm was barrelling along at more than 50
m &UR; . &LR; p &UR; . &LR; h &UR; . &LR;  Typically, hurricanes travel 10 to 20 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, it would be a challenge to get people in New
England to take it as seriously'' as people do in the Southeast,
where hurricanes are so much more frequent, said Rutherford Platt,
a University of Massachusetts/Amherst specialist in land use and
planning. ``It was such a fast moving storm ... if you had just 24
hours, it might take some doing to get people to leave their
beachfront communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm's forward speed added to its ferocity in another way
as well: Because hurricanes consist of a swirling mass of winds
circling counterclockwise around a calm center, the winds on the
east side of the hurricane's eye actually are amplified by the
forward motion. While the sustained winds around the eye were
clocked at around 90 m.p.h., when the storm hit, that velocity was
relative to the storm center. Measured on the ground, the winds to
the east roared with the speed of the storm itself added to that,
producing speeds of 140 m.p.h., in places _ and gusts even
stronger. Blue Hill measured sustained winds (averaged over five
minutes) of 121 m &UR; . &LR; p &UR; . &LR; h &UR; . &LR; , along with the record-setting gust of
186 _ and that was far from the storm's peak force, to the west
near the Connecticut river.
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. Brooks, who was director of the Blue Hill Observatory
at the time, wrote later that the hurricane of 1938 had ``rushed
northward to Long Island and New England with the speed of an
express train,'' building wind velocities to 120 m.p.h., on the
eastward part of its path. Striking the coast just at the time of
one of the year's highest tides, the storm's waves ``threw the sea
to such heights that demolition was general along the exposed
coast, and they came so suddenly that hundreds of persons, some of
them at the shore to watch the fine surf, were engulfed and
drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Plants 20 miles inland were killed by the salt spray, Brooks
wrote, and traces of the salt could be found 50 miles from the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island and Connecticut bore the brunt of the storm, but
central Massachusetts took an unusually heavy pounding as well, as
the hurricane maintained its strength well into Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Physical reminders of the 1938 hurricane _ and even of those of
1815 and 1635 _ are still preserved in some of New England's salt
marshes. Thompson Webb III, a professor of geology at Brown
University, has been studying the layers of sand blown across the
dunes and into the salt marshes by great hurricanes. Because sea
level has been rising steadily since the end of the last ice age,
these deposits form a layered sequence in which the history of the
region's storms lies indelibly written. Webb calls his research
``paleotempestology'' _ the study of ancient storms.
</P>
<P>
   Webb says four sand layers can be clearly distinguished in core
samples that span the last four centuries, taken from his principal
research site at Succotash salt marsh in Rhode Island: Those laid
down in 1635, 1815, and 1938 are the thickest; a thinner layer
marks the passage of Hurricane Carol in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to make absolute comparisons of the ferocity of
different storms from such layers, because there are so many
localized differences. But the 1938 hurricane, striking without
warning after several days of soaking rain had swelled the rivers,
was ``almost an ideally bad storm,'' says Emanuel. ``It came
barreling in unannounced on a high tide _ it couldn't have been
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But it still could get worse. Some projections of global warming
suggest that sea level could rise by three feet over the next
century, and if that happens, another such storm ``would be a lot
more devastating,'' Emanuel says. ``That's something to be worried
about.''

CARDINAL SLUGGER HAD A BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew today because it was a lot higher than Monday's, and as
soon as it left my bat I put my hands up,'' said Mark McGwire, who
now has had 448 career opportunities to assess the trajectory of a
home run, but only one chance to watch a record-tying 61st leave
the premises.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon in Busch Stadium, McGwire launched a missile
down the left-field line in the sixth inning. When it left the bat,
it was clearly going to be a matter of fair or foul _ there is
never any uncertainty about the length of a McGwire home run _ and
it wound up hooking foul by 7 or 8 feet, depending on which
``official'' estimate you believe.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he realized that one would wind up on the wrong
side of the foul pole. But he was equally sure that the 1-and-1
pitch he hit Monday off Cubs veteran Mike Morgan in the bottom of
the first would be the historic No. 61 that would tie him with
Roger Maris in only the 143d game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably hooked foul past the pole,'' McGwire said. ``But I
knew at that time, and what a feeling it was; I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit glass in front of the restaurant situated between
the lower and upper decks, just below something known as ``Big Mac
Land'' (a special section sponsored by You-Know-Who) and ricocheted
into the lower stands, where it was recovered by one Mike Davidson,
a 28-year-old St. Louis resident. The official distance estimate
was 430 feet. The actual distance through time and space was
infinite, because now he is linked with Roger Maris, at least until
he gets his first hacks against lefthander Steve Trachsel tonight.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire celebrated his record-tying blast in orderly fashion. As
he started his home run trot, he gave a restrained fist pump. He
was greeted both at first (Mark Grace) and third (Gary Gaetti). And
then, well, let him tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pointed to the man upstairs,'' McGwire recapitulated. ``Then
I pointed to my father. Said, `Happy birthday.' Then I saw my son.
I pointed to my father again, just in case he didn't hear me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he emerged from the dugout for the perfunctory curtain
call, he spied the Maris family seated in box seats to the left of
the Cardinals' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pointed upstairs, pointed to my heart that Roger is with
me,'' McGwire continued. ``Blew him a kiss, pointed upstairs again.
I'd like to point to everybody in the world right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won the game by a 3-2 score, a fact that mattered
a lot more to the losing Cubs, who are embroiled in a tight
wild-card battle with the Mets and Giants, than it did to anyone in
the stands. The only thing that matters around here are the four
times a night that Mark McGwire comes to the plate. As soon as he
is done, fans by the thousands head to the concession stands or
restrooms, or perhaps to call Mom and see if she's been watching.
</P>
<P>
   Now let the record show that in the matter of McGwire vs. Sosa,
as in Sammy, the season tally is 61-58 in favor of the
Brobdingnagian redhead. Sosa was 1 for 5 (an eighth-inning single),
and he struck out three times.
</P>
<P>
   The third K spoke eloquently to the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had Lance Johnson on third base, representing the tying
run, with two away in the ninth. St. Louis manager Tony La Russa
convened a conference at the mound. No one would have criticized
him on any technical basis had he decided to put Sosa on, even
though he represented the tying run. But La Russa elected to have
closer Juan Acevedo pitch to Sosa, and he struck him out on a
1-and-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said he, for one, wasn't surprised La Russa pitched to
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' reasoned the first baseman, ``because he was the
winning run, and if you put him on he has the ability to steal
second. You walk him, and it can turn into a double or triple.
That's the difference between Sammy and Mac. Mac's a base-clogger,
like me.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa was well aware that Sosa could steal a base, but that
wasn't why he pitched to Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it on the bench,'' explained La Russa. ``I
thought about it a lot, and I decided _ and I can't believe I'm
saying this _ that the moment was bigger than the game. In that
situation, you should make (on-deck hitter) Brad Brown beat you.
You've got to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say this, but in that situation those two
guys deserve to be bigger than the game. I yelped the whole second
half of the season about people not pitching to McGwire. What I
said was that if Grace flied out and Johnson stayed on second, we'd
walk him, because then he couldn't steal a base, but if Johnson got
to third (which he did, on Grace's tapper to the box), we'd pitch
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you know how big this is. This is Tony ``The Mad
Manipulator'' La Russa talking. No one loves and respects the daily
ins and outs of the game more. No one sits around thinking up more
ways to tinker with lineups (he routinely bats his pitcher eighth,
remember). But now La Russa feels the weight of history. He told
his pitcher to go after Sosa because there he felt there was
something bigger at stake than he'd ever known in a regular-season
game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire himself feels overcome by cosmic forces. He talked about
fate, and the fact that Monday was _ get this _ his father's 61st
birthday. He talked about his son's plane landing from California
45 minutes before game time and young Matthew arriving at the park
barely in time to see the milestone home run. He talked about the
bond he feels with Maris.
</P>
<P>
   There is one game left on this homestand and McGwire desperately
wants to break the record in front of the St. Louis fans, whose
folksy fervor during the final two months of the 1997 season
persuaded him to sign a long-term contract with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about it since the 50 plateau, but you
think about it and you let it go right out of your mind because you
can't waste brain cells hours on hours thinking about it,'' he
said. ``Now we are one swing away, so we will have to wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain: When it leaves the bat, Mark McGwire
will know.

MURDOCH MOVES CAUSE CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether Rupert Murdoch intends to take over the
world. But he is making it clear that he wants to dominate world
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's European Super League proposal has been resisted, so
he has decided to make a power play, bidding nearly $900 million
for Manchester United PLC, one of the world's most popular clubs.
Murdoch is offering $2.25 sterling for shares that were worth $1.59
sterling last week. He has reached an agreement with the main
shareholder, Martin Edwards, who had attempted to sell Manchester
United for about $30 million in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Murdoch has most bases covered. British government
officials have raised the alarm, but Murdoch is a strong supporter
of prime minister Tony Blair and will not likely confront political
problems. Murdoch could then lead an exodus from the English
Football Association, which was founded in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United already has a huge payroll and an
international cast of players. But Murdoch would be prepared to
increase the stakes, tempting the Baggios and Ronaldos to compete
in England.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Murdoch has been like an annoying intruder into the
exclusive fiefdoms of baseball, ice hockey, and rugby. But he has
respected the balance of power there.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that will continue, though. If Murdoch and
the Media Partners group of Milan gain control of European soccer
from the governing bodies, checks and balances will be diluted.
Since their power is purely electronic media-driven, the
distinctions between entertainment and sport will be blurred
further.
</P>
<P>
   The first sporting principle to fall would be
promotion-relegation. The problem with soccer is that there is no
guarantee that the best, or strongest, team will win.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it is difficult to make a case for a Super League when the
structure for one already is in place, involving any and all teams.
Media Partners hopes to turn the league into an exclusive group,
with money being the sole requirement for entry. Next week, the
European Commission will rule on the antitrust aspects of the case
for the Super League.
</P>
<P>
   As the British fanzine When Saturday Comes noted: ``While laws
governing restraint of trade are intended to ensure as much
competition as possible, the clear aim of the would-be breakaway
clubs is to end any competition, in a purely footballing sense, by
setting up a cartel for clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Euro 2000 kicks off
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Champions du Monde to wrecks in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   France might have been the best while playing at home, cheered
on by an entire nation this summer in the World Cup. But with only
10,000 Icelanders watching Saturday's opener of Euro 2000
qualifying at Laugardalsvollur National Stadium, the French could
only tie the hosts, 1-1, on a 36th-minute Christophe Dugarry goal.
</P>
<P>
   Riki Dadason, who attended college in the United States, took
advantage of an error by goalkeeper Fabian Barthez to score for
Iceland in the 33d minute. Robert Pires set up Yazid Zinedine
Zidane three minutes later, and Dugarry headed in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   France, which is playing a more adventurous 4-3-3 scheme under
new coach Roger Lemerre, dominated the second half and nearly went
ahead when Youri Djorkaeff hit the crossbar. Instead of Aimee
Jacquet's conservative, single-striker attack, France used the
powerful Lilian Laslandes flanked by Dugarry and Pires.
</P>
<P>
   The French were missing Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly, who
were suspended during the World Cup, and Emmanuel Petit. Laslandes
was ineffective and could be replaced by either Stephane Guivarc'h
or David Trezeguet when France visits Russia Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams from each group will qualifying for the finals
in Belgium and the Netherlands, and France remain favorites from
Group 4.

IT WAS NO NEAR-MISS _ NOT EVEN CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOOTBALL HADES, Colo. _ For those of you who collect old
newspapers, go up to the attic and pull out your Globe of Oct. 7,
1997, and take a look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Or read the one from Nov. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Or the one dated Oct. 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Or any one you've got that tells you the tale of the Patriots
playing one of John Elway's Denver Bronco teams _ because nothing
changed last night.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the score in today's newspaper, which reads:
Broncos 27, Patriots 21. Those numbers might lead you to believe
the Patriots came close to beating the Broncos at Mile High Stadium
for the first time since 1968 last night.
</P>
<P>
   They did not.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed the entire night, ominously blowing a 40-yard field
goal that would have tied the game on their first offensive series
and soon falling behind, 17-0. It was a race uphill after that,
and, as everyone kept saying last week, the air is thin in
Colorado. It is especially thin when you're climbing out of a deep
hole you helped dig for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doing the little things the elite teams do, the
Patriots did the deadly things the almost-elite do. They did the
things that get you beat.
</P>
<P>
   --They missed a 40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   --They had another field goal blocked.
</P>
<P>
   --They committed special teams penalties that cost them at least
48 yards of field position, yards that will appear nowhere on the
stat sheet but cost them dearly on the field and, most likely, on
the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   --They committed outrageously stupid penalties, like Willie
McGinest slamming Elway to the ground after a 9-yard completion,
thus turning it into a 19-yard completion. That moved the ball to
the 11 and set up the eventual clinching touchdown by pushing
Denver's lead to 27-14 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --They allowed Denver to convert on third down 53 percent of the
time, including on a third and 7 at the 8 that gave the Broncos
four downs to score from the 1 (they needed only one). They would
have had to settle for a field goal had New England held.
</P>
<P>
   --They burned up all their second-half timeouts with 6:16 left
to play in the third quarter because they couldn't get the right
offensive people on the field or into the right formations. Thus,
when the end came and they scored a late touchdown to bring
themselves within 6 points with just under two minutes to play,
they had to try a desperation onside kick. When they didn't get it,
they were left with no way to stop the clock and possibly squeeze
out one last chance at victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unusual to see these situations that we kept putting
ourselves in,'' Patriot head coach Pete Carroll said. ``We normally
handle them quite well but we didn't tonight. They were able to
capitalize on all of them. We missed opportunities by making too
many mistakes. They didn't make the ones that were critical. We
did.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Patriots played hard, especially on defense,
but they get paid a lot of money to play hard. There are no medals
for trying. Trying is the minimum. Effort is the minimum. You get
no points for effort in the NFL and you shouldn't think you deserve
any. You play hard, just like you work hard, because that's what
you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Patriots also refused to fold several times
after bad things happened and a blowout loomed.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, they were not good enough or smart enough to
beat the defending Super Bowl champions, and they were not truly
even within 6 points of them.
</P>
<P>
   So what does that tell us? Not much except what we already knew,
which is that Elway is unbeaten (now 10-0) against the Patriots and
the only way that streak will be broken is if they square off again
in January, once the playoffs begin, or he decides not to retire as
planned at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they were talking about in the Patriot locker room.
They were talking about the next meeting, about wanting another
shot at the Broncos when everything will be on the line.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good sentiment and it may carry them a ways this season.
Nothing happened last night in Denver to hint that that is not a
strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that losers talk about wanting another shot
because they're the ones who need one. The Broncos were not talking
about wanting another shot at the Patriots, although they probably
wouldn't mind it, considering that they're 11-0 in their last 11
meetings with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nothing changed and nothing happened to indicate
that it would next time, either.

PROTECTING LONGFELLOW HOUSE'S TREASURES

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Most visitors to the Longfellow House don't
clamber up to the cramped servants' quarters in the attic or down
into the cellar's furnace room. But the voluminous history of 250
years is crammed there and elsewhere _ papers, artworks,
furnishings _ and to safeguard that history, the house will close
soon for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations on the Longfellow House, scheduled to begin next
month, include installation of protective and security systems. A
major National Park Service construction effort for 1999, the $1.6
million project is now awaiting funding by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding a visitor through the house on a late summer morning,
curator James Shea did not have to call attention to the lack of
any climate-control system; the stale, musty air did that.
</P>
<P>
   But again and again, whether in the mansion's overstuffed living
quarters or in the cluttered storage areas _ which include back
bedrooms turned into library stacks _ Shea did lament the lack of
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Without those and other renovations, said Shea, the house itself
is at risk. It's the most stately of the Brattle Street ``Tory
Row'' mansions, built in the 1740s and home of the poet Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow from 1843 until his death in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Also in jeopardy are the collections of a family that never
threw anything out. Besides Longfellow's personal library, there
are 635,000 artworks and furnishings; 600,000 letters, journals,
and other documents; and 10,000 19th-century photographs _ with
much still uncataloged.
</P>
<P>
   The vast collection is an extraordinary resource for scholars,
whether their interest is Colonial Cambridge, Georgian
architecture, the American Revolution (the house was General George
Washington's headquarters during the siege of Boston), 19th-century
society, or Longfellow and his esteemed literary circle.
</P>
<P>
   When the project is completed, there will be state-of-the-art
storage systems, and researchers will have something more for
office space than the folding tables pushed together in a corner of
the furnace room. As for the house itself, said Deputy Park Service
Superintendent John Maounis, ``We'll sharpen up the interior, but
maybe it will not look a whole lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the house had a rather extraordinary life before
Longfellow rented rooms there as a young, recently widowed Harvard
professor (he acquired the house as a wedding present from the
Beacon Hill family of his second wife) the aura is all Longfellow.
Washington's association is so much an afterthought that a chair
believed to have been used by the ``Father of Our Country'' is
tucked away.
</P>
<P>
   Longfellow the poet is very much out of fashion these days, the
result, writes literary historian Lawrence Buell, of his being
viewed as too European in comparison with contemporaries (and
friends) Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-fashion older readers, at least, will recall from
childhood a line or two from ``Evangeline,'' ``The Song of
Hiawatha,'' ``The Courtship of Miles Standish,'' ``Paul Revere's
Ride,'' or ``The Wreck of the Hesperus'' _ epic poems that defined
the American experience, if in a European style.
</P>
<P>
   The Longfellow aura is a cosmopolitan one, and nowhere felt more
strongly than in the study off the front entrance hall, where the
dark Victorian furnishings set it off from the lighter Georgian
style of the other rooms. It is the ``castle'' he wrote of in ``The
Children's Hour,'' that beloved poem of childhood, describing his
three daughters _ ``Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra/And Edith
with golden hair'' _ making

</P>
<P>
   They enter my castle wall!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dark, ornately carved bookcases contain Longfellow's collection
of Scandinavian literature (in the original languages, which he
knew) and the collected speeches of his close friend Charles
Sumner, the abolitionist senator. Arranged on two walls are a
crayon likeness of Sumner by Eastman Johnson, and portraits of
Hawthorne and Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the room from the hallway, the visitor finds his eye
drawn immediately to the armchair next to the fireplace. It was
carved from wood of ``the spreading chestnut tree'' celebrated in
his poem ``The Village Blacksmith'' after the tree was cut down
when the street was widened. Cambridge schoolchildren helped fund
the chair and presented it to him on his 72d birthday in 1879.
</P>
<P>
   Longfellow quickly wrote a poem in return:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only your love and your remembrance could
</P>
<P>
   Give life to this dead wood,

   And make these branches, lifeless now so long,
</P>
<P>
   Blossom again in song.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>

   A door from the study leads into the music room, a light and
spacious room opening onto the formal gardens behind the house.
Originally the dining room of the Vassall family for whom the house
was built, it was a wardroom and officers' mess for members of
Washington's staff. It is the room that best preserves the house's
18th-century origins.
</P>
<P>
   The music room is also the scene of the second great tragedy of
Longfellow's life. His first wife had died in childbirth in
Germany. And in 1843, Longfellow married Boston heiress Frances
Appleton, known as Fanny. In the house _ the wedding present _ they
raised five children, two boys, and the three girls of ``The
Children's Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But one afternoon in 1861, while Fanny Longfellow was seated in
the music room, her gown caught fire. She rushed into the study,
where Longfellow wrapped her in a carpet to smother the flames, but
she died of her burns the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The house is remarkably undervisited _ only some 20,000 come a
year _ and may be as much out of fashion as Longfellow's poetry.
But it remains an architectural and cultural treasure.

RUBLE'S FREEFALL BRINGS BACK EMPTY SHELVES, LONG LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MOSCOW _ The shiny new all-terrain vehicle, black with gold
trim and loaded with extras, roared up to the Kuntsevsky
Supermarket in western Moscow and a sharply dressed woman jumped
out, a slim new cellular phone pressed to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``You're sure it's here?'' the woman shouted into the phone as
she sprinted inside, rushing past the lines for meat, butter, and
dog food, to get in line just as the last box of dishwasher
detergent sold out. The woman uttered an oath, stomped off to her
vehicle and sped away, dialing a number on her phone.
</P>
<P>
   This scene epitomized the sudden collapse of Moscow's thriving
consumer economy that has accompanied the ruble's tailspin and the
meltdown of Russia's financial markets. Once again, this is a city
of empty shelves and rapidly climbing prices, lines, hoarding,
black marketeers, bank runs, and panic buying. And the overall
feeling is a sense of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, while Russia was lurching from one
period of pain and crisis to another, the one glimmer of hope that
this country might be ``turning the corner,'' as numerous pundits
have said, was Moscow's gradual transformation from the shoddy
capital of Soviet socialism to a modern city with high-paying jobs,
well-stocked stores, a burgeoning service sector and a confident
new middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, that transformation has been halted. Now,
like millions of their poorer and disenfranchised countrymen in the
outlying regions, Moscow's middle class is at a loss to explain
what is going on as the economy they thrived in disappears. Store
shelves have emptied as Muscovites frantically unload their rubles
and stock up on goods. Imported items, which make up 80 percent of
Moscow's food supply by most estimates, are at a premium, with
stores raising prices several times a day to keep up with the
falling ruble's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bank machines and credit cards, those universal tools of
middle-class consumption, no longer work. Savings have gone up in
smoke, or are trapped in banks that have closed down indefinitely.
The ruble has lost more than two-thirds of its value since Aug. 17
and looks ready to fall much, much more. Many shops and businesses
have closed down. Those that have stayed open are the scene of
quiet mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? How much for that coffee? I don't have that much,''
Svetlana Gavrilova said from the front of the long checkout line at
a trendy supermarket that opened not long ago, across the street
from President Boris N. Yeltsin's city residence. Gavrilova paid
for the goods she had already put on the conveyor belt, and pushed
her half-full cart away with disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this all day,'' said Tatyana Dobrynina, a
cashier at the store. ``People don't know how much things cost.
Everyone wants to stock up while they can. No one can believe it
when I tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Super Siva, a Finnish-run supermarket, could believe
the cost of a package of diapers _ $65. At a nearby music store,
imported compact discs were marked up to more than $40 each. Once
unheard-of luxury items that Moscow residents have learned to love
_ like cat litter, or dog chow _ have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that Moscow has plenty of staple goods to
survive the winter, but buyers are stocking up anyway. Shopping
strategies not seen since the dying days of the Soviet Union _ if
you see a line, stand in it; if it's something you don't need, buy
it anyway _ have made a comeback. So have black market currency
traders, who reappeared on the street after banks stopped giving
out dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd see this again, but here it is,'' said
Marina Volkova, a Moscow schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Certain sites, to be sure, have never been seen here before. It
was intermission at the Lenkom theater the other night, and the
trendy Moscow drama house's upscale guests, as they always do,
reached into their dinner jackets and evening dresses for their
cellular phones. But their conversations were all about one thing _
where to buy what.
</P>
<P>
   If Muscovites were hoping for some encouraging news from their
leaders, they did not get it last night.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's prime minister designate whose
confirmation battle in Parliament has dragged into its second
deadlocked week, had little good news for his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has gone into such a tailspin that there are no
easy ways out,'' Chernomyrdin said on NTV television in a program
where the acting prime minister took phone calls from the public.
``It is painful, bitter, that we have to go back to the way things
were.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting premier, whom lawmakers voted down last Monday and
who is likely to be rejected again in a second vote today, has
proposed an emergency plan that has been panned by economists and
ordinary Russians alike. First Russia would print money, let the
ruble go into a free fall, allow high inflation, and pay off state
debts to workers and industry. Then, after Jan. 1, the country
would return to tight-spending ways, bankrupting insolvent firms,
and forcing everyone to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting whether such a plan could work, no one expects things
to go as Chernomyrdin says now, because in Russia, no one believes
anything politicians say. Or, at the very least, most people are
convinced that bad things that happen to them are part of a
conspiracy to benefit the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen to my deposit _ will it end up on the Canary
Islands like everything else?'' one caller asked, referring to a
move by the Central Bank to transfer people's individual deposits
from commercial banks to the state savings bank. At first, the
government had made it sound as if the transfer would protect
people's savings. But by the end of the week, after it became clear
that depositors would lose much of their money, and would not be
able to access their funds until November, the Central Bank
official who oversaw the scheme stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper highlighted the popular
disgust with the banks on Saturday by printing an anecdote about a
man who enters a Russian bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to open an account in your bank, whom should I speak
to?'' the man asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A psychologist,'' is the teller's answer.

MODERN MARKET FORCES KEY TO FINANCIAL MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It moved through the world's financial markets with the power of
a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   International investors pulled their money out, causing the
collapse of fragile currencies in Southeast Asia, then Russaia,
Eastern Europe and Latin America. One after another, stock markets
followed them down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the West awoke to the seemingly remote crisis that
had been unfolding for more than a year. The mighty Dow Jones
industrial stock index slid 512 points on Monday _ its
second-largest point decline ever. There was talk of a chill in
this country's eight-year economic expansion _ or, worse, a global
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles cascading from Bangkok to Moscow to Caracas are not
the first to hit the world's ``emerging'' economies. In the early
1980s, a debt bomb exploded in Latin America where governments were
unable to repay loans to US banks. But the financial meltdown &UR;  &LR; in
Asia _ and now Russia _ is worse than any ever experienced,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes it is the role played by the modern system of
financial markets. Emerging economies, none more than Asia's,
embraced capitalism and opened their doors to Western
investors &UR;  &LR; and lenders. Total equity &UR;  &LR; investments and loans to 29
emerging countries surged to a peak of $305 billion in 1996. As
financial markets became more fluid and intertwined, big-money
institutions like mutual funds and banks moved billions into
emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   Now that fluidity is the very reason for the dimensions of the
current global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are so small relative to the money these big
institutions can put in,'' said William White, chief economist of
the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, which
acts as a central bank for the world's central banks. The flows of
money, he said, ``cause inflation on the way in, fueling a bubble,
and havoc on the way out as people head for the exits.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability of financial institutions to move money around the
globe with lightning speed is ``the way the modern system tends to
work,'' said Philip &UR;  &LR; Suttle chief international economist for J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The economic turmoil of developing countries &UR;  &LR; has boomeranged on
the industrial world. Troubles in Asia's once up-and-coming
countries have played a big role in weakening Japan's economy, the
world's second-biggest. And Americans and Europeans, who have
sustained huge losses on their activities in Asia, have sparked a
backlash in countries like Malaysia, which slapped on currency
controls and tightened restrictions on foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The sea &UR;  &LR; change in world financial markets is a major
distinction between today's crisis in Asia and the Latin America
debt crisis 15 years ago. Throughout Asia, unprecedented steps were
taken in the early 1990s to liberalize financial markets by
loosening restrictions on foreign investors. More open economies
thrived, as governments had hoped they would. Real estate prices in
countries like Hong Kong surged to new heights. Trade flowed more
freely.
</P>
<P>
   The new investors were not just speculators, the wild men of
Wall Street who place big bets in currency markets. They were also
conservative pension funds, high-risk hedge funds for wealthy
individuals, and New York's most prestigious banks and investment
houses. Even mutual fund investors joined the craze: Between 1995
and 1997, fund assets in emerging markets nearly doubled to $24
billion.
</P>
<P>
   When these investors pulled out, the downturn was breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng index shed
one-quarter of its value in just four days last October. The volume
of trading in Thailand's stock market plunged from $1 billion a day
at its peak to under $20 million now. Stock markets in Indonesia
and Malaysia lost half of their value over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Premier companies were flattened. Matahari, Indonesia's biggest
department store, was ``over-owned'' by investors, said Edward
Bozaan, president of Waterford Partners, a New York firm that
invests in troubled emerging markets. During rioting in the country
early this year, stores burned, pushing Matahari's stock value to a
penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, as a result, should be able to cash out of Matahari's
stock ``sometime into the next century,'' Bozaan said.
</P>
<P>
   The boom _ and bust _ in Asian stock markets parallels the flood
_ and withdrawal _ of international capital into and out of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years, the amount of new equity and loans &UR;  &LR; flowing
into five emerging countries in Asia _ South Korea, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines _ more than doubled to $97
billion in 1996, according to the Institute of International
Finance in Washington, which tracks lending and investments in
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries' stock markets doubled in the final three months
of 1994. That attracted more investors, some of whom had portfolios
bigger than the capitalization of a single Asian country's stock
market. Share prices shot up further.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse on July 2, 1997, of Thailand's currency, the baht,
triggered an exodus of $12 billion in capital from Asia's
developing economies in 1997. Currencies plunged. The ensuing
capital flight and plunging stock markets sparked another round of
currency devaluations in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As money fled Asia, some investors moved to new opportunities _
in Russia. The value of its fledgling stock market soared to
ludicrous heights. As Russia's economy unraveled, stocks lost most
of their value. The investment fund of international speculator,
George Soros, &UR;  &LR; sacrificed $2 billion in Russia, mostly in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if money was bouncing from place to place,''
said J.P. Morgan's Suttle. ``When Asia came under pressure that
money flowed to other parts of the world, Russia and also Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The West was not spared. Stocks of European companies and banks,
heavy investors in Russia and Asia, were battered. Resource-rich
countries such as Venezuela and Canada, hit by plunging commodities
prices, are struggling to shore up their currencies in the
aftermath of the Asian meltdown.

 TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... Asian meltdown.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These are the risks people don't anticipate when putting 10
percent of their (401)k in an emerging markets fund,'' said Jamie
Coleman, a senior foreign exchange analyst for Thomson Global
Markets, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Western economists and investment specialists say,
Asian markets were simply unprepared to handle the ``hot money''
pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets typically are marked by weak regulation and bad
accounting practices that conceal a company's true financial
condition, making it difficult for outside investors to accurately
assess risk. In Malaysia, for example, there are no credible rating
agencies, said Phil Wellons, deputy director of the Program on
International Financial Systems at the Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, these stock markets had a sort of casino
quality to them with taxi drivers taking an hour off to watch the
screen in the broker's office or housewives going in,'' Wellons
said. ``What I find appalling is that (foreign) investors knew
this.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the near-breakdown of financial markets has created a
backlash from some Asian leaders threatening to reverse free-market
reforms put in place over a decade. ``The free market has failed
and failed disastrously,'' Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said last week when he announced capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Hong Kong, departing from their trademark
free-market philosophy, recently used the city-state's &UR;  &LR; ample
foreign reserves to intervene in markets and outfox speculators
ravaging their dollar. The government ``had to do something,'' said
David Tsui, director of the US office for Hong Kong's trade
ministry, defending the moves. ``Once these speculators have
departed, we will move out of this in an orderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As stock and currency markets shook, an earthquake rumbled under
the surface. Commercial banks in Europe, Japan and, to a lesser
degree, in the United States hold billions in bad loans to troubled
Asian companies and Russian enterprises. These loans are an even
greater, if less visible, threat than the plunging markets.
</P>
<P>
   As banks stepped up their Asian lending during the early 1990s,
they were hailed as essential to the region's transformation to
free markets. Over the past year, it has become evident to
international banking specialists they repeated the mistake made in
Latin America in the 1970s when US banks lent more than $200
billion to governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund estimates, conservatively, that
problem loans in emerging Asian economies total $266 billion.
Japanese banks, according to some estimates, provided nearly
one-third of the loans that funded the business and building boom
of its neighbors. Lending to emerging Asian economies is a large
chunk of the astounding $1 trillion in bad loans piling up in
Japan's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were eager to make loans to Asia's emerging markets
because governments there encouraged it to fuel economic growth. In
Korea, banks borrowed money from foreign banks and in turn lent to
domestic companies. Loans were not always wise. ``We now have steel
mills financed with 90-day loans,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from magnitude, the Asian debt crisis differs from Latin
America's troubles in another significant way &UR;  &LR; _ which could slow
resolution of the latest crisis. Latin America's borrowers were
primarily governments. A consortium of banks and US government
officials was formed to meet with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina to
hammer out overarching repayment schedules with each.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's debt may be much more difficult to clean up,
international economists said, because it consists of millions of
loans to private enterprises or banks _ making it impossible to
reach an overall solution.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in currencies worsened a debt crisis already in the
works in Asian economies that were slowing down. When currencies
fell, companies could not repay US-dollar or yen-denominated loans
in their own countries' currency. Banks halted their lending,
wreaking further havoc on fragile markets.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, for example, had borrowed heavily from Western and
Japanese banks in the two years running up to its currency crisis.
The rapid pullout by international banks accelerated a plunge in
the won late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of debt problems has been slow in Korea _ &UR;  &LR; a
harbinger of what other countries face. The auction of Korea's
third-largest auto maker, Kia, collapsed last week amid bickering
among creditors, including Ford Motor and Hyundai, seeking to buy
Kia.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons I take away from this is that developing
sophisticated markets takes time,'' said Donald Mathieson, chief of
the emerging markets research group at the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets were the latest to demonstrate their
inability to withstand the international money &UR;  &LR; invasion _ and
subsequent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest government bonds, known as GKOs, were a magnet for
Russian banks seeking better returns than could be earned from
low-yielding US Treasury securities _ GKO yields once topped 200
percent. Hedge funds and foreign banks from Europe, the United
States and South Korea, followed them in and played the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term GKOs were ultimately a powerful destabilizing
force in Russian financial markets. &UR;  &LR; As economic reforms stalled
and the ruble slid, political and financial instability spread.
Desperate to do something, the government, unable to repay the
GKOs, simultaneously devalued its currency and defaulted on $40
billion in ruble-denominated debt on Aug. 17. Financial
institutions were left holding paper worth a fraction of what they
paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has grown of the intricate ties between the West's
financial giants and the players in Russia. Citicorp, which was
hurt by Latin America's woes in the 1980s, said last week it would
lose about $200 million &UR;  &LR; on customers who invested in Russia and
were caught short when the ruble fell.
</P>
<P>
   For emerging economies, international economists and bank
regulators see one way out: A cleanup of the bad loans so that
banks can again lend money for business expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial
Group Inc., it is unclear who will lead the effort, ``There's no
organization like the Fed or the (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.)
that can parachute in and isolate the problem,'' Perna said.
``That's part of the problem.''

HAD ENOUGH OF IRRITAINMENT? TUNE IN TO JARGON WATCH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ``Irritainment: Entertainment and media spectacles that are
annoying, but you find yourself unable to stop watching them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Assmosis: The process by which some people seem to absorb
success and advancement by kissing up to the boss rather than
working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Umfriend: A sexual relation of dubious standing. ``This is
Dale, my ... um ... friend ...''
</P>
<P>
   Each month Gareth Branwyn's Jargon Watch column in Wired
magazine offers a handful of new slang culled from a multitude of
submissions by jargonauts to jargon(at)wired.com. The September
issue has six terms, the best of which may be ``brain stain,''
defined as, ``inept, often irrelevant comments left by supervisors
on copies of memos and other documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The pick of Branwyn's previous columns can be found in a little
book _ and it's truly little, just 3 1/2-by-5 inches _ called
``Jargon Watch.'' There's a funny, useful word on every page. Many
entries have a Dilbertian edge because they emerge from the pods
(or ``cube farms'' or ``veal pens'') of disgruntled workers. For
example there's ``uninstalled,'' yet another euphemism for being
fired; ``interrupt-driven,'' used to describe someone who responds
to a series of interruptions rather than set work goals; ``voice
jail system,'' for a voice mail system that's too lengthy and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the terms in ``Jargon Watch'' are by now pretty well
entrenched in the language. Facetime. Going postal. Stalkerazzi.
Road Rage. Tract mansion. Starter marriage. Begathon. But there are
many more clever inventions that deserve wider use.
``Permalancer.'' A permanent freelancer. ``YODA: Young, Opiniated,
Directionless Artiste.'' And one of my favorites (I wonder why?),
``stress puppy: A person who seems to thrive on being stressed out
and whiny.''
</P>
<P>
   A great many of the entries have, of course, emerged from
computer culture. ``Webbelganger,'' a person who comes up in an
on-line search but is not the person you're looking for. ``Eliza
Effect,'' the tendency to believe that a computer has personality
and intelligence. ``Ohnosecond,'' the fraction of time in which you
realize you've made a big mistake. ``Kubris: An extreme form of
arrogance found in multimedia auteurs who think they're Stanley
Kubrik.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Kubris, I also liked ``multimediocrity,'' defined
as, ``Boring, poorly-done CD-ROMS, multimedia Web sites, and the
like.'' It also could be used to describe certain persons in the
wonderful world of irritainment: ``Kathie Lee Gifford is a
multimediocrity.'' Although it can't be said she's covered with
``loser dust,'' a bit of Hollywood slang defined as ``the opposite
of fairy dust.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more favorites (of many):
</P>
<P>
   ``Generica.'' Parts of the American landscape (strip malls,
hotel chains, prefab housing) that are exactly the same no matter
where you go.
</P>
<P>
   ``SITCOMs.'' Single income, two children, oppressive mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circling the drain.'' Medical slang for someone near death who
refuses to give up, used in other contexts, e.g., ``This idea has
been circling the drain for weeks ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bother.'' Coffeehouse term for decaf with skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   Branwyn is always on the lookout for new slang. I may have found
a couple of possibilities the other day, in a British newspaper.
The first was ``Lycra lout,'' used to describe a reckless bicyclist
and doubtless inspired by the long-established ``lager lout,''
which is self-explanatory. The second term was ``poke,'' the street
name for Viagra. It's self-explanatory too, I suppose.

LANDINGS   ON WATER EXTREMELY RARE, RISKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is part of virtually every pre-flight safety message: ``In
the unlikely event of a water landing, your seat cushion is
designed to float.''
</P>
<P>
   On overseas flights, the water precautions seem even more
comforting _ flight attendants tell you that life vests are under
your seat and laminated safety cards have pictures of passengers
floating in large circular life rafts.
</P>
<P>
   What neither the smiling flight attendant nor the safety card
will tell you is that ditchings, or water landings, are an act of
supreme desperation and any slim chance of survival depends on an
extraordinary confluence of luck and skill.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots admit they have no way of training for a water landing,
other than to review the steps called for in their flight
operations manual. And most of those instructions detail procedures
to prepare the cabin crew and notify the Coast Guard of the
aircraft's exact location, pilots say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not something that you can train for,'' says Robert
Flocke, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, the union
that represents most commercial airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the crew of Swissair Flight 111, which crashed in the
Atlantic on Wednesday while trying to land at Halifax, Nova Scotia,
was attempting to ditch is unknown. Passengers, however, had put on
life vests and pilot Urs Zimmermann had dumped fuel _ perhaps in an
effort to make the aircraft more buoyant in the event of a water
landing. The accident, however, certainly illustrates how
unforgiving a surface water can be.
</P>
<P>
   One item in the pre-flight safety message that is beyond debate
is that water landings are very rare indeed. Consider that the
National Transportation Safety Board database _ which covers the
31-year history of the agency _ has no entry of a US commercial
airliner ditching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to find any precedents on which to rely,''
says Stuart Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, a
Virginia-based organization whose members include airline
executives and airplane manufacturers. ``And aircraft are not
designed, in the end, to land on water, although it is assumed they
will float.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bradley, a spokeswoman for Boeing, the world's largest
commercial airline manufacturer, says the company uses a NASA study
from the 1960s to determine ditching characteristics of an
airplane. Bradley says that although the study is 30 years old, the
appearance of jet aircraft has not changed much in that time.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also uses computer modeling to follow Federal Aviation
Administration regulations regarding buoyancy in ditching.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulations are not specific other than that a plane
should be buoyant enough to allow all passengers time to evacuate.
The regulations add that models can be used to determine ditching
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations and all the engineering calculations make one
very large assumption: that the fuselage will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attempt of a pilot trying to land an airliner in
water occurred off the Indian Ocean islands of Comoros. A hijacked
Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 _ its fuel exhausted _ was coming in
for a daylight landing on relatively calm seas when a wing-tip
dipped, caught the water, and the plane cart-wheeled and broke into
several pieces. Of the 175 people on board, only 52 survived.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, in May 1970, a Dutch Antilles Airlines DC-9
ditched in the water off St. Croix after it ran out of fuel. That
crash had a much higher survival rate _ only 20 of the 63 people on
board died.
</P>
<P>
   The downing of Swissair Flight 111, which killed all 229 on
board, is only the most recent of crashes into water. Some of those
crashes have only served to spur debate about the best way to ditch
an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1978, a National Airlines Boeing 727 headed for
Pensacola, Fla., crashed in Escambia Bay, some 31/2 miles short of
the runway. The landing gear was down. Three passengers drowned in
the accident; 49 others, and all six crew, survived.
</P>
<P>
   While most manufacturers and airlines mandate that ditching be
done with gear up, some pilots point to Escambia Bay as a reason
why the gear should be down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some interesting debate among pilots as to whether
gear up or down is better for ditching,'' said John J. Goglia, a
member of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, ditching cannot be practiced and airline
pilots interviewed say it is not part of training on simulators.
For the most part, the only water training pilots and flight
attendants receive is in dealing with the life rafts _ which are
stored in the ceiling of overseas aircraft _ and use of survival
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, for one, wonders why the rafts are even there. ``I'm
never going to advocate doing away with life jackets or a slide
that converts to a raft, but you have to question why those rafts
are in the ceiling. They have never been used in millions and
millions of flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what is most frightening about water landings is they
assume a best case scenario _ daylight, calm seas, and lots of time
to prepare. Consider that under recent rule changes, most
twin-engine aircraft that now fly across the Atlantic have to be
within 180 minutes of an airfield. It took about 20 minutes for
Flight 111, a three-engine MD-11, to go from a normal
trans-Atlantic flight to a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ditching is a very difficult thing to do well in the daytime,
when you have to judge where you are in relation to the water and
if there are big swells, you might try to come down on the back
side of one,'' said Eugene Covert, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor emeritus of aeronautics. ``At night,
everything is more difficult because you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say in attempting to ditch an airplane the preferred
method is to keep the engines running, approach the water at speeds
of around 150 miles per hour, with the nose of the plane slightly
higher than normal and have the tail strike first. With luck, the
plane would act somewhat like a skipping stone before settling
gently into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get the plane to stall, at 100 miles per hour, a few
feet above the ocean and pancake in may seem like a more reasonable
approach because the lower airspeed would probably reduce stress on
the fuselage. But it could result in a case like the Ethiopian
airliner, and a wingtip could catch a wave with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have great confidence in doing something like this?
No,'' said one veteran airline pilot. ``It is new ground _ and that
is a bad word _ for everyone. Nobody has done it. We would do what
we are trained to do and what our airmanship skills provide. An
airliner is a marvelous piece of equipment, but it is not designed
to land in water.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest an US commercial jet ever came to ditching was in
May 1983, when an Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-1011 took off from
Miami for Nassau with 162 people on board. A half hour into the
flight, the pilot, Richard Boddy, was guiding the jumbo jet on a
descent through 15,000 feet when the tail engine lost oil pressure
and was shut down. Boddy told passengers he needed to return to
Miami, turned around, and climbed to 16,000 feet when one
under-wing engine flamed out. Three minutes later the only
remaining engine shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said they became very alarmed when the cockpit crew
called all the flight attendants into the cockpit. ``That made me
realize that there was something rotten in Denmark,'' passenger
Sandy Dix said at that time.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane passed through 10,000 feet, the flight crew
announced ``ditching is imminent.'' Passengers had trouble finding
and putting on life vests, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane flew silently closer to the Atlantic, sobs and
prayers were heard throughout the cabin. At about 2,800 feet, Boddy
managed to restart the tail engine and the plane limped back to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' Dix said at the time, ``like God turned that one
flaming engine back on for a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   As those passengers still brave enough to fly waited for a new
aircraft to take them to Nassau, the airline provided them with
food and drinks that May morning. They consumed a total of 384
one-shot bottles.

COMMUNITY LEFT GRIEVING BY DEATHS OF SIX CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ Khoua Her wore a traditional silk gown, her
black hair flowing over its blood-red hues, as she dialed 911 to
report that she had just killed her three sons and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   To her elegant apparel, the 24-year-old woman, a mother since
she was 13, added a gruesome accessory, a length of cord wrapped
around her own neck, police sources said. The children had already
been strangled to death.
</P>
<P>
   By outfitting herself with the cord and the ceremonial garb more
normally reserved for weddings and New Year's festivities, Her sent
a message to the immigrant Hmong community, which was left groping
Saturdayto understand Thursday night's sextuple homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people, when they die, they have to wear their best. She
must have put it on to take her to God,'' said Robert Thou, a
relative of Her's, standing on a soccer field next to the housing
project where Her and her children lived.
</P>
<P>
   Her survived _ a police source said she apparently passed out
while trying to tighten the cord _ and was being held under guard
Saturday at nearby Regions Hospital. Her injuries were described as
not life-threatening. She has not been charged in the killings, but
a judge allowed authorities to hold her through Tuesday while the
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator said Saturday that Her would probably be
charged with six counts of second-degree murder at an arraignment
Tuesday afternoon in the deaths of the six children, whose last
name was Hang: boys Kouaeai, 11; Samson, two weeks shy of his 10th
birthday; and 7-year-old Tang Lung; and daughters Nali, 9; Aee, 6;
and Tung Ke, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to release the tape of the 911 call or discuss
the case in detail before the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the police supervisor who took the 911 call said in an
interview with the Globe Saturday that Her first said only that she
needed help, and initially he thought she was being threatened by
someone in the house. Then, ``she blurted out, `Suicide,''' said
Sergeant Tim McCarty. ``Five or six minutes into the call, she said
she didn't know why she killed her children.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, a rescue team was on its way, and Her added another
piece to the puzzle. ``She said she tried to hang herself,''
McCarty said. Her ``wasn't too lucid'' when she called, he added.
</P>
<P>
   No motive has been given for the killings, but police described
a combustible relationship between Her and her estranged
29-year-old husband, Kong ``Tou'' Hang. The couple had been brought
together by Hang's mother in an arranged marriage. They wed in a
refugee camp in Thailand when Her was just 13.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the two seemed happy at first but in recent years
had grown bitter and apart. One neighbor said they had received a
``Hmong divorce,'' but apparently had not dissolved the marriage in
a US court.
</P>
<P>
   Police records show officers were called to the home 17 times
since February 1996, and both husband and wife traded accusations
of abuse. One case in June 1997 included an allegation that she
threatened Hang with a shotgun; she said it was in self-defense.
Later, she received a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no sympathy for him, only for the children,'' said a
St. Paul police official close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no reports of abuse involving the children, who
ranged in age from 5 to 11, all of whom the Ramsey County medical
examiner said had been killed by ``ligature strangulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies, still warm when authorities arrived in response to
the 911 call, were found scattered through the home.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, just 20 feet from the door of Unit G at 1541
Timberlake Road, six boys climbed on one of roughly a half-dozen
playground sets that punctuate the wide green spaces in the neat
1950s McDonough Homes housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the three-bedroom, tan stucco townhouse where the
children died, mourners had left a small memorial. Six teddy bears
of various sizes _ the largest a foot-and-a-half tall and the
smallest just 3 inches, white with a tiny bowtie _ stood silent
guard. Above them a sign read: ``May God be with you all. Peace.''
Eight bouquets surrounded the bears, and someone had placed a
children's magazine and Christian comic books alongside.
</P>
<P>
   The door to the unit was sealed with police tape. The only
movement apparent was made by wind-blown curtains in an open
upstairs window.
</P>
<P>
   The boys on the jungle gym steered clear of the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mom put bad medicine in their food, and they died,''
said a boy who identified himself as Chi, a 7-year-old who had
played with Her's children.
</P>
<P>
   On the nearby soccer field, Thou, a cousin of Her's by marriage,
stood watching a soccer tournament involving 20 teams, mostly from
the Twin Cities' 50,000-strong Hmong community. Nearby, men played
a Hmong game reminiscent of bowling, launching spinning tops into
the air to knock down stationary tops some 30 yards away. A flea
market ringed the playing fields, and men sold roasted meat while
women set up racks of colorful clothes to catch the eye of Hmong
soccer moms.
</P>
<P>
   But the festive atmosphere was a facade, as conversations kept
coming back to the six children killed not 48 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Thou said he worked with Her at a computer disk-manufacturing
plant and described his distant relation as slim and pretty, ``a
very strong Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed like a happy person,'' he said. He added that she
told him Tang stayed home with the children while she worked and
that was fine with her.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging her 2 1/2-year-old son close, Julie Yang stood nearby
shaking her head. ``We are all shocked,'' Yang said. ``To me, I
think she was out of control and wanted to take her children with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the headquarters of the Lao Community of
Minnesota Inc., men sat at a table making plans for the New Year's
celebration in November. By coincidence, they were all members of
the Her family, though none said they were close relatives of Khoua
Her or the children. Still, their eyes were ringed red, and there
was little talk of the big party planned with the ``Silent Thunder
Band.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to say. It is too hard,'' said John Her.
</P>
<P>
   Others struggled to make sense of the tragedy. Some who have
studied infanticide said that by apparently trying to kill herself
as well, Her should be viewed at least to some small degree as a
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might well be a case of a woman saying, `I can't protect
you, but I can't leave you behind,''' said Richard Gelles, who
holds the Joanne and Raymond Welsh chair in child welfare and
family violence at the University of Pennsylvania.

 MASS x VELOCITY PLUS OTHER STUFF EQUALS: `IT'S GONE!'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good thing baseball home run kings Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa don't have to run the equations before they decide whether to
swing for the fences, or Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs would
have faced no threat.
</P>
<P>
   Considered as a matter of physics and physiology, using a bat to
smack a fast-moving baseball over a stadium fence is a stunningly
complicated feat to calculate and achieve even once _ much less
with the regularity that the St. Louis Cardinals' McGwire and
Chicago Cubs' Sosa have been doing it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a tremendous feat to hit a ball 400 feet,'' says
physics professor Robert K. Adair of Yale University, who has
written a book on the subject, called `The Physics of Baseball.'
``It requires a phenomenal concentration of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular shibboleth of sports journalism holds that no task in
sport is harder than hitting a baseball with a bat. Back in the
late 1980s, the late A. Bartlett Giamatti, a Yale president and
baseball nut who went on to be National League president and then
baseball commissioner after leaving New Haven, encouraged Adair to
bring his loves of physics and baseball to bear on explaining just
how it is done.
</P>
<P>
   Through research that included developing a complex equation
explaining the physics of a home run, Adair showed that to drive a
fastball coming at you at 90 m.p.h. over a big-league stadium fence
requires swinging a bat at better than 70 m.p.h. McGwire and Sosa,
Adair thinks, probably often exceed 80 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but given that a &UR;  &LR; fastball reaches the plate in
less than half a second, a batter must decide in a fifth of a
second after the ball's release whether to swing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Mis-timing his swing by 1/100th of a second will mean the
difference between a foul ball and a four-bagger. A 1/200th second
difference will determine whether the ball travels to right,
center, or left field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not for nothing did legendary Boston Braves pitcher
Warren Spahn once observe: ``Hitting is timing. Pitching is
upsetting timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his research, Adair found that during the 1/1,000th of a
second that a slugger like McGwire or Sosa is actually making
contact with the ball for a home run, he is exerting something like
8,000 pounds of force on it _ the equivalent of an elephant's
stepping on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 1/20th of a second before a slugger makes contact,
Adair calculated, his body is generating an astounding 10
horsepower of energy _ 70 times as much as a manual laborer might
exert during a workday _ virtually all of it concentrated in
whipping the bat around.
</P>
<P>
   The basic equation involved is that mass times velocity _ the
weight and speed of the bat _ determines the force with which the
ball is hit, and the faster the ball is pitched, the faster and
therefore farther it's hit.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows there is no such thing as the ideal-sized bat.
Babe Ruth was known to use 44- and even 47-ounce bats for his
legendary drives. McGwire uses a 36-ounce bat. Sosa and the Seattle
Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. use 31-ounce models.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there an ideal-sized batter or ideal hitting technique.
While McGwire and Sosa have been going head-to-head in the home run
race all summer, they are remarkably different physical specimens,
McGwire 250 well-muscled pounds on a 6-foot-5-inch frame, Sosa just
200 pounds and 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Where McGwire uses fierce power in his swing and an unorthodox
one-handed follow-through, Cubs batting coach Jeff Pentland told
reporters earlier this year that Sosa ``does it in a different way,
with quickness and sharpness. He's certainly a well-built guy, but
he's not a physical presence'' like McGwire or some of the other
big sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   And as hard as both McGwire and Sosa swing, much of their effort
goes for naught. Adair found that as a general rule, only half the
energy in the swing is transmitted to the ball, the rest lost to
wind resistance or absorbed by the bat and the batter's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of the energy that does meet the ball, one-third is lost to
distorting and heating the ball through friction (a well-hit ball
will get 1 degree Farenheit warmer from the impact, and its
diameter will briefly shrink to half its normal size).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only one-third of the force a slugger like McGwire
is developing at the plate goes into the ball's ultimate flight _
and still he often sends it 450 or 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone possibly decide in 2/10ths of a second, about the
minimum time the average person can sensibly react to anything,
whether to swing at a pitch?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound. Adair said he thinks batters work on ``pattern
recognition,'' seeing in the windup and delivery of pitchers they
face over and over again clues that tell them what pitch is coming.
(But a pitcher who tips off the hitter that way isn't going to last
long). Some hitters claim they can pick up the rotation of the ball
in flight and thus know what kind of pitch it is.
</P>
<P>
   Others claim the best batters make an educated guess about
what's coming next. Cardinals' hitting coach Dave Parker has been
quoted as saying McGwire correctly guesses what kind of
pitch &UR;  &LR; he'll be seeing 85 percent of the time _ often seeming to
sense before it &UR;  &LR; before it is thrown the one hittable pitch he
might get in an at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look to either McGwire or Sosa for a detailed explanation
of what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talk technical baseball,'' McGwire told the Sporting
News' Steven Marantz this summer. ``There are things the media
don't need to know. There are things my teammates don't know about.
I just keep it to myself...Someday, when I'm a coach, I'll talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, a formerly erratic slugger who last year set the Cubs team
record for strikeouts with 174, says he has learned to be more
choosy. ``I have to go out and try to make contact,'' he said
recently. ``Don't swing at so many bad pitches, because that was my
problem before. So that's what I'm doing right now: I'm more
patient, I'm more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   However much science can explain about what happens, as McGuire
and Sosa movedit remains clear to Adair and others that a big part
of it is innate talent, endlessly honed instinct, and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when two nuclear physicists from the University of
California at Berkeley developed what they called a ``formula for
the perfect swing'' based in part on films of the Red Sox' Ted
Williams, the last slugger to hit over .400 in a season, Will Clark
brought them back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a perfect swing,'' said the Texas
first baseman, who's hit quite a few homers in his career.
``There's 9,000 different theories on how to hit a baseball. The
big thing about it is just hitting the darned thing.''

THE VARIABLES IN THE EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic equation that explains whether a given hit will be a
home run is that of momentum, defined as mass (bat size), times
velocity (speed of the swing plus the speed of the ball). But those
are only two of the perhaps countless variables involved.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem counterintuitive, but a fast ball is more likely to
be swatted for a home run than a slower-moving curve, knuckleball,
or slider. The reason is a ball coming in at 90 m.p.h., has more
inherent kinetic energy that can be converted to moving it over the
fence than does a slower-moving pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1990 book, ``The Physics of Baseball,'' physics professor
Robert K. Adair of Yale University showed that for a batter
swinging squarely at 70 m.p.h., a 60 m.p.h. pitch will travel only
360 feet, but a 95 m.p.h. fastball will carry more like 380 feet.
In many parks, that's the difference between a warning-track out
and an over-the-fence homer.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the varying dimensions of ball parks make it easier to
hit homers in some than others.
</P>
<P>
   The trend towards building intimate ``bandbox'' arenas like
Baltimore's Camden Yards or Cleveland's Jacobs Field, many say, has
contributed to the slugging explosion of recent years. Five of the
13 top parks of 1995 for home runs were built after 1989, and at
least six stadiums _ including Mark McGwire's home field in St.
Louis _ have pulled in or lowered outfield fences since then.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just a few of the many factors that go into a home
run that are cited by Adair and other baseball-loving scientists:
</P>
<P>
   _Local weather. Depending on direction, a 10 m.p.h. wind can add
or subtract perhaps 35 feet from the ball's flight (particularly
noticeable at the San Francisco Giants' 3-Com Park, but a nonissue
at the Minnesota Twins' indoor Metrodome).
</P>
<P>
   Under identical circumstances, a given hit will travel about 12
feet farther on a 90-degree August afternoon than on a 50-degree
April or September evening, because the ball is bouncier and the
air is a tiny bit thinner. Likewise, 90 percent-plus humidity
thickening the air can take 30 feet off what would be a long ball
on an equally warm but drier day.
</P>
<P>
   Daily variations in the barometric pressure at a given stadium
could determine whether a given hit nicks the wall or passes just
over an outfielder's glove. The difference between a a reading of
29.0 inches and 30.5 inches on the barometer might account for 9
extra feet on a hit, as the less dense air on a low pressure day
provides less resistance.
</P>
<P>
   _Elevation. Because the air is thinner, it's slightly easier to
hit a given pitch farther at the Atlanta Braves' Turner Field,
about 1,000 feet up in the Piedmont, than at sea-level Fenway Park.
It's easier still at the Colorado Rockies' mile-high Coors Field,
where more homers are hit than at any other stadium. Denver's thin
air could allow a 400-foot shot at an East Coast stadium to travel
440 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _Point of impact: Studies by scientists such as Adair and James
A. Sherwood, who runs a bat research lab at the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell, show that a batted ball's potential
distance begins to fall dramatically as the impact moves more than
a few inches from the ``sweet spot'' near the end of the bat's
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   A 390-foot shot from the heart of the sweet spot, Adair
calculated, would dwindle to about a 340-foot fly-out if hit two
inches closer to, or four inches farther from, the batter's hands.
Three inches closer still to the grip, and the hit is a blooper.
</P>
<P>
   _Angle of impact: Only one-ninth of the perimeter of the bat,
according to Adair, can be used to hit a home run. Most balls that
take off at an angle less than 20 degrees above horizontal will be
line drives or grounders; most that leave the bat at an angle
greater than 40 degrees above horizontal will go up more than out,
and drop for long flies.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account both the location of the sweet spot and the
fact that only a small sliver of the barrel's arc will propel the
ball at the correct angle, the average batter must make contact
with exactly the right 4 to 7 percent of the bat's surface to have
any hope for a home run. Some sluggers, like McGwire, are so strong
they can occasionally connect with the ball in close to their hands
or near the end of the bat and still hit it out.
</P>
<P>
   _Ball squishiness: Under major league standards, a ball's
``coefficient of restitution'' can vary about 6 percent from a
standard. That means one regulation ball might travel 10 feet
farther than another thrown and hit at the same speed.

WHY DO OWLS HOOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do owls `whoo'? Why don't they `caw'?
</P>
<P>
   C.L.G.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually some owls don't ``whoo'' at all. Screech owls make a
noise that sounds like a whistling horse whinny. Barred owls hoot,
haw, and sometimes scream. Barn owls hiss. Only the great horned
owl, a common species in the area, really ``whoos.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do owls, or any bird, vocalize at all? Ron Rohrbaugh of the
Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology says they're either
alerting fellow species members to danger, staying in touch with
members of their flock, or begging for food.
</P>
<P>
   But while all birds vocalize, Rohrbaugh says, with few
exceptions, only males sing _ to search out mates and defend their
territory. (Female cardinals do sing, and the mating ceremony of
the Carolina wren involves a male-female duet.)
</P>
<P>
   And why do some birds ``chick-a-dee-dee-dee'' and some
``quack-quack?'' So individual species can communicate only among
themselves. If you're a blue jay alerting fellow blue jays to
danger, you need a unique language that your jay pals alone will
recognize. If you're a fledgling house finch squawking for food,
you don't want a heron bringing you a fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
   Males of different species sing different songs for the same
reason, Rohrbaugh says. A wood thrush singing to attract a mate
doesn't want a great horned owl showing up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And if you're a house sparrow joining that great dawn chorus
of birds singing to let other house sparrows know that you survived
the night and are re-establishing your territory, you need a song
the other sparrows will recognize. You don't much care about
goldfinches or woodpeckers in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   And, you might ask, are birds born with a song in their hearts?
Researchers working with newly-hatched chicks isolated from all
bird sounds have found that some species do indeed know their music
from birth, and that some learn it. Some species learn to sing
another species' song if that's all they hear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do humans need the ability to taste sour and bitter
things?
</P>
<P>
   K.W. Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sour and bitter tastes are probably warning you that what
you've got in your mouth isn't good for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many compounds that taste bitter are toxic,'' says Dr. Paul
Breslin, a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia. ``For example, most medicines taste bitter. All
medicines are toxic at high doses. If you were foraging and you bit
into something horribly nasty bitter in the wild, you'd probably be
better off not eating that stuff. You'd probably get sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have evolved the rule of thumb that if it tastes nasty
bitter, don't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three theories on sour, based on the fact that sour
foods are acidic. And there are good reasons to avoid acids.
</P>
<P>
   1. Acid erodes your teeth and causes oral ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 2. Unripe fruit is acidic. Riper fruit is sweeter. We want
sugars in our food for the calories (unless we're on a diet); sour
steers us away from the unripe.
</P>
<P>
   3. In some foods, a sour taste is a warning that the food has
spoiled. Ever gulp a mouthful of spoiled milk? You'd be awfully
sick if that sour taste didn't prompt you to spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and salt tastes, on the other hand, evolved not discourage
us from eating what's bad for us, but to encourage us to eat things
we need. We need the sweet for the calories, and salt to maintain
fundamental body chemistry. That probably explains why we have the
most sensation of sweet and salt in the front of our tongues, where
we sample things to see how they taste. Sour is more noticeable on
the sides, and bitter in the back, probably to make us gag and not
swallow a potential poison.
</P>
<P>
   But it's myth that you taste only certain tastes with certain
parts of your tongue. While tastes are concentrated in certain
areas, you can pick up any taste anywhere on your tongue, even on
the soft palate on the top of your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fifth taste you can throw in there,'' Breslin tells
us. ``Since the turn of the century, the Japanese have recognized
what they call `umami' (ooh-MOMMY).'' It's the taste of broth rich
in monosodium glutamate from foods like shitake mushrooms, sea
weed, or bonito (fish). Breslin says umami broths taste a little
like chicken soup. Western scientists are just starting to
recognize umami as an officialtaste.

WATCHING FALL TV: NEW SEASON, OLD FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all depends on what you mean by ``new.'' We may be on the
verge of the 1998 fall season, the first batch of TV series since
the ``Seinfeld'' Four were sent up to syndication lockdown, but
most of the comedies and dramas the networks are ready to unveil
are about as new as jokes that end with ``yadda yadda yadda.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems as though TV executives think we can never watch too many
``Mary Tyler Moore Show''-style office sitcoms. And they just know
our lives would be less exciting without a couple of ``Ally
McBeal'' wannabes, or a medical drama begging for comparisons with
``ER,'' or, since ``The Love Boat'' was already dredged up last
season, a remake of that other late 1970s schlockfest, ``Fantasy
Island.'' They don't want us to feel vertigo, either, from seeing
too many unusual faces each week. That's why this season is thick
with TV alumni like Shannen Doherty, Ken Olin, Peter Horton, Faith
Ford, Linda Lavin, Christina Applegate, Jeremy Piven, the Olsen
twins, Brian Benben, and Jerry Stiller, all back in new vehicles.
Alas, Ted Danson and his newest sitcom, ``Becker,'' have been
postponed until midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Would we truly be shocked by the new? The irony of the network's
safe approach is that many of TV's best and biggest moments _
``Seinfeld'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' for example _ have been the
result of gambling, and not cloning. After all, nothing meaningful
came from those very many ``Friends'' copycats that arrived all
dolled up in cool haircuts, from ``The Single Guy'' to ``Union
Square.'' If the networks are feeling threatened by the cable
universe (and they should: This summer, cable channels actually won
better ratings than the networks over two consecutive weeks), then
they might want to reassess their battle plan. Viewers are growing
less intimidated by cable's kajillion channels, and more willing to
try less formulaic cable series on Lifetime, Comedy Central, and
VH1. And they don't seem exactly thrilled with the networks' notion
of series television _ of all the new shows that premiered on the
three majors last fall, only three have survived: ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ``Veronica's Closet,'' and ``Working.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, experimentation doesn't always equal creative
success, as evidenced by this season's most mindbendingly inane
show, ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' (Mondays at 9 on
UPN). It was imaginative, perhaps, to set a sitcom in Abraham
Lincoln's White House; but it was out-and-out absurd to use slavery
as a vehicle for humor, and to rely on jokes about stained dresses
and _ I kid you not _ toe cheese. It makes you long for ``Union
Square,'' almost.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' aside, the fall 1998 season
does not qualify as a disaster. It may be familiar, and bland, and
skewed on the young-and-pretty side, and it may offer up no
creative force prepared to dethrone David E. Kelley, the man
responsible for two of last year's finest shows _ ``Ally McBeal''
and ``The Practice.'' Still a few of the new harvest _
``Felicity,'' ``Will and Grace,'' ``Sports Night,'' ``Buddy Faro,''
``Maggie Winters,'' ``Jesse,'' ``Cupid'' _ show enough promise in
their pilot episodes to make up for insultingly infantile new fare
like Fox's ``Holding the Baby'' (Sundays at 7:30 on Fox). With some
tweaking, they stand a chance to last longer than Tom Selleck's
latest TV comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The best premiere of the season is on the up-and-coming WB
network, which is creating a solid youth-market niche with hits
like ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' It's a
drama called ``Felicity'' (Tuesdays at 9), but of course it's not
about blissfulness. Angst is the ticket, as a high school graduate
named Felicity goes against her controlling parents to chase a guy
to a New York university. She's like Claire Danes from ``My
So-Called Life'' in college, or Calista Flockhart from ``Ally
McBeal'' before law school, but she's also uniquely Felicity,
especially as played by talented newcomer Keri Russell. If
``Felicity'' were a movie, about a people-pleasing teenager who
hungers for real experience, it would be directed by Cameron Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new shows split along gender lines, focusing either
on women trying to make it after all, or men in need of some heavy
bonding. The cosmetic and costume artists of ``Maggie Winters''
(Wednesdays at 8:30 on CBS) have worked hard to give star Faith
Ford that Ally McBeal bounce. But even as she spews high-strung
emotionality all over her supporting cast, the ``Murphy Brown''
alum makes an appealingly distinct impression. The show's concept,
like the Sandra Bullock movie ``Hope Floats,'' has Maggie moving
back home after a bad marriage, and reuniting with her high school
pals, who haven't changed since graduation. It's a charming sitcom
that argues we're all teenagers just below our adult surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of new comedies feature young blonde women waitressing in
bars and trying to exceed their blue-collar roots. ``Jesse''
(Thursdays at 8:30 on NBC) couldn't ask for a better time slot _
after ``Friends'' and before ``Frasier.'' But it may also succeed
on both the star quality of ``Married ... With Children'' alum
Christina Applegate, who plays a single mom hoping to become a
nurse, and a warm ensemble of men, including a slacker brother
who's taken a vow of silence. ``Costello'' (Tuesdays at 8:30 on
Fox) will have a rougher road, and not because it's set in a bar in
our own South Boston. With her loud delivery, stand-up comic Sue
Costello is more of an acquired taste than Applegate. She's like
one of Gilda Radner's wacky characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed'' (Wednesdays at 9 on WB) offers the irresistible
attraction of watching former ``Beverly Hills 90210'' brat Shannen
Doherty play a witch. In this girl-power drama of the supernatural,
Doherty and her two sisters fight ghouls without parental guidance
in picturesque San Francisco. It's ``Party of Five'' meets
``Buffy'' meets ``Sabrina.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as He TV goes, you can put away the Viagra. Most of these
guys are having pretty serious woman trouble. The most
disappointing of the boys club may be ``The Secret Lives of Men''
(Wednesdays at 9:30 on NBC), a sitcom about a trio of divorced
lunkheads who are burned by their exes and try to support one
another during and after golf games. Guys are people, too, you
know. Too bad Peter Gallagher is so wooden (and his accent is so
unnatural), and too bad the savvy about life after divorce doesn't
extend beyond lines like ``I'm finally able to take a nice,
peaceful dump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' (Tuesdays at 9:30 on ABC) is better at
capturing a buddy chemistry, in large part thanks to the sure hand
of creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin (he wrote ``A Few
Good Men'' and ``The American President''). The two leads, played
by Josh Charles and Peter Krause, are anchors of an ESPN-like
sports channel, and they deal with personal (divorce) and
professional (accuracy) conflicts. It's a state-of-the-art media
comedy, with influences from the movie ``Broadcast News'' and TV
series like ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and ``Lateline,'' with an
uncanny ability to slip dramatic moments into its newsroom frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers form the dramatic center of ``Wind on Water''
(Saturdays at 8 on NBC), the season's most picturesque _ and most
turgid _ series. These dudes, Cole and Kelly, are expert surfers,
so the hour is filled with bloated wave sequences and oh-so-earthy
posing by their newly widowed mom, Bo Derek (no kidding). Sorry,
Bo, this show is a 1, not a 10. On the other hand, the pilot for
``Buddy Faro'' (Fridays at 9 pm CBS) is a wonderfully stylized hour
that bodes well for the crime series. Dennis Farina and Frank
Whaley are buddy private investigators in a garish, jazzy Los
Angeles that's just swimming with sharks.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the fall guys are on their own. Poor ``Conrad
Bloom'' (Mondays at 8:30 on NBC) is surrounded by a whack pack of
needy women who keep him from finding true love. This sitcom stars
the easy-to-watch Mark Feuerstein, last seen on the un-dear
departed ``Fired Up,'' but it needs to find an identity. ``The
Brian Benben Show'' (Mondays at 9:30 on CBS) also gives us a hero
alone, a divorced news anchor demoted to features correspondent.
Benben, from ``Dream On,'' does his crazed shtick well enough, but
his vehicle needs to become something more than just a
run-of-the-mill media sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Brimstone'' (Tuesdays at 9 on Fox), Peter Horton is doomed
to be alone, since, of course, he is dead. No, it's not a sequel
series to ``thirtysomething,'' on which Horton passed unexpectedly
out of this world in a car crash. It's a hokey thriller about the
living dead doing battle on Earth. On ``Will and Grace'' (Mondays
at 9:30 on NBC), Will is probably doomed to remain single, since,
of course, he is a gay man on network TV. This sitcom version of
``My Best Friend's Wedding'' revolves around the love between a
willful straight woman and a graceful gay man. It's got a lot of
potential. And on the unexpectedly promising ``Cupid'' (Saturdays
at 10 on ABC), Jeremy Piven will probably remain unattached since,
of course, he is the god of love. He's been put on Earth (sans bow
and arrow) to match up 100 couples.
</P>
<P>
   The two best shots at strong drama are ``L.A. Doctors'' (Mondays
at 10 on CBS) and ``Trinity'' (Fridays at 9 on NBC). Ken Olin began
to turn slimy on ``thirtysomething,'' but on ``L.A. Doctors'' he
goes all the way as a publicity-hungry MD looking to make a million
in a managed-care environment. The show will need to work up some
new ethical quandaries if it wants to survive against ``ER'' and
``Chicago Hope.'' ``Trinity,'' on the other hand, has way too many
ethical challenges for its own good. What do you expect from a
family whose siblings include an avenging cop, a liberal priest, a
substance abuser, and a woman in love with a married man?
Simplification is in order on ``Trinity,'' especially since the
cast, including Tate Donovan, is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Last, and close to least, is the new ``Fantasy Island''
(Saturdays at 9 on ABC). Sure, executive producer Barry Sonnenfeld,
director of ``The Addams Family'' and ``Men in Black,'' has gussied
up this relic with some neat special effects and a sly Mr. Rourke
in the person of Malcolm McDowell. But the plots, in which
unsuspecting visitors learn big lessons on the island, are
painfully manipulative and moralistic. I think that kind of easy
answering was tired even back in the 1970s.

A RUBE AND A SLICKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whe Ethan Canin wowed critics with the beauty of his premiere
1988 story collection, ``Emperor of the Air,'' it was partly
because he was a kid with a Harvard medical degree _ a
well-marketed 27-year-old who had already survived a residency as
well as a debut in The New Yorker. That's the kind of transient
glory that publicists adore, but Canin had something far better to
offer. At its finest, his fiction is thick with longing: a
luminiscent ode to want and regret. Steeped in dreams but bound to
the ordinary covenants of a day, his characters are delivered to us
by way of the small humiliations and triumphs most people rarely
reveal but nearly always possess. In the presence of a Canin
epiphany, the morning light across a bank of trees may be enough to
bless a life, but not so that anyone else would notice.
</P>
<P>
   This depth of character is most successfully evoked in Canin's
short fiction, where the form requires inner impetus rather than
external range. Certainly the novel ``For Kings and Planets'' has
hints of it, particularly in the ocean-liner momentum of its
protagonist, an endearingly stalwart fellow named Orno Tarcher. But
Canin has returned here to a brooding filial theme _ it defined his
first novel, ``Blue River,'' as well as one of the novellas in
``The Palace Thief'' _ and written a far-flung work about two men
whose friendship is a study in contrasts. The result is uneven:
Some moments I loved ``For Kings and Planets''; at other times, I
wanted to send Canin back to class at the Iowa Writers' Workshop,
where he's now a teacher. With its impressive melancholy detail and
its cliched novelistic conceits, the book combines everything Canin
does right with some things he shouldn't be doing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The novel opens with that gravely retrospective phrase, ``Years
later,'' and so we know that Orno Tarcher, at least will survive to
remember the tale. When he arrives at Columbia University one
bright September day in 1974, he's a young man straight off the
farmland of Cook's Grange, Mo. _ upright and well-intentioned, both
terrified of and drawn to the inevitable expatriate's alienation
that awaits him. Within hours he has met Marshall Emerson, a
fatally ironic sophisticate with a probably-dark past who will show
Orno the world, then challenge him with it. Where Orno is solemn
and plodding, Marshall is capricious and brilliant; where the
Midwesterner is intent upon an education, perhaps in engineering,
Marshall, given his lifestyle habits, may well not make it through
the night. It's type cast against type, in other words, with Orno
playing the innocent rube from tractor country against Marshall's
Manhattan psychollectual: William Styron's Stingo to Nathan, say,
or a dozen other hayseed-cosmopolitan dyads of popular fiction.
</P>
<P>
   While Orno buries himself in chemistry texts, Marshall drinks
shots down at the neighborhood pseudo-literary bar and tries to
corrupt his friend; when Orno takes up with a Russian girlfriend,
Marshall charms her, then steals her away. The friendship between
the two men is a long, competitive, displaced seduction, sublimated
by women who don't matter and complicated by the one who does:
Marshall's little sister, who seems to have more sense than the
rest of the Emersons put together. When Marshall makes a feeble
suicide attempt and calls Orno, it's Simone Emerson, 17, who
accepts her brother's act for the performance it is, though she's
also fiercely loyal to him, even when his toxic manipulation
targets her. But then everyone is loyal to Marshall; he has the
force of a tornado. Not to mention the potential for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of Marshall's family pathology appear early on in ``For
Kings and Planets'': the unhappy contract of his intellectual
parents, both academics; the murderous footrace between father and
son for most-miserable status; the absent mother in Marshall's
first few years; the casual lying that hovers over his every
enchanting tale. He'll be the storm Orno has to define himself
against: a worthy adversary promising everything, presenting a
world that is beautiful but based on false gods. And it will be
Orno's predictable task to defy and transcend him. When the good
Midwestern boy applies to dental school, you sense that his awkward
acceptance of his lot will also be his saving.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, as familiar as this dark fraternal theme is, the
tempest between Orno and Marshall isn't the real problem with ``For
Kings and Planets''; it's a compelling formula, the way ``ER'' or
childhood fables are engagingly predictable. That can be one of the
pleasures of popular fiction, and while Canin has proved his mettle
at more literary and less compulsively readable pursuits, I don't
mean to undermine the straightforward narrative thrust this novel
accomplishes. More problematic, and ultimately annoying, is the way
Canin himself romanticizes Marshall, and thus undermines (and
thins) his character. What we have here is a near-sociopathic guy
with a suicidal streak as wide as Route 128 _ a fellow who
sabotages his family and friends, then shows up at 3 a.m. insisting
they join him in a glass of French Champagne. This isn't alluring;
it's pathetic. The tragic side of Marshall's personality is
eclipsed by his charisma rather than illuminated by it; drawn too
sympathetically, characters like this simply don't work anymore,
and haven't since Raymond Chandler.  &UR; ufspanish &LR; Oh, sure, he seems
darkly fabulous when he quotes Auden _ but that has more to do with
the beauty of ``Musee des Beaux Arts'' than with Marshall's eidetic
memory.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few errors in ``For Kings and Planets'' that a
writer of Canin's gifts shouldn't make: occasional tin-ear
dialogue, overuse of italics, internal inconsistences (the gender
of a cat keeps changing, for instance). But with Orno Tarcher _
lovable, earth-deep Orno _ Canin beautifully creates a character he
knows well. Like Abba Roth, the accountant-narrator of a novella in
``The Palace Thief,'' Orno is a steady man drawn with a slow hand;
the excruciating complexity of his feelings toward his father _ a
mix of familiarity and shame _ so precisely captures the
ambivalence of a son's love that it brings tears to one's eyes. We
love Orno for the same reasons Marshall loves him. He is the
essence of guilelessness and decency, and his generosity is as
natural to him as breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for his own reasons, Canin seems mesmerized by Marshall
but actually understands Orno better _ understands the gravitas and
tenacity that, in so many cases, collude to create a life. While
``For Kings and Planets'' is an easily gratifying story, full of
shadowy omens and potentially happy endings, I do hope Canin has
got the Cain-and-Abel thing out of his system. ``Nobody changes,''
Marshall tells Orno. ``They just reveal themselves.'' In this case,
the tortured anti-hero keeps turning up as the same unhappy fellow.

NEWSMAGAZINES DOMINATE NONFICTION TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't like TV newsmagazines? Then you'd better keep your channel
clicker handy this fall, because the television schedule will be
more crowded than ever with the progeny of ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   By remaining relatively cheap to produce at a time when the cost
of sitcoms and dramas is skyrocketing, one-hour newsmagazines have
become the first resort of networks looking to plug holes in their
prime-time schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, with their mixture of tearjerking stories,
exposes, and celebrity interviews, newsmagazines are emerging as a
force that could dominate the new television season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they will have the field to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most anticipated programs is CNN's ``Cold War,'' a
24-part documentary hosted by Kenneth Branagh that is slated to
begin on Sept. 27. If you're in the mood for something less
weighty, A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' series this week launches a ``Can We
Talk?'' series of profiles of Regis Philbin, Merv Griffin, Don
Imus, Joan Rivers, and Geraldo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, PBS has several significant projects on tap. On Sept.
21-23, PBS will broadcast ``The Farmer's Wife,'' a chronicle of the
ups and downs of a Nebraska farming family by Newton filmmaker
David Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   The WGBH-Ch. 2 production of ``Africans in America,'' a
four-part documentary on the role played by Africans in the
founding of the United States, airs Oct. 19-22. The prodigious Ken
Burns is back on PBS Nov. 10-11 with ``Frank Lloyd Wright,'' a
documentary on the fabled architect.
</P>
<P>
   But on the commercial networks, newsmagazines will hold sway,
week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has added an extra night of ``Dateline NBC,'' meaning the
newsmagazine _ which debuted on a single night in 1992 _ is now
spread across five nights of prime time: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Friday. That is a remarkable chunk of choice real
estate on the No. 1 network.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, meanwhile, ``20-20'' is adding an extra show next week,
meaning the newsmagazine (into which ``PrimeTime Live'' will be
absorbed after this week) will now air three times a week: Sunday,
Wednesday, and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has plunged headfirst into the newsmagazine world with
``NewsStand'' (a Sunday show that repeats on Monday, plus new shows
on Wednesday and Thursday), and Fox News Channel recently launched
its own entrant, ``Fox Files,'' on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   As for the granddaddy of them all, ``60 Minutes,'' the venerable
Sunday-night CBS franchise is expected to clone itself for a second
weekly edition by midseason, while ``48 Hours'' remains on the CBS
schedule as well, on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not every newsmagazine is guaranteed success. CBS
dropped ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel'' from the fall schedule
(though there's an outside chance it could resurface at midseason).
But in general, newsmagazines have proven remarkably durable and
popular with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially evident this summer, when regular network
entertainment programming went into reruns, viewers shifted in
droves to newsmagazines. During one stretch, ``60 Minutes''
finished first in the ratings four times in five weeks. In late
July, six newsmagazines ranked in the Top 10; in the most recent
Nielsen ratings report, for the week of Aug. 24-30, eight of the
top 20 shows were newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the popularity of newsmagazines may be
that they feature some of the best-known anchors and reporters:
ABC's Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer, NBC's Jane Pauley, CBS's
Mike Wallace, CNN's Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, newsmagazines such as ``Dateline'' are able to
broaden their horizons by discarding previously scheduled stories
at a moment's notice to pounce on breaking news developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do an expanded version of a news story in prime time,''
says ``Dateline'' spokesman Cory Shields, pointing to the show's
recent handling of Hurricane Bonnie and the stock-market plunge.
``People can tune in and get the major news story of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the wave of the future. As busy careers result in
fewer people getting home in time for the traditional early-evening
newscasts, networks may increasingly package miniature newscasts
into newsmagazines, which generally air between 9 and 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? If newsmagazines continue on their current roll,
maybe ``Dateline,'' rather than ``Seinfeld,'' will be rememberd as
the most-copied show of the 1990s.

`PRIMARY COLORS' FADED; `WILD THINGS' WILD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Primary Colors''  &LR; _ Once again, history
outstrips fiction. Since President Clinton's confession, this
so-called satire has become as old-fashioned as Margaret Truman's
piano playing. While populated with terrific performances, this
Mike Nichols-directed political parody, based on Joe Klein's novel,
has already lost its punch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Wild Things'' &LR;  _ John McNaughton directs the neo-noir set in
Florida with Bill Murray as sleazy, sex-mad Matt Dillon's nutty
attorney. Sometimes it's tough to follow all the twists and turns,
but one of the advantages of home video is that the slower thinkers
like myself can hit the rewind button to catch the stuff that
sneaked by the first time. Add Denise Richards and Neve Campbell as
a pair of diabolical nymphets and it makes for some wild times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``John and Julie''  &LR; _ This odd little artifact focuses on two
children escaping to London to see the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II. A bit slow, but the nonfiction footage of the queen's
ascension and an appearance by Peter Sellers make it more than just
a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Elvis Meets Nixon''  &LR; _ This fanciful story surrounding the
meeting of Richard Nixon and Elvis Presley gives further proof that
the cable networks _ specifically HBO and Showtime _ provide a
great home for quirky ideas that don't fit Hollywood's
mega-marketing machine. Extremely entertaining and very smart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Pentagon Wars'' &LR;  _ This HBO production, directed by
Richard Benjamin, stars Kelsey Grammer as an incompetent general
trying to cover up military miscalculations. Grammer is great as
the egotistical militarist and the script is very clever.

 MASS x VELOCITY PLUS OTHER STUFF EQUALS: `IT'S GONE!'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good thing baseball home run kings Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa don't have to run the equations before they decide whether to
swing for the fences, or Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs would
have faced no threat.
</P>
<P>
   Considered as a matter of physics and physiology, using a bat to
smack a fast-moving baseball over a stadium fence is a stunningly
complicated feat to calculate and achieve even once _ much less
with the regularity that the St. Louis Cardinals' McGwire and
Chicago Cubs' Sosa have been doing it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a tremendous feat to hit a ball 400 feet,'' says
physics professor Robert K. Adair of Yale University, who has
written a book on the subject, called `The Physics of Baseball.'
``It requires a phenomenal concentration of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular shibboleth of sports journalism holds that no task in
sport is harder than hitting a baseball with a bat. Back in the
late 1980s, the late A. Bartlett Giamatti, a Yale president and
baseball nut who went on to be National League president and then
baseball commissioner after leaving New Haven, encouraged Adair to
bring his loves of physics and baseball to bear on explaining just
how it is done.
</P>
<P>
   Through research that included developing a complex equation
explaining the physics of a home run, Adair showed that to drive a
fastball coming at you at 90 m.p.h. over a big-league stadium fence
requires swinging a bat at better than 70 m.p.h. McGwire and Sosa,
Adair thinks, probably often exceed 80 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but given that a &UR;  &LR; fastball reaches the plate in
less than half a second, a batter must decide in a fifth of a
second after the ball's release whether to swing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Mis-timing his swing by 1/100th of a second will mean the
difference between a foul ball and a four-bagger. A 1/200th second
difference will determine whether the ball travels to right,
center, or left field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not for nothing did legendary Boston Braves pitcher
Warren Spahn once observe: ``Hitting is timing. Pitching is
upsetting timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his research, Adair found that during the 1/1,000th of a
second that a slugger like McGwire or Sosa is actually making
contact with the ball for a home run, he is exerting something like
8,000 pounds of force on it _ the equivalent of an elephant's
stepping on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 1/20th of a second before a slugger makes contact,
Adair calculated, his body is generating an astounding 10
horsepower of energy _ 70 times as much as a manual laborer might
exert during a workday _ virtually all of it concentrated in
whipping the bat around.
</P>
<P>
   The basic equation involved is that mass times velocity _ the
weight and speed of the bat _ determines the force with which the
ball is hit, and the faster the ball is pitched, the faster and
therefore farther it's hit.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows there is no such thing as the ideal-sized bat.
Babe Ruth was known to use 44- and even 47-ounce bats for his
legendary drives. McGwire uses a 36-ounce bat. Sosa and the Seattle
Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. use 31-ounce models.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there an ideal-sized batter or ideal hitting technique.
While McGwire and Sosa have been going head-to-head in the home run
race all summer, they are remarkably different physical specimens,
McGwire 250 well-muscled pounds on a 6-foot-5-inch frame, Sosa just
200 pounds and 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Where McGwire uses fierce power in his swing and an unorthodox
one-handed follow-through, Cubs batting coach Jeff Pentland told
reporters earlier this year that Sosa ``does it in a different way,
with quickness and sharpness. He's certainly a well-built guy, but
he's not a physical presence'' like McGwire or some of the other
big sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   And as hard as both McGwire and Sosa swing, much of their effort
goes for naught. Adair found that as a general rule, only half the
energy in the swing is transmitted to the ball, the rest lost to
wind resistance or absorbed by the bat and the batter's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of the energy that does meet the ball, one-third is lost to
distorting and heating the ball through friction (a well-hit ball
will get 1 degree Farenheit warmer from the impact, and its
diameter will briefly shrink to half its normal size).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only one-third of the force a slugger like McGwire
is developing at the plate goes into the ball's ultimate flight _
and still he often sends it 450 or 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone possibly decide in 2/10ths of a second, about the
minimum time the average person can sensibly react to anything,
whether to swing at a pitch?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound. Adair said he thinks batters work on ``pattern
recognition,'' seeing in the windup and delivery of pitchers they
face over and over again clues that tell them what pitch is coming.
(But a pitcher who tips off the hitter that way isn't going to last
long). Some hitters claim they can pick up the rotation of the ball
in flight and thus know what kind of pitch it is.
</P>
<P>
   Others claim the best batters make an educated guess about
what's coming next. Cardinals' hitting coach Dave Parker has been
quoted as saying McGwire correctly guesses what kind of
pitch &UR;  &LR; he'll be seeing 85 percent of the time _ often seeming to
sense before it &UR;  &LR; before it is thrown the one hittable pitch he
might get in an at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look to either McGwire or Sosa for a detailed explanation
of what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talk technical baseball,'' McGwire told the Sporting
News' Steven Marantz this summer. ``There are things the media
don't need to know. There are things my teammates don't know about.
I just keep it to myself...Someday, when I'm a coach, I'll talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, a formerly erratic slugger who last year set the Cubs team
record for strikeouts with 174, says he has learned to be more
choosy. ``I have to go out and try to make contact,'' he said
recently. ``Don't swing at so many bad pitches, because that was my
problem before. So that's what I'm doing right now: I'm more
patient, I'm more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   However much science can explain about what happens, as McGuire
and Sosa movedit remains clear to Adair and others that a big part
of it is innate talent, endlessly honed instinct, and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when two nuclear physicists from the University of
California at Berkeley developed what they called a ``formula for
the perfect swing'' based in part on films of the Red Sox' Ted
Williams, the last slugger to hit over .400 in a season, Will Clark
brought them back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a perfect swing,'' said the Texas
first baseman, who's hit quite a few homers in his career.
``There's 9,000 different theories on how to hit a baseball. The
big thing about it is just hitting the darned thing.''

MARK STEVEN JOHNSON MAKES A JOHN IRVING-INSPIRED MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Irving is one of the great writers of the past
quarter-century. He writes sprawling, enthralling books packed with
complicated and eccentric characters, whose lives are often marked
by stunning, sudden tragedy and violence. He takes common themes _
family, love, friendship, death _ and spins them into grand,
decades-spanning tales seasoned with humor and horror, pain and
poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   What John Irving doesn't do is write books easily made into
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some have tried. Director George Roy Hill, along with
stars Robin Williams, Glenn Close, and John Lithgow, wrestled with
``The World According to Garp,'' in 1982. The end result, while
watchable, was little more than the book's greatest hits _ a clip
job of quirky moments and characters that missed the book's charms.
Two years later, Tony Richardson had a go at ``The Hotel New
Hampshire,'' with Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, and Beau Bridges, but
again the film never found the pulse of Irving's words.
</P>
<P>
   Even Irving himself has had difficulty turning his novels into
movies. For years, he tried unsuccessfully to write a screenplay
based on ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,'' his novel about an unlikely
friendship, Vietnam, and religion. So more than a few people
wondered aloud why Mark Steven Johnson, the young screenwriter best
known for the ``Grumpy Old Men'' films with Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau, would want to tackle Irving's 1989 book as his directorial
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished the book, I put it down and thought, `This is
going to be a nightmare to try to make into a movie, and I'm not
quite sure how it can be done, but this will be the movie I
direct,'' Johnson said during a recent visit to Boston. ``But I
knew I had to do something so radical to it; in my estimation,
that's the only way it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's ``radical'' vision, Owen Meany became ``Simon
Birch,'' which opens Friday. Instead of spanning 15 years, it has
been streamlined into one extraordinary year in the lives of two
friends: Joe (Joseph Mazzello), the illegitimate son of an
independent-minded woman (Ashley Judd), and Simon (Ian Michael
Smith), a boy born small enough to fit in the palm of the doctor's
hand, who believes he is an instrument of the Lord. The film also
stars Oliver Platt and David Strathairn.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's credits, Johnson's screenplay is said to be
``suggested by'' Irving's novel, although Johnson believes
``inspired by'' is more accurate. (The Writers Guild wanted and got
``suggested by.'') The setting has moved from the 1950s to the
1960s, and the characters now live in Gravestown, Maine, instead of
Gravesend, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, Johnson believes he is faithful to the
novel's spirit, keeping its opening, heard in voice-over by the
adult Joe, played in a cameo by Jim Carrey:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice _
not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I
ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother's
death, but because he is the reason I believe in God.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``I like `inspired by' better,'' Johnson said. `Suggested by'
sounds strange, and it doesn't give enough credit to how much of
the novel really is in this movie, which is a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans of the book, Johnson keeps the stuffed armadillo, and
the fatal foul ball. Of course, it might not be enough to satisfy
Irving devotees, which is why the author suggested a name change,
said Johnson, who came up with Simon Birch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `They need to know that if you're looking for a
faithful adaptation of `A Prayer for Owen Meany,' you're not going
to find it,''' Johnson said. ``You'll find a lot of the book, but
it's not a word-for-word adaptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports to the contrary, Johnson maintains Irving has
been supportive of the film. The two men, he said, have been in
constant contact about the script's development and its deviations
from Irving's book. The most-debated aspect, Johnson said, was his
decision to eliminate the Vietnam War, the setting of the book's
dramatic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said, `My novel is about two things _ religion and
Vietnam. You want to take Vietnam out, and that's half the novel to
me,''' said Johnson, recalling Irving's conversation. ``I said to
John, `I don't know what else to say about Vietnam.' As far as
movies go, there've been so many Vietnam movies. At the end of the
day, it's really the same theme _ Vietnam was a mistake, war is
hell, the government lied to us. It's all true, but to me it wasn't
interesting anymore, and if I didn't have anything fresh to say
about it, I didn't want to say anything. He got that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change also altered the story's dramatic structure.
Irving's book spans 1953 to 1968; Johnson instead concentrates on
1964, when Joe and Simon are 11 years old. He always knew he wanted
to center his film during the boys' childhood, but that idea became
especially clear when he found an actor to play Simon, ``the
smallest delivery ever recorded in the history of Gravestown
Memorial Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson discovered Ian Michael Smith, now 12, shortly after the
boy lost a role in ``The Mighty,'' starring Sharon Stone, to Kieran
Culkin. In that film Culkin plays a boy with Morquio's syndrome,
which causes dwarfism; Smith was born with the same rare condition.
Casting directors familiar with the 3-foot-1-inch Smith soon
alerted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `This kid's amazing, you gotta meet him,''' Johnson
said. ``When I met him, my jaw dropped. I said, `That's him, that's
the guy, I just know it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he tested others for the part, Johnson hired an acting
coach for Smith, who had no professional experience. He saw more
than 100 kids worldwide, but always knew Smith was Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them had what Ian had,'' Johnson said. ``When he
smiles, you smile. He just lights up the screen, and he breaks your
heart. I was afraid the studio would be worried because he's not
traditionally cute. He's not an adorable Disney tyke. But I just
thought he was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a dramatic film, albeit one with comic moments, may seem
a departure for Johnson, 33, unless you're familiar with his own
loopy entry into Hollywood. Born in Minnesota, Johnson moved to Los
Angeles in his 20s to pursue a film career. He wound up as an
$8-an-hour secretary at Orion Pictures. Between sorting faxes and
answering phones, he wrote his first script. At a time when other
25-year-olds were working on their latest screed to 20-something
angst or imitating Quentin Tarantino, Johnson was writing about
cranky sexagenarians and ice fishing in his native Minnesota.
``Grumpy Old Men,'' and its sequel, ``Grumpier Old Men,'' went on
to make more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time everyone was writing `Die Hard' movies _ `Die
Hard' on a bus, `Die Hard' on a plane. I tried to do that but I
just didn't know how to write that kind of movie,'' Johnson said.
``I didn't have that many life experiences, so I wrote about my
grandfather, who the Jack Lemmon character was based on, and I
wrote it in four weeks. It was this goofy movie about old people
and ice fishing, and it made people laugh. I think that's why it
stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, who worked at a hospital, passed the script to a
co-worker whose cousin was a former agent _ an LA story, if ever
there was one. The success of the film made Johnson a hot property,
and emancipated him from Orion's secretarial pool.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's moved from the ranks of screenwriters to the director's
chair with ``Simon Birch,'' and has been spared doing ``Grumpy Old
Men: The Next Generation,'' he said. When he was pitching the
project, the hardest thing was describing ``Simon Birch'' as
something the high-concept Hollywood minds could grasp. He told
them it's the story of two friends, each on a personal quest _ Joe,
to discover his father's identity, and Simon, to understand his
place in God's plan _ and how their separate destinies intersect in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Now if he can just sell that to audiences who've spent recent
months dodging asteroids and riled-up reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of a new pitch, Johnson paused for a beat, then said,
``Just tell people it's a Jim Carrey movie. Let's just get all the
money we can on the opening weekend, then run like hell.''

FICTIONAL DIARY DETAILS HELL IN CIVIL WAR PRISON 
</HEADLINE>

A SOLDIER'S BOOK 
By Joanna Higgins 
Permanent Press, 191 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the Civil War, mainly during its final 18 months, more
than 56,000 men, pretty evenly divided between Union soldiers and
Confederates, died in prisoner-of-war camps. They died of cholera
and yellow fever, of starvation and untended injuries. They
represented roughly 14 percent of all those held in the camps, both
North and South. A young Michigan sergeant being held in the
Confederate prison at Andersonville, Ga., wrote in his diary on
June 27, 1864: ``The further advanced the summer, the death rate
increases, until they die off by scores. I walk around to see
friends of a few days ago and am told, Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This passage from the diary of Sergeant John Ransom is quoted in
``Andersonville,'' MacKinlay Kantor's epic novel of 1955, one of
the few works of fiction to deal with the unremitting, inglorious
suffering of the prison camps. The diary form is adopted by Joanna
Higgins (author of a well-regarded story collection, ``The
Importance of High Places'') for her grim and gritty first novel,
``A Soldier's Book.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a literary journey ``farther and farther downward into the
valley of darkness'' _ to use a phrase that Higgins's fictional
diarist employs to describe his transportation to the prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of problems inherent in presenting a
fictional diary as the complete text of a novel. Since the diarist
has little or no reason to tell himself about his past life, and
since a novelist who plays fair can't go much farther than the
diarist does, the reader is forced to supply much of the context.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War does at least provide a general context familiar
to general readers. Nonetheless, ``A Soldier's Book'' sometimes
requires a quick look at a standard history _ or even at
``Andersonville'' (which almost inevitably becomes an extended
reading rather than a quick look). The military and political
issues of the prisoner-of-war exchanges, which occupy much of the
diarist's concern, is one such case. Another is the arrest, trial,
and hanging of a gang that had terrorized fellow Union prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than such background matters, the conventions
of the diary as novel require readers to stretch their imagination.
It is a tribute to Higgins's craft that, by and large, ``A
Soldier's Book'' works _ gradually so, as the diarist becomes a
fully realized character and the reader grows accustomed to his
point of view and his manner of writing.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins's diarist is Ira Cahill Stevens, a young apprentice
apothecary from northeastern Pennsylvania (where Higgins lives),
who was captured during the Battle of the Wilderness. The reader
learns little more about him, because it is his present condition
that is of overriding concern _ to the reader and the diarist.
</P>
<P>
   The diary entries cover some six months through the summer into
the fall of 1864, a period during which the humane practice of
routinely exchanging prisoners had been halted because Union
leaders realized that most exchanged Confederates were being sent
back to their regiments. Stuck with a growing number of internees,
both sides hastily threw up stockades in isolated locations.
Supplying the influx of prisoners with food or clothing, or
providing medical care, were afterthoughts at best.
</P>
<P>
   Still worse, the ending of exchanges deprived prisoners of hope;
speculation that they would be resumed are subjects of daily
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words the 7th pass man to man with the greatest
reverence,'' Stevens writes one day in July. ``Exchanges to
commence on that day, we hear. ... It is hard to wait with hope.
But harder without it. Hardest of all is to be a battlefield, the
slashing and cutting all inside.''
</P>
<P>
   So hopeless does even survival appear that prisoners often
crawled across the ``dead line,'' into the forbidden territory near
the stockade, knowing that sentries would see them _ and shoot
them. ``Saw another fellow exchange himself at the dead line,''
Stevens writes. ``Didn't make a sound. It's like some ordinary
transaction. An exchange in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing is plain and uncolored, as one would expect from a
diary, but no less vivid for that in its relating of incidents and
portrayal of comrades. And it is wonderfully compressed, as a diary
written under horrific conditions would be. The somewhat wooden
title is a reference to a pocket-size handbook published in
Cambridge in 1862 and intended for distribution to the young
Christian soldier going forth ``in defense of his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil War novels have most typically been a male thing, from
Stephen Crane to Charles Frazier. So Joanna Higgins joins a very
select company _ Margaret Mitchell, most famously, but also Mary
Johnston, the granddaughter of Confederate General Joseph E.
Johnston and author of two of the most vivid of all Civil War
novels, ``The Long Roll'' and ``Cease Firing.'' Here, it is a
soldier's hell that is made vivid.

ASIAN AMERICANS SEEK BROADER ROLE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For decades, Asian Americans have been lobbying
Hollywood to include more Asian faces in movies and television
shows. Now it's finally happening, although the result is not what
they hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come across Asians portrayed in the media these days,
it always has something to do with kung fu, or that stereotypical
evil mystique,'' said Nancy Hom, a San Francisco arts producer.
``We're either gambling or (taking) opium.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, little has changed in 20 years. And Hollywood's
recent fascination with the Hong Kong action genre has made some
feel that stereotyped characters have become even more prevalent.
``Lethal Action 4'' and ``Replacement Killers'' are two of the
latest films to feature Asian triad-types.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian Americans are now talking about the best way to
counter negative portrayals. Strategies range from protesting every
objectionable incident to just ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Nakasako is a documentary filmmaker who works with
underprivileged teen-agers in San Francisco, mostly immigrants from
Southeast Asia. The teens have grown up watching actor Jet Li as
the good guy in numerous Hong Kong action flicks, but were crushed
when they saw him play a menacing Asian mobster in ``Lethal Weapon
4,'' his first American film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of the kids I work with were really disappointed
because they're used to Jet Li being a hero,'' he said. ``They're
like, `How come he's a bad guy?' For them, it didn't make any
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Mel Gibson's character kills off Jet Li in a bloody,
brutal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Hamamoto, a professor of Asian-American studies at the
University of California at Davis, takes the criticism of ``Lethal
Weapon 4'' a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have everybody _ whites, blacks, Jews and feminists _
aligned against the yellow peril,'' he said, referring to
characters played by Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci and Rene
Russo.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. did not return calls for comment on ``Lethal Weapon
4.''
</P>
<P>
   Hom said Hollywood should strive to portray Asian Americans as
three-dimensional people and noted that omitting them was just as
objectionable as vilifying them.
</P>
<P>
   Television shows such as ``Party of Five'' and ``Suddenly
Susan,'' Hom said, took place in San Francisco but had nary an
Asian character. The city's population is 34 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hardly see an Asian even walking in the background,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Janet Yang disagrees that things are getting worse for
Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the situation is far from ideal, ``the opportunities
for Asian-American actors are incredible. I have friends playing
doctors and lawyers and judges and teachers on major shows,'' said
Yang, who was Oliver Stone's production partner for seven years
before starting her own company two years ago with another partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back 20 or 30 years,'' she said. ``There was nothing.
(Asian-American actors) back then were playing butlers and maids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, more and more Asian Americans are studio executives,
and doing better than their black and Hispanic counterparts, said
Yang, a producer of ``The Joy Luck Club.''
</P>
<P>
   A smattering of Asian Americans have begun to appear on TV. But
they remain the exception rather than the norm. Berkeley-based film
consultant Gary Meyer believes non-stereotypical roles for Asian
Americans have increased only minimally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the larger push has been to get African Americans in
less stereotypical roles,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   As interest in Asian culture grows, some studios are responding.
Disney's summer blockbuster ``Mulan,'' set in ancient China, has
been well-received by audiences, but some Asian Americans still saw
cause for complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must all sinister Chinese people have Fu Manchus?'' asked
columnist Emil Guillermo in a recent AsianWeek item criticizing the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based Media Action Network for Asian Americans
(MANAA) has been monitoring ethnic slurs and stereotypes in the
mass media since 1992. In its early days, the complaints it dealt
with were equally split between Korean and Japanese issues, said
spokesman Guy Aoki.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, every documented complaint was about use of the
word ``Chinaman.'' It appeared in numerous TV shows, radio
broadcasts and films, including ``U.S. Marshals'' and ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you'd have it here and there over the years, but
not like this,'' Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes it to the economic and political ascendance of
China, and media reports that commonly refer to it as the next
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everything is China,'' he said. ``China is in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   MANAA has had mixed success in meeting with the appropriate
executives and getting a public apology or retraction. One show it
did reach a satisfactory conclusion with was ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April 9 episode, a character joked that opium was like a
``Chinaman's nightcap.'' After MANAA objected, NBC agreed it had
erred and agreed to delete the line from subsequent showings.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of complaining, some Asian Americans are
beginning to wonder how they can be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too much emphasis is placed on what's politically
incorrect and not enough emphasis on what we're going to do about
it,'' said Jeff Adachi, a San Francisco public defender who also
chairs the Asian-American Arts Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Asian Americans should take out their wallets and
invest in the arts in the way African Americans have begun to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 70s, they had blaxploitation; we had Bruce Lee,'' he
said. ``It hasn't gone beyond that for Asians, whereas black cinema
has evolved.''

THE TENNIS PARTNER 
A Doctor's Story of Friendship and Loss 
By Abraham Verghese 
HarperCollins, 346 pp., $25 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In tennis, Abraham Verghese always found order.
</P>
<P>
   As a African-born boy of Indian parentage, he often felt like an
outsider, belonging neither here nor there in his Ethiopian
homeland. But always there was sanctuary in the particular rhythm
of ball against racquet. In his child's mind, he would imagine
conquering opponents such as Bill Tilden, Rod Laver, and Pancho
Segura with his prowess and speed. Whacking a ball against the side
of a shed began as a release, and evolved into a blessed ritual; it
was a sound of solace, and a retreat from his alienation.
</P>
<P>
   When Verghese took a position in the Texas Tech School of
Medicine in El Paso, he resumed his childhood passion, a love he
shared with David Smith, who had found in tennis a similar refuge
from his own dark places. The two became friends, and the game
granted both a safe place, a respite from life's uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tennis Partner: A Doctor's Story of Friendship and Loss''
is Verghese's heartbreaking recollection of his friendship with
Smith, a former student whose unshakable addiction to cocaine
unraveled his once-promising life. Indelible and haunting, it is an
elegy to friendship found, and an ode to a good friend lost.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many relationships, Verghese and Smith found one
another in difficult times. Verghese had recently moved to El Paso
with his wife, Rajani, and their sons, Steven and Jacob. It should
have been the best of times: At 37, he had been appointed a full
professor in the department of internal medicine at Texas Tech, and
he welcomed the challenge of starting life anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``A newcomer is unencumbered by his past, his mistakes, his
secrets unknown,'' he writes. ``This is the great promise of
moving: that if you fold your life into a U-Haul truck and put it
on the road, you will be given a clean plate with which to approach
the buffet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Verghese could not escape the growing rift between himself
and his wife of 11 years, and the concerns it raised for their
children. He would eventually move out of the house, and into an
apartment he tells his boys is a ``time out'' place.
</P>
<P>
   Things went considerably worse for Smith. A fourth-year medical
student from Australia, Smith had once been a good enough tennis
player to earn a spot on the pro tour. But his cocaine addiction
eroded everything else in his life. Other doctors and hospital
staffers were wary of him. His personal relationships would buckle
and break under the weight of his addiction. He came to loathe
himself each time he relapsed, allowing the disease to again
tighten like a vise.
</P>
<P>
   As the book begins, Smith is whisked from El Paso to an Atlanta
substance-abuse program designed specifically for doctors. Here,
Verghese succinctly details this dirty secret of the medical
profession _ drug- and alcohol-addled doctors. ``The very qualities
that led them to be doctors _ compulsiveness, conscientiousness,
control over emotions, delayed gratification, fantasies of the
future _ predisposed them to use drugs. When they did, ... when it
all came crashing down, what they felt was monstrous, crippling
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tennis court, and the simplicty of two friends chasing a
fuzzy yellow ball, allowed Smith and Verghese to hold their demons
at bay, and smooth, if temporarily, the harsh angles of their
lives. Between those clean white lines, Verghese and Smith seemed
to complete each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the way we controlled the movement of a yellow ball in
space, we were imposing order on a world that was fickle and
capricious,'' Verghese writes. ``Each time we played, this feeling
of restoring order, of mastery, was awakened.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, such moments were fleeting for Smith, whose slow,
incessant decline leads to the book's inevitable but utterly
shattering conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In his beautifully rendered first book, ``My Own Country,''
Verghese wrote of his experiences as a young doctor battling AIDS
in rural Tennessee. His elegant writing goes even deeper in ``The
Tennis Partner,'' which is both a love story and a horror story.
Verghese makes palpable his excitement at first connecting with
Smith, as well as his crushing frustration at his inability to save
David from himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his teacher and mentor, and on the tennis courts, he
fulfilled those roles for me. ... We had found a third arena
outside the defined boundaries of hospital and tennis court, found
it at a time in both our lives when friendship was an important way
to reclaim what had been lost. We had built it up, carefully, the
way boys fashion a sand castle with spades and buckets, ignoring
the rising tide. But it was not the tide that washed it away. David
knocked down his half.''

RETURN OF THE FOSSE RAZZLE DAZZLE

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They're all in black, from their top hats to their toes.
Fingers splayed, arms bent at acute angles, they writhe, slither,
and slide. One minute, they wriggle, sinuous as snakes; the next,
they freeze, limbs locked at impossible angles. Here's a drumroll,
a tip of a hat, a tap of a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's show time, folks!''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they give 'em the old razzle-dazzle in that
distinctive, inimitable way, there can be no doubt that the guiding
spirit has to be the late choreographer Bob Fosse. ``Everybody
knows the Bob Fosse silhouette; you can spot it a mile away,'' says
director Richard Maltby Jr. But in this case, the Fosse oeuvre is
hardly miles away. More than a decade after his death, in 1987 at
age 60, the choreographer is enjoying a posthumous comeback, a
curtain call that is arguably as splashy as the death dance he
staged in his semi-autobiographical film, ``All That Jazz.''
Revivals of such Fosse signature shows as ``Chicago'' and ``Sweet
Charity'' have met with critical and box-office success, and
theaters in New York and beyond are restaging lesser-known works
like ``Redhead'' and ``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance,'' an
ambitious retrospective that premiered in Toronto in July and opens
a three-week run in Boston Tuesday before moving to Los Angeles and
then Broadway. A corps of 36 dancers performs one knock-'em-dead
show stopper after another, ranging from the warm folksiness of
``Shoeless Joe From Hannibal, Mo.'' to the balletic grace of
``Crunchy Granola'' to the cool come-on of ``Steam Heat'' to the
driving beat of ``I Gotcha.'' In three hours, the encyclopedic show
spans four decades, with dances culled from Fosse's work in
theater, television, and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this work is dated,'' says Ann Rein-king, the dancer
who codirected the show with Maltby. ``It may come from a certain
era, but it's timeless.'' The retrospective is strictly dancing,
with no book or narration or any attempt to stage a Fosse
biography. (That's another story entirely.) It was initially
conceived a few years ago, when Fosse's onetime wife, dance legend
Gwen Verdon, and a Fosse dancer named Chet Walker started a
workshop in New York to teach the choreographer's style to young
hoofers. That informal effort led to the idea for a retrospective,
and the Toronto-based producing company Livent Inc. embraced the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the team brought in Maltby, who is best known for
his conception of ``Ain't Misbehavin','' the successful musical
tribute to Fats Waller. Maltby remembers traveling to Toronto
``basically to turn down the show,'' because he didn't want to
stage what he describes as ``a variation on an `And then I
choreographed ...' show, with narrative anecdotes and stuff.'' He
envisioned the celebration as an internally organized revue that
would capture the essence of Fosse without force-feeding the
audience biographical details and dates. Maltby shares conception
credit with Walker and Reinking, and Verdon is billed as artistic
adviser. ``I think of the show as a sort of aesthetic journey,''
Maltby says. ``It's certainly the journey of the heart of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   A complicated man, at that. Off stage, he was known as a
mercurial genius who could be both tender and tough,
self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing; his life has become the
stuff of backstage legend, particularly the stories about his
amorous adventures. In the studio, his work as a choreographer and
director is more often than not described as cool and detached,
sophisticated and sexy; in such works as ``Chicago'' and the film
version of ``Cabaret,'' he chronicled the seamy underside of
show-biz life, depicting the seductive yet destructive appeal of
glamour. He took a cold, calculated look at excess in the '70s and
'80s, long before such cynicism became fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   That cynicism is what some folks zoom in on when they think of
the Fosse ``style,'' associating the choreographer with a kind of
barren sexuality devoid of emotion. That infuriates his daughter
Nicole Fosse, who, along with her mother, Gwen Verdon, served as
consultant for the show. ``I want to clear up what hundreds of
people have been twisting around for years,'' she says. ``His work
explored relationships, politics, love, and sex, issues other
people didn't dare delve into at the time. But if nobody wanted to
see it, everything would have flopped, right? He was diving into
topics that made people tick, and that's what intrigued people
about his work.''
</P>
<P>
   A former dancer and mother of two (with a third child on the
way), Nicole Fosse alternately bristles and beams when she
discusses her father's work at a cast party immediately after the
opening in Toronto. ``I heard a woman at the performance today turn
to her husband and say, `Well, he certainly had a fixation on the
behind,''' she says, letting out a long whoop of a laugh. ``All
those dancers up there are actors. They're up there with political
ideas, with a life, with a story. They're complex human beings.
They're actors, and that's how Bob Fosse approached everything. It
was never just `Wiggle your behind' or `Shake bells on your
tush-ee.' If you really watch with an open-minded, intellectual
perspective, there is so much more up there. Am I being clear?''
</P>
<P>
   What's up there, Nicole Fosse, Reinking, and Maltby say, is the
spirit of a man who criticized society harshly but who embraced his
closest confidants tenderly. ``His work questions morality, big
time,'' says Reinking. ``He showed us the seduction of glamour and
how it can be a deadly thing.'' Reinking _ who lived with Fosse
after he and Verdon officially separated _ allows that the
choreographer did have a dark side, but insists that he also was
able to attain a certain lightness of being. ``He did have real
depression, and he did despair, but in spite of that, he couldn't
help coming up laughing and finding something that would touch him
dearly. And then he'd bounce back and go for it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The show aims to chronicle those times he went for it, to keep
the Fosse signature alive for generations to come. ``In the
theater, we're profligate with our artists,'' Maltby says. ``It's
not until about 10 years after a death that you realize what you've
lost. Fosse wasn't deified during his career. We got a Fosse show
every four or five years, which we could sneer at but privately
love. Now, we can feel his absence. There is a void, and this show
helps us realize what we have.'' The creators scoured film
libraries and archives to re-create works that had not been
documented, and part of the goal is to preserve the Fosse legacy.
``Dance is passed down person to person,'' Maltby says. The young
dancers will pass the tradition on, so that dancers who are only
toddlers today might look in the mirror someday in the future,
straighten their top hat, pull on their gloves, and say, ``It's
show time, folks!''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Louis Fosse was born in Chicago in 1927; his father, a
salesman who was also a vaudeville performer, prodded him onto the
stage. The young Fosse was working Chicago clubs by age 15 and he
stayed on stage until the day he died of a heart attack in 1987 on
a street in Washington, D.C., a few hours before his revival of
``Sweet Charity'' was set to open at the National Theatre.

 UNDATED: ... National Theatre.

<P>
   The choreographer had modest aspirations as a youth. ``All he
ever wanted to be was a nightclub performer,'' Maltby says. He did
a lot more than that over the years: He worked his way out of the
nightclubs and onto the Broadway stage, playing such roles as the
slick gigolo in ``Pal Joey'' and eventually turning to
choreography. The young hoofer who got his start in the clubs
eventually went on to win what show-biz folks refer to as the
triple crown: In 1973, he won the Oscar for ``Cabaret,'' the Tony
for ``Pippin,'' and the Emmy for the television special ``Liza With
a Z.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, of course, he developed that style. He once
claimed his distinctive look stemmed from an attempt to hide his
own deficiencies: ``I was getting pretty bald for a hoofer and felt
a hat would hide it. Canes became important to me when my hands
started trembling and seemed like a good way to distract the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 40-year career, he had a way of mixing modesty and
bravado. The 1979 film ``All That Jazz'' takes a scathing,
self-critical look at the life of an artist; his screen surrogate,
Joe Gideon, is a shameless womanizer who overdoes it when it comes
to work and women and overdoses when it comes to tobacco and drugs.
The character, whose only redeeming qualities are the brilliance of
his work and his fondness for his young daughter, literally drives
himself to death _ and then stages his own requiem, Broadway-style.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse, no doubt, took plenty of creative license with his own
life story. The film is utterly unforgiving of the Gideon
character, who maintains a working relationship with his dancer
wife while he lives with another dancer (played by Reinking). To
outsiders, it's astonishing that they all remained friends, but
they did and continue to work together to this day. Verdon and
Reinking are the closest of collaborators on ``Fosse.'' What about
normal human emotions, like jealousy and anger?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me,'' admits a perplexed Maltby. ``I haven't a
clue how they do it. They're all larger-than-life people who have
lived very complicated and fascinating lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdon scoffs at the public's fascination with those very
complicated lives. ``People are so in-trigued by sex, and I just
couldn't care less,'' she says. ``One person even said that Bob had
a voracious appetite, which makes him sound like a glutton. He
liked women. They're beautiful. But the women he knew, such as Ann
Reinking, were very bright women. They weren't just dumb dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismisses published accounts that recount his love affairs
with the zealousness of, say, an independent prosecutor. As for
``All That Jazz,'' she says, ``A true biography would have been
very boring. He had to make it theatrical.'' The real Bob Fosse,
she says, was ``your ordinary, everyday 9-to-5 guy'' who loved
sports and puttered around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Fosse says her father once told her the only true
relationship in the film is the touching one between the Joe Gideon
character and his daughter. ``Everybody loves sensationalism,'' she
says. ``Everyone in the line at the grocery store peeks at the
tabloids; they don't buy them but they peek. I'm not going to say
Bob Fosse was perfect and he was an angel, but who was? Look at
Balanchine. Does he have a perfect reputation? Look at Jerry
(Jerome) Robbins. Does he? Nobody has a perfect reputation, so
what's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   The man she wants people to see in the retrospective is the
father who once introduced her to Vivaldi by comparing his music to
Pink Floyd. She wants people to get a feel for the father she
danced for when she was a preteen and lived with for the first time
after he and her mother separated. At the time, he was working on
``Dancin','' the Broadway valentine to dancers that he
choreographed and directed in 1978. ``All of a sudden, he had this
prepubescent, exuberant child in his home,'' she recalls. ``I
wasn't jaded yet. Do you remember when you're just about to start
falling in love, and you can't stop talking and can't contain
yourself? I was as pure as could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer told her a story about an old man who loves to
dance but can't do it anymore, and he asked her to dance with him
as he played the old man. The father shuffled gingerly while the
daughter did the ballet version behind him. ``We stayed up all
night; he would do little bell kicks while I did big assembles,''
she says. That all-nighter eventually became ``Mr. Bojangles,'' a
sentimental number about what a dancer does when he can't dance
anymore. It's in the retrospective, a quiet, contemplative moment
in an otherwise rock-'em-sock-'em display of powerhouse numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Fosse says ``Bojangles'' makes her eyes go fuzzy every
time she sees it. As for her parents' unusual relationship, she
says, ``They had a child together. They worked brilliantly
together. You don't split that up. They were very sophisticated and
very honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Fosse, in fact, was adamant that the retrospective be
produced now, while her mother, who is 73, could still be a part of
the creative process. ``I knew at some point somebody was going to
do it,'' she says. ``It was inevitable. And it would have been nuts
to do it without the deep consultation of Gwen Verdon. You have to
have worked closely with Bob Fosse to understand him, and if you
lived with him, even better. Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking not only
worked with him many times, but they were also privy to his most
personal thoughts and feelings. He always used life as an integral
part of his work, and you can't separate the two. That's why you
cry. That's why you laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   So despite the unusual relationships of the collaborators, the
backstage drama associated with this show had nothing to do with
the Fosse family. The day after ``Fosse'' opened in Toronto, the
new management at Livent suspended its founders Garth Drabinsky and
Myron Gottlieb, citing ``ir-regularities'' in a financial audit.
Late last week, the company appointed Todd Haimes, currently
running New York's Roundabout Theatre Company, to the new position
of artistic director. Financial control of the prolific producing
company had been taken over by former Disney honcho Mike Ovitz and
investment banker Roy Furman in April.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Drabinsky and Gottlieb had been expected in
theater circles, and Verdon, for one, says the change doesn't worry
her. ``The show is too good,'' she says. ``They could put a gorilla
in there, and it would still go on. And Ovitz and Furman are both
very bright men. They're very secure about dollars and cents, and
Annie (Reinking) and I are very secure about good theater.''
</P>
<P>
   They've both starred in Fosse creations; Rein-king staged the
recent acclaimed tour of ``Chicago'' that played the Colonial last
year. They know the moves: the shoulder shimmies, the forward
struts, the shuffles and slides. This time they're tipping their
hats to the master himself, adding a touch of reverence to the
words Joe Gideon said so ironically in ``All That Jazz.'' You know
the rap by now: It's show time, folks.

<HEADLINE>
MOISES KAUFMAN'S TOP-GROSSING AMERICAN DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Moises Kaufman grew up in a household where they
discussed Spinoza over dinner and threw in a little Aristotle for
dessert. As a child in Caracas, Venezuela, he remembers being
encouraged to philosophize _ Please pass the Plato _ and to
investigate matters of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, there's no doubt that Kaufman would make the ideal dinner
guest, entertaining companions with a probing intelligence that is
seasoned with a dry, almost mischievous wit. But for all his
conversational skills, he still couldn't talk anyone into producing
his play, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'' when
he shopped it around a few years ago. He says he approached 37
producers, and 37 producers turned him down. And then he simply
mounted the play himself.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is the kind of story anyone who's ever
dreamed the impossible absolutely adores. Kaufman and his small
theater company, the Tectonic Theatre Project, scraped together
$15,000 to produce the play at a tiny theater in Greenwich Village.
With virtually no advertising, this play about the great Irish
dramatist by an unknown writer from Venezuela sold out every night.
Word spread. By the time the uptown critics heard of the production
(with the help of a clever letter that began, ``Pleading to Dear
Members of the Press''), Kaufman had proved all those producers
wrong. Since then, the New York production has moved twice to
larger houses, and it's still playing at the Minetta Lane Theater.
Another production is opening in London, and the play is making the
rounds on the regional theater circuit. The Huntington Theatre
Company production opens on Friday and runs through Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone wants to say they discovered the play before it
became successful. ``I think it reinforces something very profound
about the belief in the American Dream,'' Kaufman says. ``We love
seeing people succeed. We love it when, all of a sudden, this
little struggling theater company makes this incredible stride in
the world, because it allows us all to believe that it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman himself had no idea that he would embody the mythical
American Dream when a friend gave him a book called ``The Wit and
Wisdom of Oscar Wilde'' a few years back. He had read the
dramatist's greatest hits _ ``The Importance of Being Earnest,''
``An Ideal Husband.'' He knew the Irish writer had been tried on
charges of homosexual acts in Victorian England, but he didn't
realize that the dramatist had founded the aesthetic movement, that
he had embraced art as the only pure form of expression in a
changing world. The little book of quotes included transcripts from
Wilde's trials: The writer at first sued his lover's father, the
marquess of Queensbury, for slander and then ended up being tried
twice himself and convicted of ``gross indecency'' in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   The man who grew up contemplating Spinoza set off on a research
binge. He expected to come up with a definitive version of the
story, but like any good historian, he discovered varying degrees
of truth. ``The formal problem became, `How can theater reconstruct
history?' And then, of course, that leads to the bigger question,
`What is history?''' Kaufman says, echoing the thought. ``What is
history?''
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, he happened to be talking to a friend who
teaches history to high school students in the Bronx. The
adolescents were quite apathetic, so Kaufman's friend pushed them
to define history before they even started their studies. ``They
came up with a definition: History is a story told by people in
power, in the vocabulary of people in power, mostly about other
people in power,'' Kaufman explains. ``I like that definition
because it involves this idea of versions, and it resembles theater
very much because theater deals with people telling stories. So how
do you create a theatrical event that encompasses all those
versions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gross Indecency'' does exactly that. Nine male actors perform
in two playing areas. One is a platform that serves as the
courtroom, and the other is a table covered with research
materials. As the trials proceed, the actors read from the books
and articles, demonstrating the research process as the play is
performed. The audience gets to consider the various
interpretations from primary sources: Kaufman even writes himself
into the play, in a scene where the ``playwright'' discusses
Wilde's role as the first ``modern homosexual'' with a New York
University academic. ``That's because I'm an egomaniac,'' Kaufman
quips during a telephone interview, groaning as he hears the
computer keyboard constructing this sentence as he speaks. ``No, it
was a tongue-in-cheek thing. The play poses the question of how we
construct history, and the way we do that is the way we construct
identity and who we are in the larger context of the universe.
How's that for an answer?''
</P>
<P>
   The question of identity, of course, is at the core of
contemporary society, when hyphens and labels seem like inadequate
stand-ins for the larger issue of how we define ourselves in this
confusing, balkanized world. Kaufman has wrestled with that
question himself. The son of a Romanian-born father and a mother of
Ukrainian Jewish descent, he was raised in Venezuela speaking
Spanish, English, and Hebrew. But his confusion had nothing to do
with language. ``It had to do with growing up Jewish in a Catholic
country,'' he says. ``It had to do with growing up as a gay person
in a very heterosexual country. It had to do with having artistic
inclinations in a society that is very business-oriented. So there
was always the sense of being `The Other.' I've been an outsider
all of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His father owned a food business, and his mother was
vice-president of a bank. Despite their business acumen, at home
they encouraged their three children to discuss the classics the
way other families contemplate the weather or neighborhood gossip.
``My dinner conversations were about Spinoza,'' Kaufman says,
laughing as he hears the keyboard click-clacking on the other end
of the line. ``I know, I know, I know, it sounds absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he explains that his father survived the Holocaust in
Romania and fled to Paris after World War II. He contracted
tuberculosis and ended up in a Parisian hospital for a year. ``He
asked the nurse to go to the library and bring him books, starting
with the letter A,'' Kaufman says. ``When he got out of the
hospital after a year, people couldn't believe the way he spoke, in
this beautifully florid literary manner, with all these references
to the obscurest of works by the most famous of writers. In a
sense, World War II made me an artist, because it gave him the
knowledge that instilled in me this intellectual rigor and
appetite. Growing up, there wasn't a lot of stimulation outside the
house, but inside, there was a very rich and fertile ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish family practiced religion inside the house, but
appeared secular in the outside world. ``It's funny, there's
something about Judaism that says you can be Jews at home but not
outside. Needless to say, that comes in very handy when you're
gay.'' A pause and a laugh. ``I should tell them that! Mom, Dad, I
can't thank you enough for teaching me to be in the closet!''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman did have a coming out scene back home in Caracas, and he
came to terms with his sexuality when he moved to New York in 1987
to study directing at New York University. His voice does a sort of
verbal twitch when he recalls telling his family he is gay . ``I
got a range of reactions, from `It doesn't matter,' to `This is
going to be hard for me,' to cries and hugs and kisses,'' he says.
``It's very interesting that the one thing all gay people have in
common is a history of coming out. On a personal level, there is a
history of this event that we all share, and that is a beautiful
notion.''
</P>
<P>
   His subject, Oscar Wilde, shares that history, too. Kaufman is
particularly fond of a scene in ``Gross Indecency'' when Wilde
tells his friend and biographer, Frank Harris, that the charges
against him are true. Wilde asks his friend whether that revelation
matters, and Harris thinks about it before answering, ``No.
Curiously enough it has made no difference to me at all. I do not
know why... but it has no effect on my friendship, none upon my
resolve to help you.'' In a few short sentences, Harris moves from
dismay to tolerance. ``I always tell the actor playing that role
that between finding out until the minute he says, `No,' he has to
travel a hundred years,'' says Kaufman, who directed the original
production. ``He has to come to this part of the century where he
can make that discrimination: `It doesn't matter. I don't know why,
but it doesn't matter.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey that Kaufman has traveled himself, from his own
coming out scene to the day he told his father he wanted to be an
artist, not a businessman. In Moises Kaufman's version of history,
it all worked out splendidly. His life has changed since three
dozen or so producers rejected his script. He's had offers to write
the film version of ``Gross Indecency.'' He's off to London to
direct the British premiere of the play. He's toiling away on his
next script: ``It's a secret. There has to be some mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``little struggling theater company'' isn't struggling so
hard anymore. ``All of a sudden, we don't have to be thinking where
the next meal is coming from, and all of a sudden, this theater
company is talking to a much larger audience,'' he says. ``But you
want to hear what has been the best part of all? I have been able
to engage in dialogue with people I've admired for a long time. I
think of Paris at the turn of the century, where there were these
salons where... artists would get together and their views of the
changing world would collide and something would happen. Now, with
all this success and publicity, I'm able to talk with people I've
wanted to dialogue with forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's as if he's back at that dinner table, talking about Spinoza
or whatever with colleagues like Tony Kushner, Larry Kramer or Mike
Nichols, to name a few. The success of the thinking man's play has
also reassured him that other like-minded people crave intelligent
discourse. ``It's a great revelation because it means to me that
people want to be talked to intelligently about things they care
about,'' Kaufman explains. ``And in a sense, that has made me feel
more of a part of the human race. I never felt that way before.''
He pauses and laughs at the weight of that statement. ``How's that
for an ending?''

   CLINTON-POLL (Washington) _ A bipartisan poll shows the Monica
Lewinsky matter has taken its toll on President Clinton and
Democrats. Among the findings: ``Moral values'' are now up there
with crime and the economy as leading issues, Clinton's personal
approval has dropped 19 percentage points since the beginning of
the year, and Republicans are up 3 points over Democrats in
congressional races. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ When Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn,
condemned President Clinton's immoral behavior, he joined a small
band of senators who over the decades have shown the courage and
integrity to defy their party's leaders on a matter of principle.
It's a very small band indeed, but it includes Sens. Mark Hatfield,
Howard Baker, William Fulbright and Margaret Chase Smith, all
heroes worth remembering. By MARIANNE MEANS.

REPETITIVE STRESS DISORDERS AFFLICTING MORE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ABBY FUNG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - Sewell Chan, 21, had dreamed of becoming a journalist
for as long as he could remember and was heartbroken this spring
when he had to turn down a summer internship at the Washington Post
because his wrists throbbed with pain whenever he tried to type.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in his senior year at Harvard, Chan began feeling a
tingling sensation in his forearms every time he typed, took notes,
or edited the school paper. It turned out he had repetitive stress
injury, or RSI, a catch-all term covering tendinitis, carpal tunnel
syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and more, in which muscles,
tendons, and nerves are damaged through excessive typing and bad
posture.
</P>
<P>
   Once an affliction mainly of veteran office workers, RSI is
quickly becoming more and more a problem for today's college
students, who grow up playing Atari and Nintendo, endlessly write
papers and theses on their home computers, and surf the Internet or
check their e-mail ``for relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no national statistics available, but a survey of
colleges reveals that RSI is afflicting students at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Medical Center said he has treated more than 1,500 RSI patients
over the past eight years, with each year's toll growing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 350 RSI patients visited the MIT Medical Center. On
average, 200 students at the school seek help for the syndrome each
year. At a school with 8,000 students, 1 in 40, suffers from RSI,
Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are also high at Harvard University. Seven years
ago, there were only two cases of RSI, according to Louise Russell,
director of Harvard's student disabilities resources center. Last
year, more than 100 were reported. Russell said she has seen the
number shoot up dramatically in the past three years, due to
increased awareness and an ``increasingly competitive academic
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Moore, student health physician at the University of
Virginia, said he sees two or three RSI patients per semester. Jane
Austin, a physical therapist at the University of Nebraska in
Lincoln, diagnoses two to three cases of RSI each month, and Alan
Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University in Ithaca,
N.Y., said 1 in 5 students, out of 104 randomly selected
undergraduates, reported persistent wrist pain in an April survey.
Hedge said he plans to expand the survey to 1,000 students soon.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond said RSI used to afflict mainly middle-aged workers
``who do forceful repetitive motions with the wrist.'' But with the
proliferation of home computers, some members of the generation
born in the 1970s began typing practically as soon as they could
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Baratunde Thurston, 20, is a prime example. A self-described
``information freak,'' the Harvard senior says he began playing
with computers when he was 6 years old. ``The message you get is
that you have to be computer-literate when you're 6 years old or
you're going to be a bum when you grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thurston can no longer scoop ice cream, hold dining
hall trays, or ride his bike (because gripping the handlebars has
become too painful), he still works as a computer user assistant,
helping students set up their computers and solve computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Allmon, a 21-year-old Harvard senior, sleeps with
wrist braces and has spent more than $500 on acupuncture,
chiropractic treatment, and massage.
</P>
<P>
   Universities have been forced to respond to the pleas for help
from students like Thurston and Allmon. Diamond, of MIT, said
booklets on how to prevent RSI fill the mailboxes of all incoming
freshmen, and posters about it pepper the campus kiosks. Russell,
of Harvard, said that mouse pads in the computer lab have been
redesigned to provide information on how to prevent RSI, and
adjustable chairs and keyboard trays are available in student
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, professor Hedge at Cornell has created a Web site
(http://ergo.human.cornell.edu) to teach students how to RSI-proof
their computer workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Some students say that's not enough. ``The desks are too high or
the chairs are too low,'' Thurston said of his dorm. ``But it would
cost way too much money for them to replace it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thurston said, he warns classmates about RSI. ``People
really take typing and mousework for granted,'' he said. ``They
don't think they're going to injure themselves because they're just
typing, but they will.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase awareness of the problem, Thurston became part of a
group called RSI Action, which was formed at Harvard a few years
ago. The group takes credit for introducing RSI-preventive mouse
pads and for convincing computer labs to post warning signs about
RSI.
</P>
<P>
   Allmon says he has become a one-man warning network. ``I nag
everyone about posture and typing and taking breaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speech-recognition software companies are also responding to the
needs of the students.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Blodgett, manager of corporate communications at Dragon
Systems Inc. in Newton, is in charge of marketing Dragon Dictate
and Dragon Naturally Speaking, speech recognition software that
Thurston and Allmon use to ``write'' their papers. They speak into
a microphone, and the computer translates the words on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The software is now marketed to doctors, lawyers, and business
executives, but Blodgett said college students with RSI represent
``an untapped market.'' Although she has no figures on the number
of RSI patients who purchase speech recognition software, Blodgett
said, ``There's a lot of people using it for that purpose.''

Times News Service for Wednesday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-CROWDED-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ Short of pointing a
telescope through your neighbor's window, few experiences offer
better access to the intimate details of strangers' lives than
dining in Manhattan restaurants. Who hasn't had the pleasure of
being squeezed onto a narrow banquette where the tables are too
close for comfort? Your mind may be on your companion across from
you, but you cannot avoid being distracted by the couples sitting
on either side. You overhear their conversations, you inhale their
perfume, you can almost taste their food. With rents soaring and
restaurants booming, restaurateurs feel justified squeezing in an
extra table or two _ even if it meansthe difference between
convivial and claustrophobic. A critic's notebook by Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   TEQUILA (Tequila, Mexico) _ Was it a mirage? In the sultry
95-degree heat, the fields shimmered along the highway leading from
Guadalajara, as if the hazy blue sky had tumbled to the earth and
splashed over the hillsides. But the fields really were blue,
covered with acres of steely agave plants, the raw ingredient for
one of the world's most popular spirits _ tequila. By Florence
Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-FAT (Louviers, France) _ A gray cloud is passing over the
traditional French dietary regimen: the French are gaining weight,
if statistics are to be believed. And if you ask anyone from the
country's top epidemiologists to starred chefs to the local grocer,
they all point to the west, the U.S.A., the country the French love
and hate the most. By Susan Herrmann Loomis.
</P>
<P>

Help is at hand. First Sip, a new monthly wine newsletter, not only

INTERNET COMPANIES RIDE OUT STORMS WITH EYE TO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They're the Beanie Babies of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based companies like Amazon.com, GeoCities and
Broadcast.com mimic the little stuffed toys in a key assumption:
They make money now only because enough people agree that they will
be a valued collectible down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell the future,'' said Stuart Skorman, founder of
Reel.Com, a Berkeley-based video retailer that is expected to go
public soon. ``Internet companies don't make money. In fact,
they're expected to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Skorman and analysts who watch over this
hyperactive segment of the economy, Internet-based companies are
burning up investor dollars to become a familiar destination and
brand name when the big ``future'' hits: A marketing nirvana where
consumers make instant impulse buys from their couches while
sitting in the glow of their hybrid TV/computer information
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that last week's stock market turmoil means
there are some dangerous curves on the road to Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a crisis comes, selling a piece of the future is not as
valuable as selling a piece of the present,'' said Paul
Sonderegger, a senior analyst at the Massachusetts-based Forrester
Research. ``Suddenly, reality sets in, and investors realize that
they can't put food on the table now with hopes for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reality that can seriously disrupt an Internet company's
current march into this future.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, because they have little or no present
streams of revenues, depend upon investor dollars to pay the bills.
A company creates a serious mountain of cash when they put their
stocks up for sale on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the Seattle-based on-line bookstore, generated $54
million with its initial public offering, or IPO.
</P>
<P>
   A company's fluctuating stock price doesn't affect that first
flush of money. But a company's stock market price is crucial to
the company's ability to exist in the future, enabling it to buy
other companies, offer incentives to current and future employees
and raise more to cover continued losses. All of which are at the
heart of the business plan of most Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundations of these companies are future investor
dollars, employee retention and company acquisitions,'' said Dave
Jones, an analyst with the California Technology Stock Newsletter.
``And a company's stock price is central to these foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   The quandary of Internet stocks is that they confound current
analysis. Traditionally, a stock's worth was derived by formulas
such as the price/earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Such formulas collapse with an Internet company that has little
or no earnings. Analysts spend their days trying to determine what
an Internet company might make if the Internet itself eventually
takes off as a mass medium, and users embrace on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's assumption on assumption on assumption,'' Jones said.
``When you have one part of those formulas go out of whack, like a
stock's unusual drop, the whole thing can come caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said sustained hits on an Internet company's stock price
can force it out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got certain stock price numbers built into their
business plans,'' he said. ``And they're usually planning to go
back to the equities (stock market) for funding in the future. If
their prices are way down, that destroys their models. They have to
make it up somewhere else, or close their doors.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes Internet companies such a volatile
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional companies having hard times with their stocks can
always show investors recent sales numbers or things like that,''
Jones said. ``Right now, the only thing Internet companies have are
predictions. And the way things are going these days, predictions
aren't worth that much.''

SLEUTH PROBES BATTLE OF SEXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
The Last Manly Man 
Sparkle Hayter (William Morrow and Co., $22) 
 
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As modern fictional sleuths go, none is more fun to spend time
with than Robin Hudson, a reporter for the New York-based All News
Network whose life is just one damn thing after another.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Sparkle Hayter, a former reporter for CNN who
also has done stand-up comedy, Robin has to solve murders while
evading the back-stabbing antics of co-workers, figuring out what
life is all about, mollifying stupid superiors, and securing her
share of physical romance without becoming a casualty in the battle
of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Last Manly Man,'' Robin is again beset by complexities
that would test the resources of Indiana Jones or Brenda Starr.
</P>
<P>
   She's having a hard enough time trying to report a story on the
Man of the Future, a look at how far men (that's  &UR; men, not mankind)
have come and what they might evolve into.
</P>
<P>
   Then she gets caught up in the investigation of the kidnapping
of a bunch of bonobo chimpanzees and the efforts of a shadowy
organization of animal activists (who also want to save indigenous
peoples, rain forests, etc., etc.) to free the chimps.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of figuring out who's doing what to whom, Robin
has to deal with an animal-rights activist who spends most of his
time in drag, a laid-back marijuana dealer who's dating his
ex-wife, and her gun-toting downstairs neighbor, Mrs. Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Robin, a divorced woman with a cat who once had a lucrative
career in cat-food commercials, is determinedly
non-politically-correct. She loves red meat, men and looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, her unrestrained personality makes it
possible for her to both poke fun at and sympathize with the
save-the-world types with whom she joins forces.
</P>
<P>
   In her previous adventures, Robin spent plenty of brain time
trying to make sense of the personal fascination and frustration
she feels in dealing with men. In ``The Last Manly Man,'' she
pushes her intellectual inquiry to a global level while continuing
to provide healthy doses of hell raising and hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to laugh your way to a better understanding of what
men and women are all about these days, you should spend some time
with ``The Last Manly Man.'' &QL;

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that school's back in session, it's time to hit the books.
</P>
<P>
   Creatures such as ants and spotted yellow frogs will entertain
preschoolers. A novel about two pen pals and an adventure story
about what it's like to climb Mount Everest will appeal to older
children. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SPOTTED YELLOW FROGS &QL; 
 &UR; Matthew Van Fleet (Dial, $9.99)
</P>
<P>
   Wow! This book has it all: colors, patterns, animals and
three-dimensional shapes such as pyramids, cubes, cylinders, cones
and rings that usually are not taught in books for tykes. The
colorful patterns on one page are clues about which animal lurks
behind each geometric shape on the next fold-out page. When your
preschooler masters that game, fold out the final page, which asks
kids to identify the  &UR; wrong patterns on eight animals scampering
among dozens illustrated correctly. It'll keep your little one
plenty busy. For ages 2 to 4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHERE DO I LIVE? &QL; 
 &UR; World Wildlife Fund (Cedco, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Red Fox. I hunt for rodents, birds, and sometimes
frogs. I hide in dark, safe places. Where do I live?'' Across the
page is a portrait of an adorable fox. Lift the flap to reveal the
fox in its natural surroundings, along with the answer: a forest.
So goes this educational picture book, which also features a polar
bear, an angelfish, a gorilla, a zebra, a pelican, a sea star and
more.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wildlife Fund continues to publish breathtaking nature
photography for kids in its fall offerings. Other titles are ``Look
Who's Hatching!'', a compendium of eggs and baby animals, and
``Habitats: A Sticker Activity Book.'' For ages 2 to 5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HEY, LITTLE ANT &QL; 
 &UR; Phillip and Hannah Hoose; illustrated by Debbie Tilley (Tricycle
Press,
 &UR; $13.95)
</P>
<P>
   To squish or not to squish? That is the question posed in this
morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a great big kid who's about to flatten an ant
with his tennis shoe. The ant, holding two shopping bags, takes on
human dimensions as it pleads for its life. It's got a home and a
family to feed, too. As the big kid's buddies urge him to squish, a
sudden role reversal occurs. The ant grows tall and the boy shrinks
to antlike size. After a turn in the ant's shoes, the kid thinks
again. What do you think he should do?
</P>
<P>
   Told in rhyme with amusing illustrations, this book from a
Buddhist publishing house is a good starting point for discussing
the value of life. For ages 3 to 5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; COYOTE IN LOVE WITH A STAR &QL; 
 &UR; Marty Kreipe de Montano; illustrated by Tom Coffin (Abbeville
Press, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix artist Coffin, a Kansas native and member of the Prairie
Band Potawatomi and Creek tribes, pens the whimsical illustrations
in this tale about a coyote who moves from the plains to New York
City. In his VW bus, coyote negotiates the bustling urban streets
(lined with signs such as ``Cuban Chinese food'') and gets himself
a job as the rodent control officer for the World Trade Center.
There, he stargazes at night, eventually falling for a special star
that takes him on a wild dance to the edge of the sky. De Montano
put this modern spin on a traditional Native American story.
</P>
<P>
   The title is among several in the ``Tales of the People''
series, published in partnership with the Smithsonian's National
Museum of the American Indian. The picture books are written and
illustrated by Native Americans. For ages 4 to 8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HOME RUN: THE STORY OF BABE RUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Robert Burleigh; illustrated by Mike Wimmer (Harcourt Brace, $16)
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth died 50 years ago, but his legacy lives on in this
old-fashioned picture book about one of the greatest players who
ever lived. Wimmer's paintings, in the realistic style of Norman
Rockwell, capture the action of Babe at bat and his fans'
amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh writes in free verse, giving the game a poetic quality:
``He watches the pitcher lean. Rotate. Rock back and forth. The leg
wheels out. The arm whips over the head. Babe narrows his
hunter-like gaze and strides into the pitch that is now only a tiny
speck of whirling whiteness.'' Baseball cards on each page add
facts and figures that will interest older readers. For ages 4 to
8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE ENCHANTED TREE &QL; 
 &UR; Flavia and Lisa Weedn (Cedco Publishing, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   Flavia, of inspirational greeting-card fame, and her daughter
have written and illustrated four children's books to be released
Sept. 15. The pictures are beautiful, and production is top-notch.
Story lines center on values of friendship, love, sharing and
kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Enchanted Tree'' is about a tall, pink giraffe that
doesn't care for its looks and wants to be like everyone else. It
leaves its village, and on its journey meets a wise tree that
teaches it that individuality is a gift and that each of us is
perfect just as we are. Other titles in the series are ``The
Elephant Prince,'' ``The Little Snow Bear'' and ``The Star Gift.''
For ages 4 to 8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; P.S. LONGER LETTER LATER &QL; 
 &UR; Paula Danziger and Ann M. Martin (Scholastic, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and TaraStarr (she uses a star in her name, of course)
are friends, like the writers who created them, Danziger (best
known as the creator of the Amber Brown novels) and Martin (of the
Baby-Sitters Club). When Tara moves away with her family, she and
Elizabeth continue their close relationship through correspondence
that reveals their contrasting personality traits, modeled on those
of the book's authors.
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing exchange is a clever vehicle for covering the
concerns of pre-adolescence: peer-group acceptance, school
challenges, geeky parents and those awful but exciting parties.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth comes from monied parents who lose everything when
Dad's employment abruptly ends. (``Dad said something about a
package. Do they give going-away presents to people they fire?''
asks Elizabeth.) Tara writes condescendingly of her ``charents (my
CHildlike pARENTS),'' who are young and not so well off
financially. But she realizes how lucky she is to live in a loving
home. Great friends, fun book. For ages 8 to 12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WITHIN REACH: MY EVEREST STORY &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Pfetzer and Jack Galvin (Dutton, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   Pfetzer was on Mount Everest just below the summit when a
terrible storm struck, causing one of the worst disasters in the
mountain's history. Eight people perished, and their ordeal became
the basis of the bestselling adult book ``Into Thin Air'' and an
IMAX film, ``Everest.'' What was a 16-year-old kid doing there, a
few steps from death?
</P>
<P>
   Pfetzer, the youngest person to attempt Everest, describes the
perilous night of May 10, 1996, and his nine other climbs of the
world's highest peaks. He also talks about becoming a karate black
belt at age 11, a certified emergency medical technician at age 17,
and his ambition to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   His determination will inspire children and dumbfound adults.
The first-person narrative is heavy on action but light on insight
about the forces driving Pfetzer's relentless climb to achieve. For
ages 10 and up. &QL;

OPINIONATED DUO SERVE UP BEST SELECTIONS FOR YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a book for a child can be an intimidating process, with
an overwhelming number to choose from, uncertainties about what is
age-appropriate, and chagrin over price tags. Even choosing a free
library book can be a daunting experience.
</P>
<P>
   Help has arrived. Valerie V. Lewis and Walter M. Mayes have
narrowed the possibilities to a mere 2,000 titles in their new
``Valerie &AMP; Walter's Best Books for Children: A Lively, Opinionated
Guide,'' published by Avon Books for $15.
</P>
<P>
   Their selections neatly are cataloged for easy reference,
according to age and reading and listening levels. An index even
groups titles according to topics and themes, such as trains,
stepfamilies, emotions, fear of the dark and woodchucks.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a section called ``tricky situations and frequently
asked questions.'' Sidebars and inspirational tips on such subjects
as choosing a book, series fiction, exceptional authors and
literary classics are interspersed.
</P>
<P>
   The one-paragraph book summaries are done in an amusing style.
When Valerie and Walter agree that a book is the best of the best,
a star is printed next to the title. When they disagree, each one
weighs in with a few comments, a la Siskel and Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selections aren't included in the guide unless
Valerie and Walter believe in their merit, every now and then they
raise an eyebrow, as in this passage about H.A. Rey's ``Curious
George'':
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not wish to be curmudgeonly, but we need to say that
much of George's appeal is lost on us as adults. Oh, we read them
as children and later to our own children, and we acknowledge the
fact that they delight. But we are at a loss to explain why they
are popular. Is it just that George embodies curiosity so well? Is
it a nostalgia for simpler times, perhaps, when a man in a big
yellow hat taking a monkey from the jungle could be looked upon
fondly and not as a poacher? Or is it that George is simply
beloved, period, and we just don't get it? Do not let us stop you
from making up your own mind, as there is certainly plenty of
George to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you feel like you know and trust the two
knowledgeable characters who tackled this massive project (their
original list of titles topped 8,000).
</P>
<P>
   Mayes, also known as Walter the Giant Storyteller, is a
book-sales representative who talks nationwide with parents and
kids about books. Lewis, owner of Hickelbee's children's bookstore
in San Jose, is children's book correspondent for ``CBS This
Morning.'' They've worked together since 1981, and their
comfortable writing style reflects the friendship. &QL;

   ANCHOVY, Jamaica _ About 30 minutes into a bumpy drive along a
road with crater-sized potholes, you finally begin seeing signs.
They have no words, only pictures of birds and arrows leading
travelers atop a wooded hill 900 feet above the waters of Montego
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That's where you find the Rocklands Feeding Station, one of the
Caribbean's most unusual attractions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it looks like nothing but an unassuming stone house
with a green roof on a verdant plot of land.
</P>
<P>
   But off to the side, in the shade of a small terrace, a show is
about to begin, and hushed onlookers from all parts of the world
are ready to see it. Armed with cameras, they are perched on
rickety folding chairs.
</P>
<P>
   They don't wait long because soon a flock of greedy,
lightning-fast birds that include saffron finches and blue tanagers
descends on the terrace, ready for food.
</P>
<P>
   Birds with spectacular colors, but not such good manners, whiz
about the heads of visitors like miniature flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, the hummingbirds drink from hand-held bottles
of sugar water, and the tiny finches flutter around outstretched
palms packed full of birdseed.
</P>
<P>
   Others just eat off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't do the sun and the surf thing, so I do the bird
thing, and this is certainly the best place to be if you want to
interact with birds,'' said Janis Gaudy, a tourist from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   A pleased Gaudy holds out some food and attracts a black
hummingbird with an iridescent emerald throat. Her reaction? That
she's made a new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is the largest English-speaking country in the
Caribbean, 146 miles from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are three main tourist destinations -- Montego Bay,
Ocho Rios and Negril -- all boasting a plethora of all-inclusive
resorts along stunning coasts.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone enjoys powdery sands, crystal-clear waters, and
acting out Jacques Cousteau fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Off the beaten track are all sorts of other activities to keep
tourists busy and happy, everything from horseback riding to
mountain hiking to bicycle riding.
</P>
<P>
   And, most especially, birdwatching.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Salmon, a native Jamaican, opened the Rocklands Feeding
Station in 1958. Today, at age 94, Salmon still lives on the
property, although she's mostly confined to bed. The eccentric
proprietor never married and considers the birds to be her only
family.
</P>
<P>
   Her employees open the sanctuary each day from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
and charges visitors $8 to feed the wild birds. The site is located
just a few miles from Montego Bay, on the northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa's the one who got the birds to start coming here,'' said
Daisy Morrison, who's worked at Rocklands for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would go day after day into the forest to try to feed the
birds,'' she said. ``She would bring the birds closer by feeding
them nearer to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary sits on about 2 1/4 acres of forested land and is
surrounded by virtual clouds of birds: grassquits, finches, and,
most importantly, hummingbirds. There's the mango, the
streamertail, and the vervain, the second-smallest bird on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Birds flit back and forth across the terrace, which is
pleasantly cluttered by ferns, and various tropical plants.
</P>
<P>
   They pause mid-flight, just momentarily, to take a sip of sugar
water from small bottles that hang on wires from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The birds -- even wild canaries -- don't seem to be afraid of
anything, and certainly not a stranger's extended finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing how they will come to you,'' said Doreen
Mensink, a tourist from Holland. ``I've not seen anything quite
like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   But besides Rocklands, there are many other places to see birds
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular are the forest-blanketed Blue Mountains, a central
range that bisects the island east to west, where more than 250
species of birds -- some found nowhere else on the island -- might
be spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountains National Park is Jamaica's largest, covering
some 200,000 acres. Among the native birds are the vervain
hummingbird, the rare Jamaican blackbird, and the Jamaican tody,
one of only a few birds which goes underground to make its nest.
Butterfly enthusiasts are drawn to the mountains in search of the
giant swallowtail butterfly, with its wingspan of six inches,
that's only found there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3,000 feet up, the Blue Mountain coffee region starts.
Here the mountains are dotted with small plantations producing some
of the world's best coffee. And some of the most expensive. In the
United States, a pound sells for $35 to $40.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountains are the starting point for numerous hiking
trails leading to waterfalls and spectacular mountain vistas. Blue
Mountain Peak rises to 7,402 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jamaica has a bounty of other natural wonders to
pursue, from the three-mile Fern Gully, home to 550 species of
fern, to the Hope Botanical Gardens, at the foot of the Blue
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the island's plant species are native, earning it
the rank of fifth in the world for the most endemic plant species.
</P>
<P>
   You can take guided boat excursions up the Black River, one of
Jamaica's longest and largest rivers, or drop by the Crystal
Springs park near Port Antonio, where there are more than 15,000
varieties of plants and one of the largest orchid collections in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   You can climb the ``Niagara of the Caribbean,'' Dunn's River
Falls in Ocho Rios, which is over 600 feet high, or hike in the Rio
Grande Valley, where you'll find waterfalls, streams, and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica's a lot more than the beaches,'' said Sam McCook,
spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board. ``There is a lot of
natural beauty here.''

   WHEN TO GO:
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is a year-round destination, although the peak season,
when hotel prices are higher, is between mid-December and
mid-April. It's hot in the summer, but you'll get better bargains
by traveling then.

Kingston from U.S. gateways that include Atlanta, Chicago and
Miami. Call 1-800-523-5585 for reservations. Once you get to
Jamaica, taxis are plentiful, but not cheap. A driver will charge
about $150 to $200 to take tourists from Kingston to Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   Options range from small cottages to huge all-inclusive resorts.

   KUWAIT CITY _ With candor and a little embarrassment, Kuwaitis
talk about taxi drivers with maids and middle-class families with
six or seven cars.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with their country, they readily admit, is that
Cadillacs came into favor and work went out of style.
</P>
<P>
   My recent trip to Kuwait started with the government insisting
that it would pay all my bills for lodging, meals and laundry. I
declined.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with a hotel official giving me a souvenir that
explained the comforts I'd seen -- a Plexiglas cube with a few
drops of shiny black oil swishing around in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait used to be poor. Now, it sits on about 10 percent of the
world's oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 1.8 million people in Kuwait, and only about
700,000 are Kuwaitis. The rest are foreign workers, who do jobs
from housekeeping to car sales to stock brokering.
</P>
<P>
   You can spot Kuwaiti men by their red-and-white head scarfs and
flowing white robes. But mostly you see Indians, Sri Lankans,
Iranians and Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's per capita income in 1995 ranked third in the world,
still behind the United States. But the oil has created what many
describe as a rich ``welfare state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis pay no income tax. Education is free through college.
Utilities are heavily subsidized. Health-care is free. House loans
are low-interest. Land, in some areas, is free.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman(CQ) Mutawa, a former government minister and economist,
explained that words like ``unemployment'' and ``rich and poor'' do
not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my income is $1,500 a month, but I can buy a Mercedes on
installments, what do you call me?'' he asked. ``Our existence is
based on subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis like big American cars _ a favorite is the Chevrolet
Caprice Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods are built on the desert sand. Large villas are
pushed close together and usually sprout two satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no public bars or public consumption of alcohol in
this Muslim country, but I found a spotless bowling alley that
featured an Internet computer room. And Kuwaitis were happy to
invite me to their nightly salon discussions.
</P>
<P>
   There are, indeed, poor in Kuwait. Some foreign workers live in
crowded apartment blocks and there is an ethnic group of some
100,000 people claiming citizenship but not getting it and not
being allowed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait is also tough on women. They are not forced to wear head
scarves or prohibited from driving as in Saudi Arabia, but they
cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on Kuwaiti democracy caused some to complain about
the U.S. efforts to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion. Amnesty International says Kuwait holds
more than 100 political prisoners accused of collaborating with the
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait does have a parliament, even if the ultimate decisions
are made by the royal family. It's what you might call a
semi-democracy.
</P>
<P>
   People discuss politics openly, as long as they do not criticize
the royal family directly, and the hospitable, soft-spoken Kuwaiti
nature is easy on a foreign traveler. They like, and in many ways,
resemble Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But, the good times might not last. Slumping oil prices have the
Kuwaiti government in deficit spending and there's talk about
cutting the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they can already see the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the people here,'' said one young Kuwaiti man,
gesturing around a crowded mall that boasts stores by Laura Ashley,
Godiva and Gucci. ``How many people are carrying (shopping) bags?
They are just walking around!''

   ANCHOVY, Jamaica _ About 30 minutes into a bumpy drive along a
road with crater-sized potholes, you finally begin seeing signs.
They have no words, only pictures of birds and arrows leading
travelers atop a wooded hill 900 feet above the waters of Montego
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That's where you find the Rocklands Feeding Station, one of the
Caribbean's most unusual attractions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it looks like nothing but an unassuming stone house
with a green roof on a verdant plot of land.
</P>
<P>
   But off to the side, in the shade of a small terrace, a show is
about to begin, and hushed onlookers from all parts of the world
are ready to see it. Armed with cameras, they are perched on
rickety folding chairs.
</P>
<P>
   They don't wait long because soon a flock of greedy,
lightning-fast birds that include saffron finches and blue tanagers
descends on the terrace, ready for food.
</P>
<P>
   Birds with spectacular colors, but not such good manners, whiz
about the heads of visitors like miniature flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, the hummingbirds drink from hand-held bottles
of sugar water, and the tiny finches flutter around outstretched
palms packed full of birdseed.
</P>
<P>
   Others just eat off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't do the sun and the surf thing, so I do the bird
thing, and this is certainly the best place to be if you want to
interact with birds,'' said Janis Gaudy, a tourist from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   A pleased Gaudy holds out some food and attracts a black
hummingbird with an iridescent emerald throat. Her reaction? That
she's made a new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is the largest English-speaking country in the
Caribbean, 146 miles from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are three main tourist destinations -- Montego Bay,
Ocho Rios and Negril -- all boasting a plethora of all-inclusive
resorts along stunning coasts.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone enjoys powdery sands, crystal-clear waters, and
acting out Jacques Cousteau fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Off the beaten track are all sorts of other activities to keep
tourists busy and happy, everything from horseback riding to
mountain hiking to bicycle riding.
</P>
<P>
   And, most especially, birdwatching.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Salmon, a native Jamaican, opened the Rocklands Feeding
Station in 1958. Today, at age 94, Salmon still lives on the
property, although she's mostly confined to bed. The eccentric
proprietor never married and considers the birds to be her only
family.
</P>
<P>
   Her employees open the sanctuary each day from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
and charges visitors $8 to feed the wild birds. The site is located
just a few miles from Montego Bay, on the northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa's the one who got the birds to start coming here,'' said
Daisy Morrison, who's worked at Rocklands for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would go day after day into the forest to try to feed the
birds,'' she said. ``She would bring the birds closer by feeding
them nearer to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary sits on about 2 1/4 acres of forested land and is
surrounded by virtual clouds of birds: grassquits, finches, and,
most importantly, hummingbirds. There's the mango, the
streamertail, and the vervain, the second-smallest bird on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Birds flit back and forth across the terrace, which is
pleasantly cluttered by ferns, and various tropical plants.
</P>
<P>
   They pause mid-flight, just momentarily, to take a sip of sugar
water from small bottles that hang on wires from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The birds -- even wild canaries -- don't seem to be afraid of
anything, and certainly not a stranger's extended finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing how they will come to you,'' said Doreen
Mensink, a tourist from Holland. ``I've not seen anything quite
like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   But besides Rocklands, there are many other places to see birds
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular are the forest-blanketed Blue Mountains, a central
range that bisects the island east to west, where more than 250
species of birds -- some found nowhere else on the island -- might
be spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountains National Park is Jamaica's largest, covering
some 200,000 acres. Among the native birds are the vervain
hummingbird, the rare Jamaican blackbird, and the Jamaican tody,
one of only a few birds which goes underground to make its nest.
Butterfly enthusiasts are drawn to the mountains in search of the
giant swallowtail butterfly, with its wingspan of six inches,
that's only found there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3,000 feet up, the Blue Mountain coffee region starts.
Here the mountains are dotted with small plantations producing some
of the world's best coffee. And some of the most expensive. In the
United States, a pound sells for $35 to $40.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountains are the starting point for numerous hiking
trails leading to waterfalls and spectacular mountain vistas. Blue
Mountain Peak rises to 7,402 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jamaica has a bounty of other natural wonders to
pursue, from the three-mile Fern Gully, home to 550 species of
fern, to the Hope Botanical Gardens, at the foot of the Blue
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the island's plant species are native, earning it
the rank of fifth in the world for the most endemic plant species.
</P>
<P>
   You can take guided boat excursions up the Black River, one of
Jamaica's longest and largest rivers, or drop by the Crystal
Springs park near Port Antonio, where there are more than 15,000
varieties of plants and one of the largest orchid collections in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   You can climb the ``Niagara of the Caribbean,'' Dunn's River
Falls in Ocho Rios, which is over 600 feet high, or hike in the Rio
Grande Valley, where you'll find waterfalls, streams, and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica's a lot more than the beaches,'' said Sam McCook,
spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board. ``There is a lot of
natural beauty here.''

   WHEN TO GO:
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is a year-round destination, although the peak season,

about $150 to $200 to take tourists from Kingston to Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   Options range from small cottages to huge all-inclusive resorts.
In Montego Bay, one of the nicer places to stay is the Coyaba Beach

CONSUMERS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CONSUMERS-0909.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the current economic crisis, Russians are watching
their spending power evaporate as the ruble tumbles in value and
prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation rose to 15 percent in August, up from 0.2 percent in
July, the government announced recently. Forecasters say the August
rate could triple or quadruple by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the problem:
</P>
<P>
   INCOME: The average monthly household income in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles withered to a value of about $40 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUBLE'S FALL: Economic analysts say the ruble has fallen
farther and faster against the dollar than any other currency in
the world except for Indonesia's. In the past three weeks, the
ruble has fallen about 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   COMPARED TO THE DOLLAR:
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 13 6.2
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 14 6.3
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17 6.9 -- as government attempts controlled devaluation,
allowing ruble to slide to 9.5
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 24 7.1 -- street trading 8-9.5 rubles to the dollar
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 25 7.9 -- central bank concedes it cannot prevent ruble's
free-fall ruble rate reaches as low as 10 in street trading
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 27 12.0 -- bank and street trade takes over, official rate
of 7.9 becomes meaningless
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 28 12.9 -- black market reappears, trading at 14-15 to the
dollar
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1 13.0 -- official ruble rate set at 10.3, beyond
government-imposed guidelines
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 2 15.0
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4 17.0
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 7 20.0
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 8 22.0
</P>
<P>
   Sources: Russia Central Bank, Cox Newspapers survey of Moscow
exchange offices.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 13-25, list reflects official ruble-dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 27, list reflects unofficial trade rate in banks and
on street.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------
</P>
<P>
   PRICES RISE: In Moscow, the cost of imported and Russian-made
foods-tuffs and household products has risen 100-500 percent in the
past three weeks. Among the best buys is a Big Mac, the cost of
which has actually dipped about $1 as McDonald's price increases
have not kept pace with the slide of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   PRICES ON SOME CONSUMER ITEMS ....
</P>
<P>

rate could triple or quadruple by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the problem:
</P>
<P>
   INCOME: The average monthly household income in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles withered to a value of about $40 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUBLE'S FALL: Economic analysts say the ruble has fallen
farther and faster against the dollar than any other currency in
the world except for Indonesia's. In the past three weeks, the
ruble has fallen about 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   COMPARED TO THE DOLLAR:

<P>
   Aug. 13 6.2
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 14 6.3
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17 6.9 -- as government attempts controlled devaluation,
allowing ruble to slide to 9.5
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 24 7.1 -- street trading 8-9.5 rubles to the dollar
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 25 7.9 -- central bank concedes it cannot prevent ruble's
free-fall ruble rate reaches as low as 10 in street trading
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 27 12.0 -- bank and street trade takes over, official rate
of 7.9 becomes meaningless
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 28 12.9 -- black market reappears, trading at 14-15 to the
dollar
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1 13.0 -- official ruble rate set at 10.3, beyond
government-imposed guidelines

<P>
   PRICES RISE: In Moscow, the cost of imported and Russian-made
foods-tuffs and household products has risen 100-500 percent in the
past three weeks. Among the best buys is a Big Mac, the cost of
which has actually dipped about $1 as McDonald's price increases
have not kept pace with the slide of the ruble.

   GREECE-ARMENIA (Athens) _ The art of the past is forever being
reinterpreted in terms of the politics of the present. The most
distinctive Armenian sculptures, for example, are heavy stone
crosses called khatchkars. The Armenians, having been driven away
or massacred by the Seljuk Turks, the Turkomans, the Arabs and
others on and off since ancient times, developed khatchkars partly
as a way to leave their mark in the land. So khatchkars are
political symbols. Can they be interpreted in other ways as well?
Obviously, though politics seemed an inevitable issue in the
context of a big and excellent exhibition that was recently here.
By Michael Kimmelman.

   RECLAIMING-NAZI-ART (Undated) _ In the last six months there has

that later found its way, by various routes through dealers and
collectors, into American museums. A news analysis by Judith H.
Dobrzynski.

 &HT;    Flex your mental muscle
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The threat of going mad _ losing his mental capacity _ plagued
Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson during
almost seven years in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spent 2,455 days isolated from the world after Muslim
extremists abducted him in Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson knew instinctively what doctors swear by today: You
can combat mental decline by keeping your mind occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson goaded fellow hostages into heated debates, badgered
one into teaching him a foreign language and created his own form
of sign language and tapping noises to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying and learning new things are effective ways of keeping
your processes fresh and active,'' says Dr. Larry Eisner, medical
director of the Baumel-Eisner Neuromedical Institute in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us (after school) stop learning things on a routine
basis. If we stop learning, we stop remembering how to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do we continue that learning process?
</P>
<P>
   Reading and casual conversation are good, but ``minor'' ways of
challenging the brain, Eisner says.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to exercise your mental capabilities, take
courses, learn a new hobby or skill or participate in lectures or
``serious'' discussion groups. Doing puzzles, crosswords or playing
games that involve memory will also help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps the brain in an active mode and doesn't allow it to
deteriorate based on disuse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is the level of activity. Watching television _
even the History Channel _ is more passive than getting into a
rip-roaring debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need activities in an interactive fashion to engage your
intelligence,'' explains Dr. Rodrigo Kuljis, professor of neurology
and psychiatry at the University of Miami Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend weeks on end watching TV passively, you probably
won't do well. But people who pursue interests that are
intellectually challenging tend to preserve their intellectual
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And we can hone the sharpness of our minds well into old age.
Contrary to what was once thought, senility is not inevitable as
times passes. Twenty percent of mature adults experience no
discernible drop in their mental faculties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people in their 90s who are remarkably sharp,'' Kuljis
says. ``And that's the reason we don't accept even subtle
complaints that (mental decline) is due to aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tend to fall back into things that are
entertaining. You need things that require your participation, that
challenge you without being overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of memory, each influenced differently by
age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor of neurology at
Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
</P>
<P>
   Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Physical exercise is important to keeping the mind alert, also.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is an organ _ a functioning, living, breathing organ
_ and we want to maintain the blood flow and the connections
between nerve cells on a sound basis. We can keep them healthy and
operating at peak performance by being active and regularly
stimulated,'' Eisner adds.
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first. If needed, your
doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a complete
evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal interview
and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive skills,
including concentration and orientation.

POLL GIVES VALLONE NEW MUSCLE IN NEW YORK PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARVY LIPMAN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone has
leapfrogged into the lead in the race to be the Democratic
candidate for governor. But if he does win the party's Sept. 15
primary, it likely will be a hollow victory for Vallone _ giving
him the chance to go down in history as the man who lost one of the
biggest landslides ever seen in New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Gov. George Pataki leads not only Vallone, but
each of his four potential Democratic challengers by 40 percentage
points or more.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki looks as close to unbeatable as a politician can
two months before an election, his fellow Republican incumbents
will be facing much tougher battles in the fall. U.S. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato holds relatively small leads over the two top Democratic
challengers: Former Rep. and one-time vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro and Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn. The battle
between the leading Democrats has heated up quite a bit over the
past three weeks, with Schumer cutting Ferraro's
14-percentage-point lead in half.
</P>
<P>
   In what could well end up as the closest of all the statewide
races this fall, Attorney General Dennis Vacco faces a formidable
political foe in former Manhattan assistant district attorney Eliot
Spitzer, who has pulled far ahead in the Democratic primary
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the key findings of a poll of likely voters conducted
from Sept. 2-4 for the Albany Times Union and the Syracuse
Newspapers by Zogby International.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross led all Democratic
comers, with 24 percent of the vote to 13 percent for Vallone, 4
percent for Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes and 3
percent for former state transportation commissioner James Larocca.
Since then her political fortunes have gone the way of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   While Vallone has flooded the airwaves with advertising,
McCaughey Ross' multimillionaire husband Wilbur Ross has pulled the
financial plug on her campaign _ leaving her unable to put together
a serious television campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a race turned upside down. Vallone now is being
backed by 27 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, while the
Republican-turned-Democrat lieutenant governor has dropped to 18
percent. Hynes and Larocca continue to lag far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and McCaughey Ross are running neck-and-neck in New York
City and upstate, but Vallone has a huge lead in the New York City
suburbs. Men support him by a better than 3-to-2 margin, while
women Democrats are split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary victories depend on good organization, advertising
money and passioned voters,'' noted pollster John Zogby. ``Vallone
is aided by having the best organization and the most money. He
also has a decent issue helping him with his support of keeping
Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the primary, however, may not be the best thing that
ever happens to Vallone's political career. Pataki not only
overwhelms his challengers among all voters _ he even leads them
among likely Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Pataki simply mops up against all possible Democratic
opponents,'' Zogby said. ``Perhaps the most interesting question is
how well the minor party candidates will do, and we find that
Reform Party candidate Tom Golisano's advertising blitz is
certainly paying off as he garners almost double digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby also pointed out that if the current trends hold up, Green
Party candidate Al Lewis _ the actor who played Grandpa Munster on
TV and has been a long-time labor union activist _ may get the
50,000 votes the party needs to win an automatic spot on the ballot
next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, with millions in his campaign coffers being spent to
broadcast his face to TVs around the state, is eating into
Ferraro's once formidable lead in the race to be the Democratic
nominee for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the ground he's making up is in New York City, where
he leads both Ferraro and New York City Public Advocate Mark Green.
The Brooklyn congressman continues to trail both his opponents in
the New York City suburbs. And Ferraro dominates upstate, with 55
percent supporting her to Schumer's 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby, however, pointed out that in a Democratic primary, most
of the vote comes from New York City. ``The Senate primary looks to
be a squeaker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So does the general election, whether it's Schumer or Ferraro
facing D'Amato. The critical factor there may be Schumer's presence
on the Liberal line, an endorsement he won in the spring. Even if
Ferraro wins the Democratic primary and Schumer decides to drop out
and support her, New York election law requires that his name
remain on the ballot. In a close race, a few thousand votes
siphoned off to Schumer could allow D'Amato to win with less than
half the vote _ something he's done two of the three times he's
been elected to the Senate.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   What was a tight primary contest in the race for attorney
general has been blown wide open by Spitzer. Two months ago he and
Evan Davis, who served as chief counsel to former Gov. Mario Cuomo,
were in a virtual tie, and state Sen. Catherine Abate from
Manhattan was well within reach of the lead. Now Spitzer, with 32
percent of the vote, has more support than Davis, Abate and former
Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell combined. He's ahead among every
demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other candidates have barely made a dent in the public
mind,'' Zogby said. ``He has the money, the organization and the
focused message to even further pull away.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby added one cautionary note: ``The other candidates are only
now planning their advertising blitz.'' If it does end up being a
Spitzer-Vacco race in the fall, the incumbent attorney general
looks like he'll be in for a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, with far less name recognition than Vacco, is already
within 8 percentage points of him among likely voters.

   GREECE-ARMENIA (Athens) _ The art of the past is forever being
reinterpreted in terms of the politics of the present. The most
distinctive Armenian sculptures, for example, are heavy stone
crosses called khatchkars. The Armenians, having been driven away
or massacred by the Seljuk Turks, the Turkomans, the Arabs and
others on and off since ancient times, developed khatchkars partly
as a way to leave their mark in the land. So khatchkars are
political symbols. Can they be interpreted in other ways as well?
Obviously, though politics seemed an inevitable issue in the
context of a big and excellent exhibition that was recently here.

   RECLAIMING-NAZI-ART (Undated) _ In the last six months there has

   NY-CROWDED-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ Short of pointing a
telescope through your neighbor's window, few experiences offer
better access to the intimate details of strangers' lives than
dining in Manhattan restaurants. Who hasn't had the pleasure of
being squeezed onto a narrow banquette where the tables are too
close for comfort? Your mind may be on your companion across from
you, but you cannot avoid being distracted by the couples sitting
on either side. You overhear their conversations, you inhale their

 &HT;    Emergency contraception an ethical advance
 &HT;    By Arthur Caplan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have a very difficult time dealing with sex. Granted,
when the subject is the love life of a president, a British
princess or an underage prostitute on one of the TV tabloid shows,
we cannot shut up. But that is talk about strangers whose habits,
peccadilloes and moral failings have no immediate bearing on what
we do in our own bedrooms. When the conversation turns to our own
sex lives, to the sexuality of our spouses, children and siblings,
we have much less to say.
</P>
<P>
   Our national reticence about sex has made it impossible to
conduct reliable surveys about sexual behavior among adolescents
and to talk to one another frankly and honestly about sexually
transmitted diseases. A significant number of Americans do not
realize that fertilization does not take place at the moment of
sexual intercourse. We are so paralyzed about the topic of abortion
that all we can do is yell, picket or bomb.
</P>
<P>
   This inability to address sex and its consequences, other than
when it involves distant strangers, is why it has taken so long _
far too long _ to get a safe and effective form of emergency
contraception into the hands of our wives, sisters and daughters.
Emergency contraception, sometimes misleadingly called the
``morning-after pill'' because it works for up to three days after
sex, has long been available in many European nations. There have
been no serious side effects or complications.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, some doctors and clinics have used a
``home brew'' approach, giving high doses of birth control pills
and dealing with the consequences of rape or a failed condom or a
moment of passion where no contraception was used. But almost no
women know about emergency contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Even among women who have been raped and treated at hospitals,
many have no idea that medicine had anything to help them not
become pregnant. Most women think the only thing medicine has to
offer is RU-486, the so-called abortion pill, and for some that is
not an option. The lack of frankness about sex and about what can
be done to prevent unintended pregnancy has left American women
without the best treatment that medicine has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Food and Drug Administration has approved an
emergency contraception kit, using the same pills now used for
birth control. The kit _ marketed by Gynetics Inc., of Somerville,
N.J. _ has a pregnancy test that a woman must use first since, if
she is already pregnant, emergency contraception will do nothing to
change that. But if she is not yet pregnant, emergency
contraception will cut the chance of becoming pregnant after
unprotected sexual intercourse from 8 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency contraception is no substitute for ongoing birth
control. Condoms, ordinary birth control and other methods work
more effectively. And emergency contraception offers no protection
against sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   Still, having emergency contraception available at every
student-health or family-planning clinic, hospital emergency room
and mental health care facility as well as in every fertile woman's
medicine cabinet is a tremendous ethical advance. For centuries,
the only option that American women have had to prevent an
unintended pregnancy has been abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency contraception is just that: contraception. By delaying
a woman's ovulation, the odds of pregnancy occurring are greatly
diminished. However one views abortion, the prevention of pregnancy
is ethically better than ending a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The real tragedy is that it took so long to get a company to
make this product and for the FDA to approve it. The delay suggests
we are spending too much time worrying about the sex lives of
presidents and celebrities and not nearly enough talking about what
we can do to promote responsibility and safety in our own sex
lives.

   MOSCOW _ On one side of this sprawling city, fish-seller Natasha
Ivanova studies her merchandise as it rots in the sun at an outdoor
market in southwestern Moscow. Prices for the mullet she peddles
have risen sevenfold in the past three weeks and there are no
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic crisis has turned an already strapped nation
into a country of anxious survivalists, spending what they can to
horde food that will keep: vegetable oil, flour, sugar, coffee,
pasta and dried beans.
</P>
<P>
   Mullet is not on their shopping lists. Ivanova, 40, and her
family will be eating a lot of unsold fish in the coming days and
nights.
</P>
<P>
   In the city center, next to the Kremlin, 18-year-old Lena
Ruditskaya is bedecked in skintight designer slacks and black
platform boots, trolling for bargains in the exclusive boutiques of
the wealthy New Russians. She proudly clutches her latest catch: an
imported $130 suede jacket from a glitzy shop in the marble-trimmed
Manezh Square mall.
</P>
<P>
   An economics student and the daughter of affluent parents,
Ruditskaya's attitude resembles champagne-sipping on the Titanic:
buy now, the end of high-living is near under the waning era of
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   A city of some haves and many have-nots since the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991, Moscow has been a frenetic theater of
consumerism and fatalism in the three weeks since the country was
crippled by economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Food is disappearing from store shelves. Imports, which make up
the bulk of items in grocery stores, are not making it passed the
border as the paralyzed banking system has frozen payments. Food
prices have risen from 50 to 500 percent in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are conserving their dollars, the main form of savings
in a country whose currency has collapsed three times since
Communist rule disintegrated seven years ago. But still they must
spend to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are going, we don't know. What the politicians are
deciding, we don't know. Maybe we'll wake up from this in the
morning to find it is just a bad dream, or may be we'll be dead,''
Yulia Gladyeshava, 51, a vegetable seller said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is richer than most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Russians are simply struggling to persevere
as they have watched the plummeting ruble effectively cut their
hard-earned salaries, pensions and savings by two-thirds in the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crisis hit, most of the 147 million Russians were
caught against the tide of audacious and unfinished capitalism they
were never completely a part of. The few rich got richer, most of
the middle and lower classes did not, living on inert state
salaries and pensions that never rose with the cost of goods after
Soviet-style price controls were removed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are nearly wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in June was 861 rubles,
about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the same
income of 861 rubles withered to a value of about $40 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blow is cushioned slightly by the fact that housing and
utilities remain heavily subsidized for most Russians. Yet for
many, a second job is a must, as is a small plot of land somewhere
to grow cucumbers and tomatoes to eat or to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are groceries and clothes to buy. Each month is a
stretch to live.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow the monthly minimum wage set by law before the crisis
was 83 rubles. Now, it buys one liter of vegetable oil, two cans of
meat preserves and one loaf of bread, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit are the retirees, who lived on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Spronavov, 76, and his wife Claudia, 74, have cut meat
and chicken and cheese from their diet. It is a luxury they can no
longer afford on their combined pension of 1,280 rubles, which was
worth about $210 a month in early August and only $60 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts say the ruble has fallen farther and faster
against the dollar than any other currency in the world except for
Indonesia's. Inflation rose to 15 percent in August, up from 0.2
percent in July, the government announced recently. Forecasters say
the August rate could triple or quadruple by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see Yeltsin live in these conditions. Let's see how he
would fare,'' said Claudia, her bag filled Tuesday with the
couple's evening meal of cucumbers, potatoes and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's small middle class, no more than a few million people,
have seen their bank savings frozen or lost. Moreover, the
prospects of unemployment loom as banks, brokerage houses and
stores that catered to the new class cope with the crisis.
Employment agencies say that in the financial and related services
sector 40,000 to 100,000 jobs might be lost in Moscow over the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to sink their remaining rubles somewhere before it falls
farther in value, jewelry sales have skyrocketed, as have purchases
of big-ticket items like washing machines and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough money now to buy the things that I want,'' said
the stylish teenager, Ruditskaya, amid the luxury goods. ``I might
as well buy them now. Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   But for most Russians, the question of waiting or buying was
never an issue because disposable income was never a reality.
Yeltsin's democracy never fully delivered its promises.
</P>
<P>
   They were not part of the system that brought stock markets and
restaurants and cable television and car dealerships and
American-style shopping malls to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And for the foreseeable future, they never will be as Russia
struggles to settle its political instability and locate a
difficult road to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The fish-seller, Ivanova, was a university-educated laboratory
technician put out of work when her Soviet-era factory closed. She
turned to buying fish from a wholesaler and selling it at a
neighborhood ``rynhok,'' or farmers' market, in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago. At 2 p.m. Tuesday, she had not sold a
single mullet six hours into her workday. But her mind was not so
much on her plight, as that of her troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was such a mighty country,'' she said, looking into the
distance. ``Now, it is such an embarrassment.''

</P>
<P>
   Russians are conserving their dollars, the main form of savings
in a country whose currency has collapsed three times since
Communist rule disintegrated seven years ago. But still they must
spend to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are going, we don't know. What the politicians are
deciding, we don't know. Maybe we'll wake up from this in the
morning to find it is just a bad dream, or may be we'll be dead,''
Yulia Gladyeshava, 51, a vegetable seller said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is richer than most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Russians are simply struggling to persevere
as they have watched the plummeting ruble effectively cut their
hard-earned salaries, pensions and savings by two-thirds in the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crisis hit, most of the 147 million Russians were
caught against the tide of audacious and unfinished capitalism they
were never completely a part of. The few rich got richer, most of
the middle and lower classes did not, living on inert state
salaries and pensions that never rose with the cost of goods after
Soviet-style price controls were removed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are nearly wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in June was 861 rubles,
about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the same
income of 861 rubles withered to a value of about $40 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blow is cushioned slightly by the fact that housing and
utilities remain heavily subsidized for most Russians. Yet for
many, a second job is a must, as is a small plot of land somewhere
to grow cucumbers and tomatoes to eat or to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are groceries and clothes to buy. Each month is a
stretch to live.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow the monthly minimum wage set by law before the crisis
was 83 rubles. Now, it buys one liter of vegetable oil, two cans of
meat preserves and one loaf of bread, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit are the retirees, who lived on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Spronavov, 76, and his wife Claudia, 74, have cut meat
and chicken and cheese from their diet. It is a luxury they can no
longer afford on their combined pension of 1,280 rubles, which was
worth about $210 a month in early August and only $60 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts say the ruble has fallen farther and faster
against the dollar than any other currency in the world except for
Indonesia's. Inflation rose to 15 percent in August, up from 0.2
percent in July, the government announced recently. Forecasters say
the August rate could triple or quadruple by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see Yeltsin live in these conditions. Let's see how he
would fare,'' said Claudia, her bag filled Tuesday with the
couple's evening meal of cucumbers, potatoes and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's small middle class, no more than a few million people,
have seen their bank savings frozen or lost. Moreover, the
prospects of unemployment loom as banks, brokerage houses and
stores that catered to the new class cope with the crisis.
Employment agencies say that in the financial and related services
sector 40,000 to 100,000 jobs might be lost in Moscow over the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to sink their remaining rubles somewhere before it falls
farther in value, jewelry sales have skyrocketed, as have purchases
of big-ticket items like washing machines and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough money now to buy the things that I want,'' said
the stylish teenager, Ruditskaya, amid the luxury goods. ``I might
as well buy them now. Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   But for most Russians, the question of waiting or buying was
never an issue because disposable income was never a reality.
Yeltsin's democracy never fully delivered its promises.
</P>
<P>
   They were not part of the system that brought stock markets and
restaurants and cable television and car dealerships and
American-style shopping malls to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And for the foreseeable future, they never will be as Russia
struggles to settle its political instability and locate a
difficult road to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The fish-seller, Ivanova, was a university-educated laboratory
technician put out of work when her Soviet-era factory closed. She
turned to buying fish from a wholesaler and selling it at a
neighborhood ``rynhok,'' or farmers' market, in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago. At 2 p.m. Tuesday, she had not sold a
single mullet six hours into her workday. But her mind was not so
much on her plight, as that of her troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was such a mighty country,'' she said, looking into the
distance. ``Now, it is such an embarrassment.''

IN FRANCE, THE GOOSE IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT'S GETTING FAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUSAN HERRMANN LOOMIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUVIERS, France _ I marvel each time I watch a certain farmer
at our local market spoon rivers of thick, golden creme fraiche
into large fat glass jars for customers who tuck them into
overflowing baskets.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost predict what these guilt-free shoppers will be
having for Sunday lunch _ and it is never lo-cal. Yet they don't
seem to gain a pound. Americans, on the other hand, seem to pile on
the ounces just thinking about buying cream.
</P>
<P>
   In Normandy, my corner of France _ land of rich cheese, richer
cream and the best butter in the nation _ cream-buying market
regulars and all of my friends who eat good, hearty Norman dishes
of local products, are maintaining their shapes and enjoying their
food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a gray cloud is passing over the traditional French dietary
regimen: the French are gaining weight, if statistics are to be
believed. And if you ask anyone from the country's top
epidemiologists to starred chefs to the local grocer, they all
point to the west, the United States, the country the French love
and hate the most.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eveline Eschwege, director of epidemiological research at
the Institut National de la Sante et la Recherche Medicale in Paris
(the equivalent of the American National Institutes of Health),
says the French, indeed, are slowly but perceptibly getting
heavier. Eight percent of them now qualify as obese.
</P>
<P>
   She hastened to say that they are far behind most industrial
countries, particularly the United States, with an obesity rate of
at least 20 percent, and Germany, with a 19 percent obesity rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change is because we follow Americans in everything,'' she
said, ``including the way they eat.'' She points to an increase in
consumption of manufactured foods and sodas, and to the habit of
eating all the time, ``a l'americaine,'' as prime factors.
</P>
<P>
   But how about those classic French menus where everything seems
bathed in butter and cream? They don't put on the pounds the way
fast food does, it seems. According to Dr. Eschwege, the difference
has to do with the ingredients in traditional dishes, which are
pure and closer to their source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no chemicals, no additives, in foods that go into
traditional dishes like veal with cream sauce or roast chicken and
vegetables,'' she said. ``Also, traditional dishes like those are
eaten at table, calmly, so that satisfaction is gained and no one
is hungry two hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we see a definite, if unobtrusive, increase in
weight,'' Dr. Eschwege added, ``at least for now, the French are
still resisting. We haven't completely given up structured meal
times yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Guy-Grand, an international expert on obesity and
the head of medicine and nutrition at the Hotel-Dieu hospital in
Paris, is proud of the shape the French are in, though he
acknowledges obesity as a French public health problem. And he
views trans-Atlantic influence as a culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certain the French are eating more and more like
Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I see it myself. In 10 years of living in France and 20 years of
visiting regularly, I've watched French breakfasts gradually switch
from bakery-fresh bread, butter and coffee to packaged cereals and
commercial hot chocolate. I've seen ``sheeps'' _ potato and corn
chips _ slip into the regular French diet, and packaged pizzas, hot
dogs and frozen dinners become de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca'' (the universal French name for Coca-Cola) is now the
drink most often offered to children at meals on special occasions,
whereas even five years ago it was water, plain or with fruit
syrup; in the old days, they drank wine. ``McDo,'' or McDonald's,
has become the destination of choice for many a family night out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A friend in Paris, a chef, recently told me about two Parisian
children with full-time working parents who eat dinner every night
at their neighborhood McDo.
</P>
<P>
   Which points to a slightly more disturbing statistic, the
tripling, since the '50s, in the percentage of French children who
are overweight. According to Dr. Marie-Francoise Rolland-Cachera,
an epidemiologist at the Institut Nationale de la Sante et la
Recherche Medicale who specializes in obesity in children, it is up
from 3 percent in 1955, to above 10 percent in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Why has this happened? ``We've got many hypotheses,'' she said.
``But in the case of children it is too easy to say it's the
American style of eating. There are many other reasons, of course,
But a newly sedentary life style is one my colleagues and I have
proven.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the French are as gorgeous and chicly slim as
always. I have lost count of the number of times visiting Americans
ask me how they do it. My analysis has always attributed it to good
diet, regular exercise (no one climbs more steps than the
Metro-taking Parisians, nor carries heavier loads than the French
do coming home from the market, plenty of bread and above all,
specific and honored mealtimes: 12:30 for lunch, and 8 for dinner.
These habits continue, though they appear to be slowly, insidiously
breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   I notice it most at lunchtime in midsize to large French cities,
where instead of the traditional hush as workers stop to eat, the
sidewalks are filled with busy people, phones clapped to one ear as
they munch a sandwich. Of course, the sandwich is made with fresh,
crusty baguette, sweet-cream butter and air-cured ham or raw-milk
Camembert, but it still amounts to eating on the run.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, megalithic shopping malls _ complete with
supermarkets, shoe-repair shops, cafes, bakeries, boutiques
offering everything from perfume to shoes, and at least one
fast-food restaurant _ are gradually replacing village centers.
People drive to them, park, rent enormous shopping carts, and
browse the entire day away, eating one if not two meals there.
</P>
<P>
   My 7-year-old son's friends never fail to bring a box of cookies
or candies with them when they come to play: they expect to munch
at will all day long rather than waiting for the traditional 5 p.m.
``gouter,'' or snack time.
</P>
<P>
   These changes disturb me, as an American who has consciously
steeped myself in the country's culinary traditions, more than it
seems to disturb the French. I notice that my French friends are
eager to try the latest American food import, admire McDonald's
because they are so clean, and are happy to feed their children
breakfast cereals because they are so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I buy fresh bread daily at the local bakery, fresh
butter at the market, fresh coffee from the local roaster, and
fresh milk from the farm. And because I see farmers on a regular
basis at the market, I know exactly who raises my peas, where my
chickens, ducks, and lambs have spent their lives, and the exact
day that the shell beans will be ready to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   A hopeful sign is how easy it still is to eat well _ truly
magnificently well _ in France. Then there is the French national
stubbornness and insistence about doing things in their own
particular way. Diet is one area where a little national chauvinism
might be just what the doctor ordered. &QL;

TENEMENT HOUSE SETTING FOR DINNER PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably do not use mismatched yard-sale plates, glasses and
silverware when entertaining at home, but they are part of the
charm of arranging a dinner party in the tenement kitchen of the
Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow room, which has uneven floors, bare-bulb lighting, an
old-fashioned stove and sink and is painted a gloomy green, can be
booked for private parties. A modern convenience, air-conditioning,
has been added. A number of vintage enamel-top kitchen tables can
be pushed together to seat 30 guests; there is room in a gallery
space across the dim hallway for a cocktail reception.
</P>
<P>
   The 1863 landmark tenement building, at 97 Orchard Street
(Broome Street) and across the street from the museum's reception
area at 90 Orchard Street, has several apartments decorated to
replicate immigrant experiences from 1878 to 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Parties in the kitchen area, which has a modern, working kitchen
in the next room, include a tour of these apartments. For dinners,
the museum recommends three caterers: Festive Palate, Alison Mesrop
and a kosher company, Simply Divine.
</P>
<P>
   They specialize in menus that evoke the immigrant past. Renting
the kitchen and gallery is $750 to $850, of which $500 is a
contribution to the museum. The caterer's fee is extra. For
information: (212) 431-0233, ext. 214.
</P>
<P>
   For this fall, the museum is planning a series of benefit
dinners with various ethnic themes; they will be open to the
public. On Nov. 14, they are hoping to have an Italian dinner
prepared by Lidia Bastianich of Felidia restaurant. Information:
(212) 431-0233. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haven for Chilies
</P>
<P>
   Fresh green chilies from Hatch, N.M., which are preferred by
many cooks for Southwestern dishes, are now available at Kitchen
Market, 218 Eighth Avenue (21st Street). They are $3.95 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The market also sells other fresh chilies, including poblano and
serrano, plus dozens of kinds of dried chilies, along with chili
condiments, beans, grains and dried corn products. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tea From an Artist
</P>
<P>
   Wild Lily Tea Room, a serene oasis with a small pool of water
set into its multilevel stone floor, has opened at 511 West 22nd
Street and will serve tea and light food. Ines Sun all but
abandoned her efforts to make painting a career to devote herself
to the tea room, which is on a gallery-rich block.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 kinds of tea, plates of scones, pastries and
savories like steamed dumplings are available. The food is $6.75 to
$9.50, including a pot of tea or a glass of iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Most teas are $4. But for connoisseurs, there are teas like
first-flush Darjeeling for $8. These, the menu advises, are ``best
drunk without adding anything, only your mind.''

LOW-HEAT OVEN SLOWLY BRINGS OUT THE GOODNESS IN FRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the fourth of eight columns by Charlie Palmer, chef and
owner of Aureole in Manhattan. Judith Choate collaborated.) 
 (HLW)  
 By CHARLIE PALMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For some years now, I have been using low, dry heat
to add intense flavor to tomatoes or to make sweet root-vegetable
chips. I simply put the vegetables in a very low oven and let them
laze away as the moisture is slowly drawn out and the sugars become
caramelized and profoundly sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, to add a little distinction to some of the more common
fruits that I use in desserts, condiments, salads or garnishes, I
began experimenting with this oven-drying technique to bring out
their inherent syrupy goodness. After some fits and starts, I think
that I perfected the method.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, we have been turning out ambrosial, lightly
dried peaches, plums and nectarines as they hit the height of their
ripeness this summer. With fall approaching, we began drying
heirloom apples and pears with just as much success.
</P>
<P>
   Drying fruit (or vegetables) at home is just as easy. Any type
of oven will do: gas, electric or convection.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in no hurry _ and if you have an oven setting of less
than 200 degrees, which is usually marked ``warm'' _ use that
setting and let the fruit dry for up to 12 hours. If 200 degrees is
your lowest setting, dry the fruit for no longer than 6 hours. The
larger the pieces, the moister the fruit (or vegetable) will
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Simply place the pieces on baking sheets lined with parchment
paper, leaving at least an inch around each one, and put the sheets
in a low oven. Take a peek from time to time; the drying is done
when the edges begin to curl, the flesh begins to firm up and the
center is still very soft. Or just taste the fruit as it dries, and
remove it when it reaches the intensity you like.
</P>
<P>
   For this fall salad, the pears are only lightly dried. They
retain a great deal of their moisture, and their sugar takes on
just a hint of caramel. To add an even greater depth of flavor, I
marinate them in port and ginger before sending them off for a long
bask.
</P>
<P>
   COMPOSED SALAD OF RED OAK-LEAF LETTUCE, FENNEL, OVEN-DRIED
PEARS, TOASTED WALNUTS AND MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, including 2 hours marinating and
drying
</P>
<P>
   6 Comice pears
</P>
<P>
   1 cup port wine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fine quality, well-aged balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 medium fennel bulbs
</P>
<P>
   2 heads red oak-leaf lettuce, well washed, dried and pulled
apart
</P>
<P>
   { cup toasted walnut pieces (if available, black walnuts add an
interesting note)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Maytag Blue Cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel pears, cut them in half lengthwise, and carefully remove
core and stem.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine port, brown sugar and ginger in a shallow baking
dish. Add pear halves, cut-side down, and spoon port mixture over
them. Cover with plastic film and marinate for 1 hour, turning from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place marinated pears on a
parchment paper-lined baking sheet in the oven, and dry for about 1
hour or until pears are just beginning to firm but remain moist in
the center.
</P>
<P>
   4. Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar. Season to taste
with salt and cracked black pepper. Wash and trim the fennel bulbs.
Cut bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut fennel lengthwise into very
thin slices.
</P>
<P>
   5. Beginning at the wide end, cut each half of pear lengthwise,
down to but not through the stem end.
</P>
<P>
   6. Toss lettuce and fennel together. Add a small amount of
dressing, and toss to combine. Place equal portions of the dressed
mixture on each of six luncheon plates. Fan two pear halves across
the greens, overlapping the stem ends. Sprinkle a few walnut pieces
around the edges of the plates. Crumble an equal portion of the
cheese over each plate. Drizzle a bit of the remaining dressing
over the top, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

NEWSLETTER POINTS THE WAY TO RARE BUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you're a wine fanatic whose day is incomplete if it doesn't
include a bottle of some rare California cabernet. Unfortunately,
you have lots of incomplete days, because most shops don't carry
them and those that do are always sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Help is at hand. First Sip, a new monthly wine newsletter, not
only identifies the wines, as do all the other newsletters, but
goes the extra mile and lists where to find them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, should you be a devotee of Etude Pinot Noir, a Napa
Valley wine made by the ultimate cult winemaker, Tony Soter, the
July issue of First Sip lists nine shops where the wine can be
found: two each in California, Missouri and Arizona, and one each
in Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey. And a cabernet sauvignon
from the Grace Family Vineyards, also in the Napa Valley and one of
the most difficult American wines to obtain, can be found in two
shops, both in California, First Sip writes.
</P>
<P>
   A tip: these rare wines often turn up where you would least
expect to find them _ in out-of-the-way shops often overlooked by
the big spenders. These shops acquire the wines when they can, but
by no means consistently. This is where First Sips steps in: it
does the searching for you.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers will sell only one bottle, and others offer only
a vertical selection, which means the buyer must take three
bottles, each from a successive vintage. But most retailers expect
the seekers of these rare wines to fill out their orders with
quantities of other, less exclusive but almost as expensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   First Sip finds rare wines by faxing hundreds of wine shops
nationwide, said Steven Dworman, its publisher, who also publishes
Infomercial Marketing Report, another newsletter. Retailers ``have
made a very specific point that they are not looking for `cherry
pickers,''' he said. ``Appearing in First Sip is worthwhile to them
only if they sell more than just the prized wines.''
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter also lists hard-to-find wines that can be
purchased from wineries. The May issue noted that Dunn Vineyards in
Napa had small quantities of its 1986 and 1987 Howell Mountain
cabernets at $150 and $120 a bottle, respectively. Current vintages
are sold only to clients on a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   Often, First Sip's reports on the small wineries include useful
tips. An item on the Cain Vineyard and Winery's 1995 vintage
(available this January) noted that with a purchase of a case of
Cain Five, the Napa winery's Bordeaux-style blend, regular
customers can join Club Cain, get 15 percent off wine purchases and
an invitation to a party at the winery.
</P>
<P>
   For the present, much of this information _ and that on many
smaller California wineries _ mostly benefits Californians. Many
states, including New York, in thrall to powerful liquor lobbies,
prohibit the direct interstate shipment from producer to consumer
of wines and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   But East Coast wine enthusiasts who regularly visit California
wine country carry these wines home with them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are First Sip's 10 most-difficult-to-find United States
wines (all of them from California), in order of rarity: 1)
Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley; 2) Grace Family
Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley; 3) Sine Qua Non the
Bride, Arroyo Grande Valley; 4) Marcassin Winery Chardonnay,
Carneros, Hudson Vineyards E Block; 5) Colgin Cellars Cabernet
Sauvignon, Napa Valley, Herb Lamb Vineyard; 6) Abreu Cabernet
Sauvignon, Napa Valley, Madrona Vineyard; 7) Dalla Valle Maya, Napa
Valley Proprietary Red Wine; 8) Dehlinger Winery Pinot Noir,
Sonoma, Russian River Valley Reserve; 9) Plumpjack Winery Cabernet
Sauvignon, Napa Valley, Mount Eden Vineyard, and 10) Bryant Family
Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly household names. Nor do these listings necessarily
represent the very best in California wines. They represent
extremely good wines that are in very short supply. Grace Family
Vineyards makes 300 cases of some of its wines; Screaming Eagle
made 175 cases of its 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley. The
quirky Sine Qua Non winery, in South Central California, turned out
80 six-packs of a 1995 Rhone blend called Red Handed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither prices nor vintages are supplied for the
most-difficult-to-find list. First Sip assumes that the collectors
of these wines are so dedicated to owning them that neither price
nor vintage matters. Given the care with which the grapes are
selected and the wines made, the product is almost always
excellent. And if it isn't, well, having the bottle is more
important than drinking the wine.
</P>
<P>
   While the early issues of First Sip seemed to concentrate on the
Napa Valley, there have been articles on Oregon and Washington
State, where wineries like Broadley Vineyards (Oregon) and L'Ecole
No. 41 (Washington) might one day qualify for the difficult-to-find
list. No Napa-or-nothing snob, Dworman plans to cover the American
wine scene in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Is his publication, which began in March, a worthy newcomer? For
serious collectors, definitely. For the rest of us, it's great fun
and even informative in an unreal way, like a magazine devoted to
large yachts. Everyone likes to know how the better half lives.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the newsletter is so enthusiastic it becomes wearing
after a while, but then it's new and trying to be friendly to
everyone. With time, one hopes it will adopt a more measured pace.
</P>
<P>
   Dworman says he will keep his subscription list to 5,000. To
keep out the riffraff, I guess. When the riffraff discover that the
price is $189 a year, they will probably stay away on their own.
(The first year, Dworman is offering a charter subscription for
$99.) First Sip's address is 11533 Thurston Circle, Los Angeles
90049; (800) 523-2727 or (310) 472-5253.

<P>
   Grilling is such a familiar cooking technique for Americans that
its particular effect on foods is often overlooked. Take, for
instance, what grilling does to a steak. It browns and sears it in
neat straight lines, so that you get crisp bites of a deep,
caramelized flavor in between more tender parts untouched by the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think of grilling, though, they think of
barbecue, charcoal and footlong forks. But this time of year, as
backyard cooks start moving back to the kitchen, they have an
indoor alternative _ a grill pan.
</P>
<P>
   It looks much like a saute pan but has ridges rising from the
base. And it can be used with pretty much any food you would grill
outdoors: salmon steaks, vegetables, sausages, even fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But let's make something clear: a grill pan is not a substitute
for an outdoor grill. The similarities pretty much stop at the
grill marks. Food cooks with more moisture in a grill pan because
steam collects between the ridges and the base of the pan. It also
does not get any of the smoky flavor from natural charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   (That isn't to say there is no smoke. On the contrary, if you
have a typical apartment kitchen with no exhaust hood and little
air circulation, a grill pan may not work for you at all.)
</P>
<P>
   In testing five grill pans, I found that almost every one had a
trade-off. A pan either performed just adequately and was easy to
clean up, or it performed well, made a lot of smoke and was
difficult to clean.
</P>
<P>
   I began with All-Clad's 11-inch-square nonstick pan, which costs
$59.99 at the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st Street (York Avenue)
in New York City; (212) 987-0885. It is as light as a feather and
very easy to clean, and the square shape makes four steaks an easy
fit.
</P>
<P>
   When I grilled half-inch-thick slices of summer squash brushed
with olive oil, they cooked through at the same rate as they
browned. But with a steak, the rounded ridges in the pan simply
were not deep enough. The browned parts blended together, so the
meat looked as if I had broiled it.
</P>
<P>
   Calphalon makes an almost identical pan, with an anodized
aluminum surface like All-Clad's, but not nonstick. In performance,
it runs laps around the All-Clad. It is exceptionally light, and
its ridges are distinct.
</P>
<P>
   They imprinted the squash and steaks with definite lines and
cooked the food evenly at all points. Its only drawback is that
cleanup is labor-intensive: the manufacturer advises scrubbing it
with an abrasive cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   This pan is also available in a 12-inch round shape. The 11-inch
square is $49.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street (Wooster
Street); (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Then I tried the heavier, more traditional iron grill pans. Le
Creuset's has the brand's traditional shiny enamel coating on the
outside, but a matte coating inside. The pan heated evenly but,
like the All-Clad's, its ridges were too shallow, so the steaks
might as well have been sauteed. It is available in 10- and 12-inch
sizes; the 12-inch is $65.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th
Street); (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   I went out on a limb and tried a more obscure brand, the
Villaware Sear-Top Grill Pan, which has a slanted cooking surface
so that grease collects at one side. It also has a ridged iron lid
that is heated on a separate burner and placed on top of whatever
you are cooking, to cook the food on both sides at once. I had high
hopes, thinking that perhaps I had uncovered a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But I was underwhelmed. This pan, which weighs in at 14 pounds
8.2 ounces, is so heavy I had to use both hands to move it around.
But the squash, I am afraid, suffered more than I.
</P>
<P>
   It completely flattened under the weight of the lid. The steak,
on the other hand, cooked beautifully, with dark, caramelized
lines. But because the fat all drips to one side, it began to burn,
throwing off billowing clouds of smoke. (My apartment is still
recovering.)
</P>
<P>
   Though I heated the lid over a high flame for a full five
minutes before cooking, once I placed it on the steak it simply did
not have the heat to brown it, so I had to flip the steak anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If you like cooking to be a workout, you can call Villaware,
(800) 822-1335, for a store location or to order direct. A
rectangular pan, 12} by 9 inches, is $40; an 11-inch square is $40,
and an 11-inch round pan is $35.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I am still partial to basic cast-iron grill pans.
Many manufacturers make them. I tried one by Lodge that got raging
hot, took hold of the steak and practically branded it with deep
narrow ridges. It smokes like crazy and is ridiculously heavy _
though not nearly as heavy as the Villaware _ but it did the job,
which, frankly, felt more like grilling than what happened with the
lighter, more refined pans.
</P>
<P>
   Cast iron, of course, is not supposed to be washed in soapy
water but heated and rubbed with oil to clean and season it. After
cooking a steak with lots of sticky, juicy bits clinging to the
pan, that's not very much fun.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as you can remember how succulently caramelized the
steak was, then perhaps it is worth the elbow grease. The best
part, though, is the price, a fraction of the others: an 11-inch
Lodge cast-iron grill pan is $17.95 at Broadway Panhandler.

CALIFORNIA'S GRAND JURY SYSTEM FACES FLURRY OF CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They convene as virtual strangers, they meet in
secret, and they can investigate more than 7,000 public agencies in
California. Their mission: to expose local government waste,
mismanagement and wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Civil grand juries issue what inevitably are trumpeted as
``blistering,'' ``scathing'' critiques on the ills of bureaucracy _
be they redundant library branches, overtime abuse or cockroaches
in the jails.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, grand juries in the nine-county San Francisco
Bay area alone have issued dozens of detailed reports at a combined
taxpayer cost of more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one hitch: At best, two-thirds of grand jury
recommendations are rejected or simply ignored. That reality is
fueling a heated debate about how to rescue civil grand juries, or
whether they're worth saving at all.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders argue for strengthening the citizen panels by giving
them larger budgets, more resources, and forcing local officials to
either enact the recommendations or prove why they should not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens watching over the government _ that's something we
need more of, not less,'' said Jim Shultz, executive director of
the San Francisco-based Democracy Center.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, often public officials smarting from a grand jury
report, prefer stripping grand juries of power they say encourages
amateur snoops to run amok. The most prominent convert to their
ranks, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, came under fire from San
Francisco's civil grand jury and responded by ridiculing them as
accountable to no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand juries have outlived themselves'' and ``ought to be
abolished,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past legislative session, the two sides skirmished over a
host of proposals to reform the system.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over grand juries has failed so far to interest the
public. Notes former San Francisco grand juror Hilda Bernstein:
``Most people simply don't know what the heck it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of civil grand juries in school textbooks
and only passing references to them in law schools, notes the
California Grand Jurors Association. Superior Court judges _ those
responsible for civil grand juries _ sometimes don't understand how
they work.
</P>
<P>
   In their zenith a century ago, grand juries held enormous power.
But now the Legislature is rethinking the concept of civil grand
juries amid these concerns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand jurors are largely amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment we ask of grand jurors is absolutely
incredible. They are exposed to huge bureaucracies and expected to
understand the complexities of a school system or sheriff's
department or auditor's department,'' said Scott Thorpe,
California's supervising deputy attorney general who advises grand
juries. ``What I hear from grand juries is they're overwhelmed and
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand juries have limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   Civil grand juries could hire consultants for needed expertise,
but they rarely have the money to do so. Individual counties would
have to authorize the expense and they usually won't. Sometimes
even the basics are impossible to come by: The headquarters of the
Del Norte County Grand Jury consists of a file cabinet in a
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most grand jury budgets are lower than the annual salary of
the lowest paid staffer in any bureaucracy,'' said Dan Taranto,
president of the California Grand Jurors Association. ``Imagine
ordinary citizens thrown together with no handbook, no phone, no
typewriter, and the county says `Now go do your job.'''
</P>
<P>
   But San Mateo County Supervisor Mike Nevin, a leader of efforts
to curb grand jury power, said the grand juries ``already spending
too much because what they do is so unfocused.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand jury reports may contain inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   One report about overtime abuses among San Francisco's public
employees found than an airport worker had racked up 4,700 hours of
annual overtime worth $172,880.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was it was wrong: the figure referred to the
combined overtime of several airport employees. A debate ensued
about who made the error _ the grand jury itself or the airport,
which supplied the data.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand juries operate in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the panels, which are not subject to the Brown Act
requiring open meetings, often reach wrong conclusions because they
act in secrecy and rarely confirm their findings with affected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They guard their information like gold,'' said Nick Warner,
legislative advocate for the California State Association of
Counties. ``Human nature dictates if you're being investigated and
haven't had a chance to tell your side of the story, and you get a
report that criticizes you or your department, your attitude is
gonna be, `Thanks so much _ now get outta here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The counties association tried to get a state law requiring
grand juries to share details of their investigations with
government agencies before going public, but that provision spurred
protest by former jurors and was weakened.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand juries lack time for thorough work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system sets grand jurors up for their one moment in the
sun, their lifetime opportunity for power and glory,'' Nevin said.
``There isn't always time to develop what would be a worthwhile
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevin argues for changing the panel's name from ``grand jury''
to ``citizen review committee'' _ a title he said better conveys
its role without connoting grandiose authority.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the grand jury system insist problems are rare.
Moreover, because officials have the power to stonewall
investigations, grand juries need all the authority they can get,
Shultz said. And while their reports often aren't the first to
spotlight problems, ``a grand jury report puts a dose of
credibility on the findings, because they have a formal role.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another problem cited with the grand jury system is that public
officials can ignore grand jury reports that merit action.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, forewoman of San Francisco's 1995 Grand Jury, recalls
doing a report that was ``superb, took a lot of time and effort,
and was essentially ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   In some counties, grand juries have persuaded newspapers to
distribute the full text of their reports to subscribers. Even so,
grand juries remain enigmas _ and local officials retain plenty of
wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' said Deputy Attorney General Thorpe.
``If the public doesn't care enough to rally behind the grand jury
report and hold people accountable, maybe there's a reason. ...
Maybe that particular report is not that important or that
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Few officials _ save Mayor Brown _ call for the outright
abolition of the grand juries, and by last week even Brown would
only say, ``I don't want to talk about the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner argues in a master's thesis that grand juries will have
to be redefined ``as more taxpayer dollars are wasted on unusable
civil grand jury reports.''
</P>
<P>
   But the California Grand Jurors Association insists civil grand
juries save enough by spotlighting government waste to pay for
themselves many times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that about 30 percent of grand jury reports are
actually implemented ... and in baseball, that's batting pretty
good,'' Taranto said.

CRISPY LAMB SHANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm often confused by the common wisdom of cooking. Why, for
example, do so many recipes have you brown lamb shanks and other
tough meats, when the braising for two or more hours after that to
make them tender breaks down the lovely, crisp crust created by the
browning? The simple truth is that browning creates complex
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But so does long, slow cooking. And a downside to browning meats
at the beginning of cooking is that it creates hot, flying drops of
fat, often accompanied by minor burns and a huge mess.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a solution: cook lamb shanks (or short ribs, or any other
really tough cut of meat on the bone) for a long time in liquid,
until they are supremely tender. Then grill or broil the shanks,
which will give them their crust. The braising liquid serves as a
succulent sauce.
</P>
<P>
   All this takes, really, is time _ the work is minimal. I find
that a combination of port and garlic provides plenty of flavor,
but if you want to add a few aromatic vegetables to the broth, like
carrots, onions and celery, they'll certainly make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can change the character of the dish entirely by braising
the meat in ginger and soy sauce, as in the variation below.
</P>
<P>
   It pays to arrange your schedule to make this slow-cooked dish
in a leisurely fashion. I prefer to braise the shanks the night
before serving them, while I'm cooking something else or even while
I'm out of the kitchen entirely.
</P>
<P>
   They need occasional turning (I suggest every 30 minutes, but 15
minutes more or less between turnings won't matter), but no more
attention than that.
</P>
<P>
   When the shanks are done, refrigerate the meat and sauce
separately; well wrapped, they'll keep perfectly for two or three
days. This allows you to skim the fat from the sauce before
reheating.
</P>
<P>
   The shanks will reheat in the time it takes to brown them. The
sauce needs nothing but salt, pepper and a touch of vinegar or
lemon juice to balance its sweetness. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED AND GRILLED LAMB SHANKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: At least 2{ hours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 lamb shanks, each about 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   1 cup port or red wine
</P>
<P>
   8 cloves garlic (don't bother to peel them)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon red wine vinegar or lemon juice, or to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine lamb shanks, port or other wine and garlic in a
skillet just large enough to hold shanks. Turn heat to high and
bring to a boil; cover, and adjust heat so that the mixture simmers
gently. Cook, turning about every 30 minutes, until shanks are
tender and a lovely mahogany color: 2 hours or, more likely,
longer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove shanks and strain the sauce. If time allows,
refrigerate both separately. Skim fat from top of sauce. Heat a
charcoal or gas grill or the broiler; the rack should be 4 to 6
inches from the heat source, and the fire hot.
</P>
<P>
   3. Grill or broil shanks until nicely browned all over,
sprinkling them with salt and pepper, and turning as necessary;
total cooking time will be about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the
sauce gently; season it with salt and pepper, then add vinegar or
lemon juice. Taste, and add more seasoning if needed. Serve shanks
with sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For anise-flavor lamb shanks (or short ribs), braise
the meat in a mixture of \ cup soy sauce, 1 cup water, 5 thin
slices of ginger, 5 whole star anises, 4 cloves garlic and 1
tablespoon sugar. Proceed as above, finishing the sauce with rice
vinegar or white-wine vinegar.

   Madame Curry packaged Indian mixes are what foods like
Rice-A-Roni should be. The recipes are authentic, the instructions
are easy to follow and the quality of the ingredients is
exceptional _ the fragrance of the spices practically leaps through
the plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Olena Rajan Murphy, the owner of Miami-based Madame Curry, put
together eight packages, each containing a recipe and any
out-of-the-way ingredients. The orange lentil curry soup mix, for
instance, contains lentils, curry and an aromatic mixture of panch
phoron masala seeds, whole dried chili pepper pods and turmeric.
All you add is chicken stock, vegetable oil, an onion and fresh
cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy, a cooking teacher, got the idea when taking students
on tours of ethnic markets. ``The question was always, `Why do I
need to buy a whole jar of this when all I need is a teaspoon or an
ounce?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something my father used to say about Indian cooking was you
can cook a meal if you only had one fire,'' she said. ``So what
I've done is that even if you have a minimum amount of space in
your kitchen, you can cook an interesting array of dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp curry would make an impressive dinner party dish. It
takes just 20 minutes to prepare, is flecked with green herbs and
fresh pink shrimp and has a brightly flavored broth. A Basmati rice
and lentil pullao is as intense as it is toothsome, and the Punjabi
chana, or curried chickpea salad, is spicy, fresh-tasting and
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Other packages are a zesty salmon curry, fragrant Basmati rice,
South Indian chicken curry and South Indian pot roast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Madame Curry recipe packages cost $4.95 to $6.95 and are sold
via mail order: (800) 656-5303 or www.madamecurry.com.

PARIS GETS A NEW SUBWAY LINE FOR A NEW CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
 
NEW YORK TIMES CORRESPONDENTS EXPLORE FALL AND WINTER SEASONS IN
EUROPE (For release on Sunday, Sept. 13)  
(jw)  By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    PARIS _ Almost exactly 100 years after Paris began construction
of its famous Metro, the network's first high-speed and fully
automated line will open in Oct. 15 after six years of
construction.
 &HT;    The new underground line, No. 14, is called Meteor, and will run
from the Rue de Tolbiac, near the Francois Mitterrand Library on
the Left Bank, to the Madeleine stop, near the church on the Right
Bank, with connections to parallel Metro and RER rapid-transit
lines at the Gare de Lyon and Chatelet.
 &HT;    The Meteor line, which has cost $1 billion to build, gets its
name for speed, though in the subway everything is relative. The
rubber-wheeled trains will move as fast as 50 mph over the tracks,
a third faster than conventional subway trains.
 &HT;    There will be no drivers or conductors; a central control room
will run the trains like robots. The air-cushioned, six-car trains
will take 11 minutes, with stops, to travel the five-mile route,
and are expected to carry 60 million passengers in the first year,
about the same as the first Metro line did the year after it opened
in 1900.
 &HT;    The original Metro lines had their own distinctive look, many
featuring Art Nouveau stations and stairways designed by Hector
Guimard. The new Meteor stations have a 21st-century aspect like
the monorails at Frankfurt or Newark airports.
 &HT;    Bernard Kohn, whose firm Bernard Kohn &AMP; Associes designed six of
the first eight Meteor stations and drafted the artistic concept
for the line, said: ``Everybody in a big city like this should have
the same right to transport in dignity. So we have beautiful
indirect, nonaggressive lighting and have tried to create an open,
welcoming environment in the stations. Before you get to the
station platforms, you come into a mezzanine that overlooks the
tracks, so you can see where you're going, or even change your mind
and go back up if you want.''
 &HT;    The tracks and trains are inside a glass-and-steel tube, with
see-through doors that slide open simultaneously with those of the
train after the cars come to a stop.
 &HT;    The line, expressly intended to provide relief to the
overcrowded central RER network that it parallels, has come under
criticism for ending at the Madeleine instead of the nearby Gare
St.-Lazare, one of the busiest commuter stations in Paris.
 &HT;    Tunneling will extend the line to St.-Lazare by 2002 or 2003,
according to the Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens, the Paris
transit authority. Ultimately, the authority plans an extension to
Port de Gennevilliers, in the northwestern suburbs, to Maison
Blanche in the south of Paris, covering 12 miles.

 UNDERGROUND SHOW OF AN ANCIENT HERITAGE  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ For the best part of the 1990s, Barcelona has
been busily making itself look new. Coinciding with the 1992 Summer
Olympics, it spruced up the ornate buildings of the late
19th-century Modernista movement made famous by Antonio Gaudi and
invited top-flight contemporary architects like Richard Meier,
Norman Foster, Arata Isozaki and Santiago Calatrava to add daring
new shapes to the city's profile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the city has decided to look after its ancient past.
Seemingly eager to boast just how old it is, Barcelona has
renovated the History of the City Museum in the heart of the
legendary Gothic Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself is not that old. Founded in 1943, it occupies
the 15th-century Casa Padellas, which in 1931 was moved, literally
stone by stone, to its present site to make room for a road. What
is old, however, is the remains of Roman Barcelona, or Barcino, as
it was known, that lie beneath the museum. Unsurprisingly, these
are the museum's principal attractions. And these were the main
focus of the two-year renovation that concluded in late June, when
the ruins were reopened to the public. The museum says it is the
only such institution in Europe with a large archeological site in
its very basement.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new discoveries during the renovation, the
54,000-square-foot site now reaches farther under the cathedral,
the nearby Plaza del Rey and several adjacent buildings. Scholars
have identified the area as having been commercial and industrial,
with different buildings used for dyeing clothes, cleaning and
packing fish and making wine. At the same time, they have found
traces of a Visigoth church dating back to the early seventh
century. The visitors' path now winds some 650 yards underground
through the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   To make the museum _ and the city's history _ more accessible,
other improvements were added. A reception area, with signs in
English, makes it easier for visitors to find their way around the
museum. And in a nod to the future, a movie, ``Barcelona: A Virtual
History,'' offers a 28-minute overview of 2,000 years (head sets
provide commentary in English).
</P>
<P>
   The museum's exhibitions concentrate on Barcelona's first
millennium, starting with the first pre-Roman Iberian settlement at
nearby Montjuich and the construction of Barcino in an area now
covered by the Gothic Quarter, but also including the rise of the
Visigothic monarchy and the city's Christianization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the city's growth and wealth are illustrated by a
reconstituted interior of a typical Roman home in miniature as well
as by original ceramic pottery, statues, fibulas, jewelry and
remnants of frescoes, it is under ground that the magic of the past
comes alive. Indeed, to emerge from the remains of Barcino into
15th-century Barcelona only underlines the continuity of history.
Today the city is impatient to embrace the 21st century, but it has
not forgotten where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Hours: Open Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. June 29
to Sept. 30; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. the rest of the
year. Open all year on Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Closed Monday.
Price: Tuesday through Friday 700 pesetas; Saturday and Sunday, 750
pesetas. Reduced price of 500 pesetas for students and visitors
over 60; free for children under 12.

   FRANKFURT _ Some cities are famous for their cultural life,
others for history or night life. Frankfurt, perhaps unjustly, is
famous primarily for its airport.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this city's central location in Europe and its role
as Germany's financial center, the airport is one Europe's biggest
and busiest airport hubs. It is huge, it is efficient and you can
make a round trip to almost any other city in Europe within one
day, and usually choose among multiple flights. No airport in
Europe except London's Heathrow has so many direct daily
connections to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Frankfurt airport is expanding its connections.
Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway, is finishing an airport
station for high-speed intercity trains heading for scores of other
European cities.
</P>
<P>
   The new station, which should be completed by the end of this
year, will let air travelers hop directly onto trains rather than
haul their baggage onto a subway to the main train station
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The railway is also developing an advanced luggage-handling
system that will eventually let people boarding a train in certain
cities, like Munich or Hanover, check their bags straight through
to New York or Paris. In 2002, Deutsche Bahn expects to complete a
new high-speed track between Frankfurt and Cologne. For most
travelers, that will make it far cheaper and almost as fast to
travel by train as by plane from Frankfurt to cities with smaller
airports, like Dusseldorf, Cologne or Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   While most travelers come to Frankfurt either for business or
for connections to other European cities, the Frankfurt Ballet has
long been one of this city's genuinely world-class cultural
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of William Forsythe, the ballet's New
York-born artistic director who has worked in Frankfurt since 1984,
the ballet has become internationally recognized for its
avant-garde productions.
</P>
<P>
   Now Forsythe is expanding his reach. Though he remains artistic
director of the Frankfurt Ballet, he was recently named to head
this city's Teater am Turm, or TAT. Situated in a former
trolley-car station, the TAT has a reputation for experimental
productions under directors like Werner Fassbinder and Claus
Peymann.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe's goal is to revitalize the theater by blending dance,
drama and musical performances under one roof, and to strengthen
its financing. If he and his associates live up to their track
records, the results will almost certainly be original.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt's row of museums along the Main River has got a fresh
boost with the ambitious renovation of the Stadel Art Institute.
After a two-year makeover, the museum recently reopened the wing
that houses its fine collection of old masters. The museum has also
added a new bookshop and lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   A second phase of the renovation, of the rest of the museum,
will be completed in the summer of 1999.
</P>

   GENEVA _ The Grand Theatre, a beloved and prestigious Geneva
institution, is about to reopen after a thorough overhaul that kept
it closed for a year. The $13 million renovation project equipped
the old house with state-of-the-art stage machinery and made other
improvements, including the replacement of the nearly 1,500 seats
with ones with red velvet cushions.
</P>
<P>
   The florid ceiling fresco in the foyer, an allegory of ``Joyous
Music'' and ``Tragic Music,'' remains.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate facade of the Grand Theatre, on the Place Neuve,
looking out on the airy Promenade des Bastions, seems a smaller
version of the Paris Opera. To the present director general of the
Geneva house, Renee Auphan, a native of Marseilles, the setting is
familiar: She spent 13 years as a soloist at the Paris Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva's imposing neo-Baroque shrine of the lyrical drama, rich
outside with columns, pediments and statuary, and inside with
marble and crystal chandeliers, was inaugurated 119 years ago with
Rossini's ``Guillaume Tell,'' celebrating the Swiss national hero,
William Tell. Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saens, Massenet and Stravinsky
have conducted their own works here.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Theatre is sometimes included in lists of the world's
10 best opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that each of the three operas to be offered this
fall in the rejuvenated house will be sung in one of the three
principal languages of the Swiss Confederation _ German, Italian
and French.
</P>
<P>
   A new production of Richard Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier'' will be
presented Sept. 21 and reprised Sept. 24, 27 and 29, and Oct. 2 and
5. Phillippe Auguin will conduct; the soprano Tina Kiberg, the
mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager and Markus Hollop are the
principals.
</P>
<P>
   Rossini's ``Semiramide'' will be performed Oct. 30 and Nov. 2,
5, 8, 10 and 13, with Gianluigi Gelmetti conducting and soprano
Nelly Miricioiu in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   A new production of Massenet's ``Cendrillon'' will be presented
Dec. 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21. Valentin Raymond will conduct,
and soprano Svetla Vassileva appear as Cinderella. Tickets go on
sale Monday for $16 to $103 at the box office, 11 Boulevard du
Theatre, phone (41-22) 418-3130, fax (41-22) 418-3001.
</P>
<P>
   On a contemporary note, the striking new auditorium of the
restructured Batiment des Forces Motrices (now commonly called the
BFM), will open its 1998-99 season on Oct. 6 with ``Soiree de
Ballet Dance en Pieces,'' modern choreography performed by the
Ballet of the Grand Theatre (daily, except Tuesdays, until Oct.
18).
</P>
<P>
   The BFM sits on an island in the Rhone, near the western edge of
Geneva, like a boat anchored in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The low-slung brick-and-concrete building, with its huge steel
rafters, is an abandoned industrial plant that has been converted
into a multipurpose complex, including a 985-seat theater. It still
has a technical air; two inactive turbines grace the spacious
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the new home for the ballet, the building will be
used for avant-garde opera and plays.
</P>

   MOSCOW _ Even Muscovites, who by now have grown used to the
giant gold onion dome on their horizon, still stop sometimes to
marvel at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, the enormous church
that has been built anew on the banks of the Moscow River near the
Pushkin Museum for the Fine Arts. More than anything else in this
fast-changing city, the vast cathedral _ whether or not you like
its heavyset grandeur _ has come to symbolize Russia's attempt to
undo the physical damage caused by the hand of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral was planned in 1812 in commemoration of Russia's
victory over Napoleon, and construction began in earnest in 1830.
It was finally consecrated in 1883. In 1931, Stalin, in one of his
most spectacular acts of vengeance against the Russian Orthodox
Church, ordered the cathedral's demolition, which began with a
systematic looting of its sumptuous interior.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, 1931, the 30-story-high cathedral, topped by a
gigantic copper-covered cupola, was reduced to rubble by a series
of powerful explosions. Plans to build a gargantuan skyscraper in
its place were eventually dropped, and instead, the city used the
site for an Olympic-size swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   A grass-roots plan among Orthodox believers to build a new
cathedral dates back to the 1980s, but the project took off a
decade later with an aggressive fund-raising campaign conducted by
Moscow's politically ambitious Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The cornerstone
for the new cathedral was laid in January 1995. Three years later,
with a remarkable speed that testifies to a potent mix of political
will and religious faith, the cathedral was virtually finished,
except for the reconstruction of the elaborate interior of the
upper church.
</P>
<P>
   The lower church, with an entrance on Gogol Boulevard, on
Moscow's inner circular road southwest of the Kremlin, has been
open for services almost since the beginning of construction. It is
open every day from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and functions as a regular
parish with vigil services on Saturdays at 5 p.m., and services on
Sundays at 10 a.m. On weekday holidays, vigils are at 6 p.m. on the
eve of the feast day, with liturgy held the following morning at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may have to wait until the end of next year for a
glimpse of the upper church, where workers are still reassembling
and duplicating icons and returning marbled walls and a gilded
iconostasis to their former glory. But a museum is open off the
corridor leading to the simpler lower church, which tells the story
of the church, its tragedy and triumph, in photographs and original
objects salvaged from the rubble. Also on display are works by the
artists involved in the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, shut briefly this summer, reopened this month. Hours
are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is free. English-speaking
guides can be hired.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an observation deck around the belfry, open to
tourists on something of a catch-as-catch-can basis. Requests can
be made at the offices in the lower church, and when a significant
number of visitors has gathered, they are taken up to the deck,
where they can be photographed against the backdrop of the Kremlin.
There is a nominal fee.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds around the cathedral are also open, where visitors
can gaze, at close quarters, upon the sheer scale and scope of the
building, its four belfries and cupola, topped by a giant cross.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York is a perverse place. For years, restaurant
owners have invested huge sums to get earsplitting acoustics,
eye-popping interior design and the kind of bustling movement
normally found on a trading floor. Now they are installing tiny
private rooms that let diners tune it all out.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Central Terminal may seem like the last place anyone would
go in search of peace and solitude, but at Michael Jordan's Steak
House, the impossible becomes possible. Off the main dining room, a
maximum of six diners may book a table _ there's only one _ in a
secluded space known as Michael's Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 8 by 12 feet, it's more like a meditation chamber, and
it's an open question whether Jordan could even fit into the space.
The walls, in soothing polished mahogany, block out the sights and
sounds of the restaurant and the surrounding terminal. When the
folding doors are closed, diners can achieve the kind of privacy
normally found in an isolation tank.
</P>
<P>
   At Picholine, not exactly a mosh pit to begin with, a maximum of
eight diners can put a buffer between themselves and the rest of
the crowd by entering a little private room, with a single table,
that looks onto the restaurant's cheese cave. It's a cozy space,
surrounded by floor-to-ceiling wine racks, and visible to the
outside world through a large window that makes the party within
look like a museum exhibit, a late-20th-century version of those
Indian tribes feasting on corn at the American Museum of Natural
History.
</P>
<P>
   The new-style private room fulfills three functions. Business
customers use it to hold confidential meetings, confident that they
will not be overheard. Celebrities can put a wall between them and
any prying eyes. (At Picholine they can sneak in and out by a back
exit.) And diners looking for a romantic evening can shut out the
rest of the world, including, in some cases, the waiter. At the
Park restaurant in the Lombardy Hotel, staff members are under
strict orders not to enter the small private Garden Room until
summoned. Wink, wink.
</P>
<P>
   For all their sense of exclusivity, private rooms are not any
more difficult to reserve than a regular table. A week's notice at
most is usually enough to secure the space.
</P>
<P>
   Not every private room goes for the hermetically sealed
esthetic. At Vong, the Thai Room, an slightly elevated platform in
the main dining room, cleverly lets in air, light and sound while
creating a sense of intimacy with a border of wooden louvers around
a long green marble table that seats 12. It's all very civilized,
in a tropical way. The ambient noise of conversation and dinnerware
clatter floats through the louvers, but the Thai Room itself
maintains a serene, isolated integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the Thai Room in half, shut out the sight and sound, and you
get the Chef's Tasting Room at Union Pacific, where a maximum of
six diners are served the restaurant's tasting menu. The room,
perched on the mezzanine level, has the hushed, textured silence of
a confessional, an impression that's reinforced by the meshed
fabric that foils any attempt to peer in. Diners sit on a black
cloth banquette that runs around three sides of a small copper
table. A star-shaped hanging light casts a small circle of
illumination on the table surface.
</P>
<P>
   For diners who want to be far from the madding crowd, this is
about as far as it gets. Everybody else will be ready to sign up
for an early-release program.

   NEW YORK _ ``So, I don't know, what should I tell him?'' asked
the young woman during dinner at Frank, a crowded little restaurant
in the East Village, after telling the sad tale of her unhappy
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   I had an opinion about her former boyfriend, but I kept it to
myself. After all, I didn't even know her name. I just happened to
be sitting at the next table.
</P>
<P>
   Short of pointing a telescope through your neighbor's window,
few experiences offer better access to the intimate details of
strangers' lives than dining in Manhattan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't had the pleasure of being squeezed onto a narrow
banquette where the tables are too close for comfort? Your mind may
be on your companion across from you, but you cannot avoid being
distracted by the couples sitting on either side. You overhear
their conversations, you inhale their perfume, you can almost taste
their food. And woe betide you if a cellular phone chirps, as
diners dig into their pockets or bags, elbows cocked and ready to
do damage.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine, even five years ago, dining in such
cramped quarters. But today, with rents soaring and restaurants
booming, restaurateurs feel justified squeezing in an extra table
or two _ even if it means the difference between convivial and
claustrophobic. And New Yorkers, who are happy just to get a table
in the first place, are putting up with being packed into dining
rooms with an almost biological efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's New York,'' sighed Charles Morris Mount, who has
designed restaurants all over the country. ``It's the battle of the
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one accustomed to squeezing into tiny apartments
and crowded subways would expect throne-like accommodations in a
restaurant. You wouldn't even want them in places like Jean Claude
or Balthazar, bustling French bistros where the tight tables
contribute to the air of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   But at restaurants like Frank or Palmetta Plantation House on
the Upper East Side, small, inexpensive places where food may be
worth the discomfort, the jostling and crowding come dangerously
close to ruining the meal.
</P>
<P>
   At the best of Manhattan's midpriced restaurants, from Nick &AMP;
Toni's Cafe near Lincoln Center to Jo Jo on the Upper East Side to
EQ in Greenwich Village, you can expect banged knees and other
close encounters.
</P>
<P>
   At EQ, a chic restaurant where tables are placed like puzzle
pieces to fit in the tiny dining room, a stout man sitting at the
round center table one recent night leaned back in after-dinner
repose and was practically in the lap of a diner against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big round table, the dimension was made wrong,'' Dennis
Foy, the chef and co-owner, fumed. ``It was supposed to be a
54-inch round, and it's a 60-inch round, which is standard. I lost
six inches of floor space, and that infuriated me.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though you would expect more luxurious restaurants to
be more comfortable, some of the fancier places like Osteria del
Circo lack elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question a restaurateur asks is, `How many seats can
I put in?''' said Adam Tihany, who designed Osteria del Circo and
Le Cirque 2000 and who owns the restaurant Remi. ``It's the cost of
real estate _ how much money can you squeeze out per square foot?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other considerations. Like the city's fire
and building codes. While the city does not specify the number of
people a restaurant can serve, it does require that restaurants
maintain clear three-foot corridors leading to exits. The city
divides restaurants into two categories, Tihany said. Those that
seat 74 or more people are required to have two exits, with aisles
that are clearly identified. Those with fewer than 74 seats don't
need two exits, but still must have unobstructed aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Before a restaurant opens, it presents its plan for approval to
the city's Buildings Department and Fire Department. Once approved,
said Vincent Falcone, a fire protection plan examiner in the Fire
Department, further inspections are rare, usually only when
somebody complains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't check to see if tables have enough distance,''
Tihany said. ``They don't care if the operator crams people in as
long as there is a way to get out in case of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   While that probably is small comfort to diners, it is a good
thing for restaurant owners, because economics often dictate the
need for a higher seating capacity. As uncomfortable as crowded
restaurants may be, they ultimately indicate a healthy industry and
a healthy economy. Where were the crowds 10 years ago, after the
1987 stock market crash, when restaurant after restaurant went
under?
</P>
<P>
   And though there are no figures for restaurants alone,
Garrick-Aug Associates, an agency that specializes in store
leasing, reported that the average retail rent _ including
restaurants _ has risen steadily over the last two years, to $66 a
square foot from $51, while the availability of space has dropped.
``Obviously, the higher the rent, you either have to serve more
meals or raise prices,'' Tihany said. ``If the market won't bear
higher prices, you have to add more people.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true of smaller, less-known restaurants,
which, without advertising or high profile, must create a buzz to
attract more customers. Nothing brings in more people like a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Activity is a key to more activity,'' Alan Mannarelli, who
builds and finances downtown restaurants, said. ``Other than
Chanterelle, who doesn't cram in as many tables as they can?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Frank cannot be accused of neglecting even the
littlest nook or cranny in squeezing 40 or so seats into its tiny,
310-square-foot space. You had better be prepared to enjoy your
neighbor's conversation along with your insalata Caprese, or you
won't enjoy Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create an intimacy,'' said Roy Docouto, who built
Frank with the owner, Frank Prisinzano. ``At other places, you're
alone at your table. We wanted people to feel as if they were
sitting at the same table together. Strangers have become friends
here. It promotes a sense of, `Say hello to your neighbors.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Frank is making a virtue of necessity. But
others do the same by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain energy to a dining room, and if tables get
too far apart, they lose that energy,'' said David Rockwell, a
designer whose restaurants include Nobu and Payard Patisserie and
Bistro. At Payard, for example, the three dining areas have
distinct seating schemes: Tiny cafe tables and hard chairs packed
into the bakery area, intended for quick bites; a bistro area, with
larger tables, that is lively but cramped and noisy, and a more
spacious, sedate area on the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a restaurant's concept?'' Tihany asked. `'Is it an
urban bistro? Four-star dining? Relaxed trattoria? Each of these
concepts has a certain energy that dictates the seating.''
</P>
<P>
   While New York restaurateurs _ at all levels _ usually have more
ambition than space, this can inspire creative solutions. EQ is
almost a textbook example of a small downtown restaurant making the
best of a tight space. Foy also designed the dining room, which
needed to seat around 40 people in 400 square feet. EQ's wide
chairs, with their fawn-colored leather seats, are roomy and
luxurious, and the lighting is warm and inviting, showing off the
fish motif of the cloth banquettes and the subtle pattern of the
carpet. But even the finest materials could not extend the
dimensions of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I had to use every square inch,'' Foy said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rectangular dining room, broken up only by a small
bar near the entrance, feels comfortable, though not quite
spacious. But maintaining that level of comfort requires the stars,
and the diners, to align perfectly. For example, the banquette
along one wall seats 20 people. Banquette tables generally
accommodate groups of two and four. Two tables for two eat up more
space than one table for four because the tables must be separated.
</P>
<P>
   EQ tries to leave about 18 inches between banquette tables, said
its architect, Vincenzo Fressola, roomier than the 6 inches typical
of bistros but not quite the 2 feet of luxury restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, fate intervenes, as it did recently when
every table was occupied by a couple. Handbags banged into water
glasses, and it took real maneuvering to get out of the banquette
to go to the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite the banquette and between the bar and the kitchen is a
cozy alcove that seats 10 along three walls, with a table for six
in the middle of the floor. With each table occupied, a waiter
reciting specials to one must do an intricate pas de deux with
another waiter who arrives with food for the neighboring table.
Their practiced steps allow them to stay out of each other's way,
but trying to follow the waiter's recitation as he dances back and
forth is dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   Designers, Tihany said, begin planning a layout by deciding on
the size of the tables for two. Typically, he said, these are 24
inches wide by 27 inches deep in a bistro or trattoria, and 32
inches wide by 36 inches deep in a luxury restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Fancier restaurants generally require bigger tables for the
simple reason that they have more stuff to fit on their thick white
tablecloths. You may have no use for a fish fork, but there it is,
along with a battalion of wine glasses, butter knives and bread
plates, to say nothing of cellular phones and, of course, the
check. A simpler restaurant doesn't need to accommodate so much
equipment. Bread can sit on the table rather than on its own plate;
the same forks can be used for salad and steak.
</P>
<P>
   Oversize plates, made so popular in the nouvelle cuisine days,
are another enemy of tiny tables, but chefs still seem too willing
to sacrifice table space so they can display their artistic
squiggles of sauce and tossed herbs. Needless to say, simple
arithmetic makes clear that 12-inch luxury plates, to say nothing
of the 14-inch monsters, create a logjam on the tables of a bistro.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how carefully the tables and layout are planned, the
restaurant experience still depends on the characteristics of a
space. Osteria del Circo, which is run by the three sons of Sirio
Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, is pretty tightly packed.
``The kids liked it tight,'' Tihany, the designer, said. ``They
wanted to feel the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dining room is half empty, it can be low-key and
pleasant, but as the room gets crowded and the energy bubbles, the
high ceilings seem to throw sound back toward the floor, making
conversations at nearby tables easier to hear than your own.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the new Le Cirque 2000 is more spacious than the
notoriously tight original, but it too can feel cramped, especially
when a series of couples sit elbow to elbow along the banquette in
the rear room near the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If highly designed restaurants like Le Cirque and Circo
represent one typical New York experience, the tiny restaurants
that line Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village are another. On a
recent Saturday night, restaurants like Le Gigot, Pearl Oyster Bar,
Little Havana, Home and Po seemed as crowded as the sidewalks
outside, where pedestrians in a hurry took to the streets to
squeeze past the masses. As in many New York restaurants, the
design is ultimately decided by the constraints of the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ambiance created by the coziness of the space is somehow
related to its success,'' said David Page, an owner of Home, a
stylish little American restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Home can seat 32 people at the handmade varnished wood tables in
its dining room _ make that 32 average-size people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the booths as big as possible, given the space we
had,'' Page said. ``But if your waist line is bigger than, say, 40
inches, it's impossible.''

SMILE, YOU ARE BEING WATCHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of that great philosopher, Michael Jackson, lately
``I always feel like somebody's watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's probably because they are watching me ... and you, too.
Has anyone else noticed the incredible number of surveillance
cameras strewn about the ceilings of America? Good grief, a person
can hardly pick their nose or pull out a wedgie without it getting
caught on tape.
</P>
<P>
   How did it all come to this, I ask you? Most of our jails are
bursting at the seams, but there are still enough criminals on the
streets to make our lives one continuous episode of ``Candid
Camera.'' When I was a youngster, ``Jack'' referred to a male human
or a small, metal object used in a children's game. Now, to be
``jacked'' or ``jacked up'' is a slang term for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite anecdotes involves an elderly woman who drove
up and over a curb to avoid being carjacked by several young men
who had used their vehicles to block a city street. Next, we'll all
have surveillance cameras mounted on our rearview mirrors like the
police patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, just think about it. There is no way in the world that
anyone who ventures more than a few feet beyond their front door
could ever be without an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, Bill, can you tell us where you were yesterday between 8
a.m. and 4 p.m.?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me see. When I left home, I stopped by the
convenience store and got a cup of coffee. I'm sure they had a
camera in there. Then I went to the bank and deposited my check.
They had a bunch of cameras around the cashiers. I arrived at the
department store where I'm the manager in the jewelry department
around 9 a.m. We have a time and date stamp on our tapes if you
want to check it out. Hmmm, during my lunch hour, I went to the
airport to pick up my sister and the attendant took down my license
plate number and videotaped me as I entered and left the airport. I
dropped her off and went back to work. I didn't get off until seven
because Susie, the night manager, was home sick with the flu. You
know, you might want to question her. If the burglar was wearing a
mask, you don't know if it's a male or a female. Yeah, check with
Susie. She's got those beady eyes and she always brings her lunch
to work. I don't know where she was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, a gal would have to be mighty reclusive in order not to
leave a neon trail all over town every day. Even your phone records
can peg your location. Now, my husband wants to get some device
called Lo Jack installed on our cars. With Lo Jack, the authorities
can determine the whereabouts of your vehicle 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I like the theft deterrent and vehicle recovery aspects of
it. However, I do not want my family to know exactly where I am
every minute of the day! Aren't the pager and the cell phone enough
already? No, I'm not doing anything clandestine, but maybe I'm not
at the grocery store for two hours. Maybe I stopped by for a quick
espresso before I returned home. Maybe I got off work a little
early and stopped by the shoe sale at the mall. Is that a crime?
</P>
<P>
   All I need is for my kids to get some homing device so they can
follow me all over town asking for more money. Or my husband. I can
just hear it now, paging me to death with stuff like, ``Honey, it
looks like you're near the sporting goods store. Stop by and get me
some more golf tees on your way home.''
</P>
<P>
   No! Enough is enough already. I've got too many eyes on me as it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Who was that other great philosopher who said, ``It ain't
paranoia if they're really after you?''

TOO FEW POLITICAL HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Joseph Lieberman rose on the Senate floor last
week to condemn the immoral behavior of his friend President
Clinton, the Democrat from Connecticut joined an illustrious but
exceedingly small pantheon of political nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, very few senators have shown the courage and
integrity to defy their party's leaders in full public view on a
matter of principle. These senators are worth remembering because
of the legacy of independence and the lesson in honorable
government that they leave us.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the bravest were Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Howard Baker
of Tennessee and Margaret Chase Smith _ all Republicans _ plus
Democratic Sen. William Fulbright of Arkansas. Each resisted great
pressure to conform to party policies they could not in good
conscience support or to defend a president they found
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   First, the case of Mark Hatfield, a respected 30-year
congressional veteran who had risen through seniority to become
chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the new GOP congressional majority gave passage of a
constitutional amendment to mandate a balanced federal budget its
highest priority. Every Senate Republican supported it, except
Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   He objected on principle to tinkering with the Constitution for
an accounting gimmick that could strangle legislative flexibility.
His colleagues leaned on him, lobbyists pressured him; Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, then the frontrunner for the 1996 GOP
presidential nomination, lectured him about party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans couldn't get enough Democratic support to pass
the amendment and it died for want of one vote. Furious GOP
freshmen, still giddy with their new power, demanded that Hatfield
be stripped of his chairmanship. A special GOP caucus was called to
debate Hatfield's future, while he sat isolated in the back of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members, concerned about the precedent that would be set
if a chairman were fired because of a vote, prevailed over the
hotheads. But Hatfield did not seek re-election the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Howard Baker, whose even-handed conduct as vice
chairman of the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973 helped build a
bipartisan consensus that President Richard M. Nixon had committed
impeachable crimes. The civility and cooperation between Baker and
Democratic chairman Sam Ervin is in sharp contrast to the political
grandstanding and distrust that has characterized the congressional
probes of Clinton's activities.
</P>
<P>
   On the infamous tapes, Nixon can be heard ordering then-Attorney
General John Mitchell to ``hold Baker's hand, baby-sit him''
through the hearings. That didn't have the desired effect, and
Nixon felt Baker's questioning was too soft on White House counsel
John Dean and too harsh on Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon vowed revenge against Baker. ``He'll never be in the White
House again...never, never, never, never,`` Nixon rants on the
tapes. ``He will never be on a presidential plane again...he owes a
great deal to all of us...we've done favors for him. He's not gonna
get away with this now...cut him off. Give him a big freeze...''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon resigned after the House Judiciary Committee recommended
his impeachment. Baker was eventually welcomed back to the White
House after all, as Ronald Reagan's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   William Fulbright, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman,
was among the very first Democrats to protest the Vietnam war _ and
was the most persistent and most influential senatorial critic. He
held crucial hearings into the war's escalation in February 1966,
only seven months after President Lyndon B. Johnson made the major
commitment that foreclosed easy retreat by increasing U.S. combat
troops from 75,000 to 125,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Fulbright were long-time buddies and political
allies, as were Clinton and Lieberman. Fulbright originally
supported the war but as it spread and consumed American lives he
concluded that ``we don't belong there'' _ a conclusion Johnson
himself would reach, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Fulbright kept pressing Johnson for peace initiatives, alone at
first but ultimately backed by a majority of both the public and
the politicians. Johnson was furious, calling Fulbright a ``cry
baby'' and complaining that `it's easier to satisfy Ho Chi Minh
than Bill Fulbright.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, after the war ended, Fulbright was accused of devoting
more time to foreign affairs than local problems and was defeated
for re-election in the Democratic primary by Gov. Dale Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching back to 1950, we find Margaret Chase Smith making her
first major speech on the Senate floor decrying the anti-Communist
witchhunting tactics of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. She was right about
McCarthy's assault upon individual civil rights but ahead of her
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1954 did McCarthy's subcommittee hold the raucous
hearings into fantasized communist ties of Army officials that
provoked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to finally speak out
against McCarthy. The Senate then condemned him for behavior
``contrary to senatorial traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the first woman to serve in both chambers of Congress,
was initially elected to the House in 1944 to fill a vacancy caused
by her husband's death, just about the only path to power for a
woman in that era. She was elected to the Senate four years later.
In 1964 she became the first woman to be nominated for president by
a major party, receiving 27 votes at a GOP convention that gave the
nod to Sen. Barry Goldwater.

LE BERNARDIN: A TALE OUT OF BRITTANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Le Bernardin has dazzled New York and changed the way Americans
think about fish since the day it opened in the winter of 1986. The
restaurant's achievement came not just from talent in the kitchen
or the dining room. It took an unusual brother-sister act.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Le Bernardin Cookbook: Four Star
Simplicity'' by Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert (Doubleday, $30), Ms.
Le Coze, who founded the restaurant with her brother, Gilbert,
tells the trans-Atlantic tale of how Le Bernardin came to be in
vivid, often surprisingly intimate terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that pays tender homage to the spirit of Le Coze,
who died in 1994 at age 49. He and Maguy, who grew up working in
the family's restaurant and hotel in Brittany, were always close.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually escaped their provincial hometown and their
stern, demanding father to make their way, successfully, in Paris,
and eventually in New York. Ms. Le Coze recalls that as children
just after World War II, she and her brother were often sent to eat
at a neighbor's house when her parents were busy.
</P>
<P>
   They hated it, because the soup and main course were eaten from
the same bowl, then the bowl was flipped over to use the bottom for
dessert. As much as the children loved dessert, they refused to eat
it.
</P>
<P>
   After the sudden death of her alter ego, Ms. Le Coze was able to
continue in business and to keep the four-star flag whipping
triumphantly in the breeze, largely because of the bond that had
developed between Le Coze and Ripert, who joined the restaurant in
1991 as executive chef.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ripert enters the picture when it's time to cook.
Useful advice about buying and handling seafood and other
ingredients is followed by a wealth of recipes, most of which are
explained by a bit of written dialogue between Ms. Le Coze and
Ripert.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both reminisce about their childhoods when
discussing a pot-au-feu made with red snapper, and they talk about
how every day at noon, they scarf down toasted bread slathered with
the restaurant's fresh and smoked salmon spread.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipes serve four, and many require two large
10-inch skillets or saucepans to prepare. The recipes are easily
divided to serve two, but harder to increase. Because these are
restaurant recipes, they often call for popping something into a
very hot oven for just a minute, a technique familiar to few home
cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the restaurant's tricks, like sprinkling salt, herbs and
lemon juice from several inches above the plate to apply them more
evenly, are revealed. And I was very happy to learn that it was
necessary to butter the bowl when preparing the utterly delicious
sea scallops in chive nage, so that the slices of sea scallops
don't stick to the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes include the restaurant's classics, like the halibut
in warm vinaigrette, the fricassee of shellfish and the monkfish
with savoy cabbage, as well as some of Ripert's own inspirations,
like grouper with spiced zucchini and red pepper confit.
</P>
<P>
   I tried a number of recipes, both simple, like the irresistible
shrimp broiled with garlic butter, and complex, like the pistou
vegetable soup with mussels.
</P>
<P>
   The only flaw I found in those I tried was the reference to a
sauce in step 4 of the pan-roasted salmon with red wine-lentil
sauce. The only liquid in the recipe was drained from the cooked
lentils. It was thin, and there was far too much of it. So I
reduced it, swirled in some of the butter intended to dress the
lentils, and I had a fine red wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of desserts, including a simple bitter
chocolate souffle cake, and the famous variations on caramel, a
signature dessert of Le Bernardin. But Ms. Le Coze has some advice
for readers: ``It's a pain in the neck to make, as you can see. My
suggestion is, don't do it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRESH AND SMOKED SALMON SPREAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 ablespoons chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 easpoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh salmon fillet, fat trimmed, cut in 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces smoked salmon, fat trimmed, cut into tiny dice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   \ cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise, homemade or prepared
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Toasted baguette slices, for serving. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place wine, shallots and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a large
saucepan, and bring to a boil. Add the fresh salmon, and poach for

   McDowell Valley Vineyards Marsanne 1997, Mendocino County,
Calif. About $16.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, McDowell Valley Vineyards discovered that a
longstanding block of petite sirah in its vineyards was the real
thing, syrah. Since then, McDowell has concentrated more and more
on grapes of the Rhone Valley, including a plot of marsanne.
</P>
<P>
   Marsanne is a rather overwhelming grape in France, where it
produces white St.-Joseph and white Crozes-Hermitage. And along
with its more refined cousin, roussanne, it is an important
constituent in Hermitage Blanc. In California, while still a
full-bodied wine, marsanne is less aggressive and more perfumed. It
conveys a taste of melons and makes an interesting pairing with
strong-flavored fish and with Chinese and Thai dishes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CUAUTLA, Mexico _ Carmen Genis flipped open her cellular
telephone and punched in a private number few citizens possess in
this corruption-weary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this my governor?'' Genis asked politely but without
deference. ``Governor, I don't want to waste time . . . We must do
something to clean up the police.''
</P>
<P>
   A businesswoman and feisty community activist, Genis is one of
the more aggressive leaders of a citizens' movement against
corruption and crime that is flourishing in Morelos state, just
south of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over crime -- too often committed by people charged with
preventing it _ is spreading through Mexico, where almost daily the
public is treated to new revelations about crooked police chiefs,
corrupt bankers and dirty politicians. The suspects are accused of
fleecing public funds or protecting criminals for their own gain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has always suffered from corruption, said Augusto Sanchez
Sandoval of Mexico City's National Institute of Criminal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is more clarity now because opposition parties are
stronger and are uncovering what's been going on for years,'' he
said. ``From total darkness we are now getting pinpoints of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, a survey on Mexican justice published by the Mexico
City newspaper Reforma showed that 54 percent of those people
polled thought the government was having no success at stopping
corruption. Only 5 percent said the government was doing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin-based anti-corruption group Transparency
International placed Mexico as the sixth most corrupt country out
of 52 nations on its 1997 Corruption Perception Index. The index is
based on surveys of international business people's experiences and
countries' effectiveness at fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Morelos, ground zero for Mexico's anti-corruption sentiment, is
a small province that takes pride in its pleasant weather and its
native son, Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. But lately the
state has also become infamous as a den for corrupt authorities who
have looked the other way or participated in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious of these crimes are kidnappings, not just of
wealthy businessmen but also of ordinary citizens forced to scrape
together ransom money to free loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morelos where Mexico's most notorious kidnapper, Daniel
Arizmendi, thrived. Once a Morelos cop, he is now in custody after
federal officials arrested him and his gang last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also in custody in connection with kidnapping charges is the
chief of Morelos' anti-kidnapping police unit, Armando Martinez
Salgado, believed to have provided protection to Arizmendi.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Miyazawa Alvarez, chief of Morelos' state Judicial Police,
and the state's former attorney general, Carlos Peredo Merlo, have
also been charged with crimes in connection with kidnapping and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, as scandal mounted in Morelos, citizens like Carmen
Genis and opposition political parties began to demand the ouster
of the state's governor, Jorge Carrillo Olea. Carrillo, a member of
the dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), had also been
linked to cocaine traffickers in press reports and in court
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In March, opposition political groups staged a non-binding
referendum with 100,000 participants mostly demanding Carrillo's
resignation. After dismissing the vote as a stunt and attacking his
critics as troublemakers, Carrillo finally gave in. He resigned in
May without admitting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Genis, a travel agent in Cuautla (pronounced: Kwowt-la), a small
city south of Morelos' capital, Cuernavaca, said her hometown has
been traumatized by police-supported crime and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down Cuautla's main avenue, she points at various store
fronts a hardware store, a fertilizer shop, a market that sells
chiles -- and describes how entire families have been kidnapped for
repeated ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims have gone broke paying ransoms or left town,
terrified of being targeted again or disgusted with Morelos'
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Mendoza, who was kidnapped from his family's store three
years ago when he was 21, says he'll never feel safe again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working behind the counter when two men showed up,'' he
said. ``I saw them take guns out. They said, 'We're Judicial
Police. You are detained.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza doesn't think they were lying. He believes police were
involved in his kidnapping, although it was never proved. He was
held for 19 days and threatened with death unless his family paid
the equivalent of $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings haven't stopped since the arrest of Morelos' corrupt
top cops.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, Silvino Valdez and his family were working in their
modest seafood restaurant in the city of Jojutla, south of Cuautla.
</P>
<P>
   Six men entered the restaurant, brandished guns and dragged away
Valdez's 15-year-old son, Jaime. The kidnappers drove the boy to a
remote area, made him place his knees on a hot car engine and
burned his flesh nearly to the bone to prevent him from escaping.
</P>
<P>
   They tied the boy to a tree, and later placed him inside a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is incomparable,'' said Valdez, his eyes
still dull from shock. ``These people hit you where you are
weakest,''
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers demanded about $250,000 in ransom, but a
desperate Valdez begged the men to let his son go for close to
$40,000. He had to raise the money from friends and by selling his
two cars.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez called the police, who he said appeared not to care.
</P>
<P>
   Through his own research, Valdez discovered the kidnappers were
using the same phone booth to repeatedly place calls demanding
ransom. The police were asked to watch the booth, he said, but
never did their duty.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime was released after eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for justice, Valdez asked a police officer to investigate
leads on cars and houses where Jaime had been held.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officer came to my house and looked around the
place as if he were sizing it up, to see how much money I had,''
Valdez said. ``He told me I should just forget about it all, that
there wasn't anything they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez isn't sure if police were directly involved in his son's
kidnapping. But he believes one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I had given them some money,'' he said bitterly,
``they would have done their job. But by that time I had no money
left to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Genis became involved in the Morelos citizens group Civic Cause
after stories like this began circulating several years ago. She
estimates that some 400 kidnappings have taken place in Morelos,
many in the Cuautla area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out these kidnappers were being protected,'' she
said. ``We became detectives.''
</P>
<P>
   She described how a family's home was invaded by masked men who
seized one of the members. The family summoned state police, only
to discover that the police ended up helping to load the kidnapping
victim into a car after the masked men identified themselves as
cops.
</P>
<P>
   Genis and others identified police cars that were seen at the
scene of kidnappings and safe houses that were used to hold
victims, and sent incriminating information to the governor's
office. The activists began to meet quietly with federal law
enforcement officials in Mexico City, imploring them to investigate
corrupt state cops and their association with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an incredible symbiosis here,'' said Gerardo Becerra
of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, whose members were
part of the campaign to oust the former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Genis regards Carrillo's resignation as an unprecedented victory
for a citizens' movement in Mexico. Now she's trying to work with
the newly appointed governor, pressuring him to probe the suspected
looting of public funds and continued police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is getting rid of the old governor. The other is
getting justice. And that hasn't changed,'' she said. ``Delinquency
continues intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial representatives in Morelos did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Genis said at least three kidnapping rings still operate in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Mexico's most wanted kidnapper, Daniel Arizmendi, is in
custody, Genis said, federal officials have said they will
concentrate on nabbing other criminals in Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what they do,'' she said.

TEXAS MAY LOSE TREASURED ALAMO DIARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas history buffs are worried that a Mexican officer's
myth-shattering account of Davy Crockett's capture and execution
after the battle of the Alamo may fall into the hands of a dreaded
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The diary, which has been privately owned by Texans since 1974,
will be auctioned Nov. 18 in California. It's expected to fetch
$250,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just afraid it will end up in the Bancroft Library in
California or, worse yet, at Yale,'' complained Stephen L. Hardin,
author of ``Texian Iliad'' and a professor at Victoria College. ``I
don't want the Yankees to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the diary ends up, a debate over its
authenticity is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett's diehard fans have denounced it as a 20th century
forgery, an elaborate hoax that disputes their belief that the
coonskin-capped frontiersman went down fighting at the Alamo in
March 1836.
</P>
<P>
   But many academics accept it as a circa 1840 narrative penned or
dictated in Mexico City's Inquisition Prison by Lt. Col. Jose
Enrique de la Pena, who was jailed for backing the wrong
general-politician after the Texas War of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Only a page of the diary is devoted to Crockett's demise; the
rest of the 200 pages detail de la Pena's complaints about his
superiors' incompetence and cruelty during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it is that one page that most interests many Texans.
</P>
<P>
   According to de la Pena, Crockett and six others were captured
after the Alamo ``skirmish'' and brought before Gen. Antonio Lopez
de Santa Anna, who immediately ordered them executed. When a unit
of engineers didn't budge, officers aiming to please the general
moved in and hacked the seven to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thrust themselves forward, in order to flatter their
commander, and with swords in hand, fell upon these unfortunate,
defenseless men just as a tiger leaps upon his prey,'' the account
says. ``Though tortured before they were killed, these unfortunates
died without complaining and without humiliating themselves before
their torturers.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial diary has been held until recently at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope the document stays in Texas,'' said Hardin, a
Texas history specialist who earned his doctorate at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth. ``I think it's vitally
important. It's part of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers are owned by Ruby Peace, 74, whose late husband,
former state Democratic Party chairman James Peace, bought them
from a Mexico City rare coin dealer in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling it for the money, first of all,'' said her son,
James Peace III, a San Antonio bookseller. ``We'd have been more
receptive to keeping it here, but for all the people calling,
coming by. I've been interviewed about 10 times, been on the BBC.
It's fine for a while, but it's not my avocation to be a Davy
Crockett buff.''
</P>
<P>
   The first report of the diary was in 1955 when a Mexico City
coin dealer, Jesus Sanchez Garza, issued a small Spanish-language
edition, ``La Rebelion de Texas.'' It made few ripples until Texas
A&AMP;M University Press published a 1975 English translation, ``With
Santa Anna in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another A&AMP;M book based on the diary, the 1978 ``How Did Davy
Die?'' by Dan Kilgore, raised the emotional temperature, leading to
hyperbolic denunciations of the late author as a hero-destroying
communist.
</P>
<P>
   Also spawned was an entire book aimed at exposing the account as
a fraud, the 1994 ``Defense of a Legend: Crockett and the de la
Pena Diary'' by Bill Groneman, a New York City Fire Department
captain and respected Alamo researcher.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as March, CBS-TV anchor and native Texan Dan Rather
criticized a New York Times book reviewer for not seeing de la
Pena's motives as self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   But Groneman concedes that university historians overwhelmingly
accept the diary as real. Only a handful of independent researchers
such as Groneman still question it for lack of ``provenance,'' or
record of ownership, before 1955 and for using 20th century terms
like ``crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   James Crisp, a North Carolina State University historian who
wrote the introduction to the latest edition of ``With Santa
Anna,'' counts himself among the believers. Yet even he would feel
more assured if costly forensics tests determined just when the ink
was applied to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who believe the diary is authentic would be
vindicated,'' Crisp said from Raleigh, N.C. ``We would welcome the
tests.''
</P>
<P>
   No need, says Greg Shaw, director of books and manuscripts at
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, which will auction the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts, and his firm, agree that it is real, Shaw said
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hardin said $250,000 is a lot for papers with a
questionable pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important stuff,'' he said. ``Let's not mess around.
For the money they're asking, before I'd allow my institution to
drop that kind of coin, it should make ... sure it's tested.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEQUILA, Mexico _ Was it a mirage? In the sultry 95-degree heat,
the fields shimmered along the highway leading west from
Guadalajara, as if the hazy blue sky had tumbled to the earth and
splashed over the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   But the fields really WERE blue, covered with acres of steely
agave plants, the raw ingredient for one of the world's most
complex spirits _ tequila.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican state of Jalisco, the area from the Pacific coast
to the central highlands is tequila country. Like France's cognac,
Mexico's national spirit is also named for a place, the easy-going
colonial town of Tequila, about 30 miles from Guadalajara. All
around it are vast fields of blue agave, a primitive-looking, hardy
succulent that has been rooted in the volcanic soil of the region
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the world's entire supply of genuine tequila is
still made from the agave grown in Jalisco (pronounced ha-LEE-sko)
and in a few villages in some nearby states. And fine tequila _ the
herbaceous, subtly sweet, spicy spirit that is finding new
aficionados by the minute _ can be distilled from the juice of the
fine-grained cores, or hearts, of only one kind of agave: the blue
agave, or agave azul.
</P>
<P>
   This is tequila meant for sipping and savoring, instead of
downing as shots at beach bars. Many of the nearly 100 labels of
premium tequila are now available in stores for $10 to $100 and are
displayed in restaurants. The finest tequilas, meant for brandy
snifters, not blender drinks, are listed along with single-malt
scotches and rare cognacs in top restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tequila sales are way up at Mesa Grill,'' Laurence
Kretchmer said, referring to his restaurant in Manhattan, on lower
Fifth Avenue. ``People still order Cuervo Gold, but they're
starting to understand that there are better tequilas out there,''
added Kretchmer, the author of ``The Mesa Grill Guide to Tequila''
(Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Cuervo Gold, the colloquial name for Jose Cuervo's Cuervo
Especial, may be the world's most popular tequila, but it is tinted
with caramel and, more importantly, is not 100 percent blue agave.
And in tequila these days, the only passing grade is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A spirit made from agave was first mentioned in the writings of
Spanish monks in 1621. But long before then, the Aztecs knew that
by hacking off the spiky leaves of the agave plant, they could
expose the core and press the juice from it to make a mildly
alcoholic elixir. Pulque, a milky fermented homemade drink, is
similar.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish took the process one step further. They learned how
to distill alcohol from the Arabs, the inventors of distillation,
and introduced the technique in Mexico in the 16th century. A new
and highly intoxicating use was found for agave, which already went
into everything from roofing for houses to needles and thread.
</P>
<P>
   No one has figured out how to use machines to harvest agaves,
some of them five-foot-high sunbursts of spikes. Field hands called
jimadores, who know which ones are ready by color, pick them year
round.
</P>
<P>
   Using a coa, a handmade, razor-sharp, rounded blade attached to
a long pole, the jimador slashes off the leaves to expose the
large, pineapple-like core, called a pina, which can weigh from 20
to 100 pounds. Like many jimadores, Ismael Gama, who has worked for
Jose Cuervo for 27 years, is training his son to be a jimador.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Tequila and in nearby villages, producers like
Jose Cuervo and Herradura cook the starchy white pinas for at least
a day with steam in brick or concrete ovens that can hold 50 tons,
instead of in modern stainless-steel autoclaves. At La Rojena, the
elegant hacienda-like Cuervo distillery, founded more than 200
years ago, workers called horneros still carry the heavy pinas,
each split in half, on their heads to the ovens, or hornos.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pinas have been cooked, they turn deep amber and take
on a soft texture and candylike sweetness hinting of ginger and
citrus. Then they are crushed: the juice, called aguamiel, or honey
water, is separated from the pulp, fermented and then distilled
twice, usually in copper alembics, or pot stills. Tequilas are
often distilled at 110 proof, or 55 percent alcohol by volume, and
then diluted with water.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the spirit is made into one of four types of
tequila:
</P>
<P>
   _ Silver, sometimes called blanco (white), is unaged, clear
tequila. Many connoisseurs prefer it because it has the most
straightforward agave flavor, herbaceous with nuances of citrus,
sweetness and spice. The bright taste of a good silver tequila
makes it the best for mixed drinks. In tequila country, Mexicans
mix it with a lemon-lime soda called Squirt. Fine 100 percent blue
agave silver tequila is delicious chilled and sipped straight up,
like vodka, or on the rocks with a splash of fresh lime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gold tequila is merely unaged tequila tinted with caramel. Use
it in mixed drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reposado, or rested tequila, is usually a pale straw color
and, by Mexican law, is aged from 2 to 12 months. It is usually
slightly mellower than silver tequila. Some prefer it for cocktails
because the flavor is usually less assertive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, anejo, or aged tequila, which is held in wood
barrels, sometimes French oak, for more than a year, is gold to
amber and usually has a softer, vanilla-tinged flavor that evokes
cognac or armagnac. Anejo is the tequila to sip after dinner. Some
anejos have their color intensified with caramel. Tequila aged for
more than four years tends to lose flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these tequilas can be 100 percent blue agave _ and that
is the best indication of good quality. Mexican law permits tequila
to contain as much as 49 percent sugar (cane sugar is most common).
This ``mixto'' tequila accounts for 80 percent of Mexico's total
annual production of more than 100 million liters, even though the
production of 100 percent blue agave tequila has increased by 20
percent since 1995, according to ``The Book of Tequila'' by Bob
Emmons (Open Court Publishing, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The label on a bottle of tequila gives at least as much
information as one on a bottle of wine. Here is an example.
</P>
<P>
   TEQUILA: The type of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   RESERVA DE DON JULIO: The brand name.
</P>
<P>
   40 PERCENT ALC./VOL.: The proof; most tequilas sold in the
United States are 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol by volume.
</P>
<P>
   750 ML: The size of the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   SILVER: The type of tequila. Silver is unaged, clear tequila.
(Gold is unaged tequila tinted with caramel; reposado is aged from
2 to 12 months; anejo is aged in wood for a year or more.)
</P>
<P>
   100 PERCENT BLUE AGAVE: The fact that the tequila was made only
of blue agave; it is the best indication that it is good quality.
(Mixto tequilas are a blend of blue agave and as much as 49 percent
sugar, usually distilled cane sugar.)
</P>
<P>
   NOM 1118: The distillery registration number, which tells which
of the more than 300 distilleries registered by the Mexican
government produced it.
</P>
<P>
   CRT: Production supervised by Consejo Regulador del Tequila
(Tequila Regulatory Council).
</P>
<P>
   DO 84: The denomination of origin number (sometimes called DOT,
denomination of origin tequila), assigned by the Mexican
government, which shows that the tequila was made according to
Mexican regulations and bottled in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCED AND BOTTLED UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE MEXICAN
GOVERNMENT: Because this is a 100 percent blue agave tequila, it
had to be bottled in Mexico, by law.
</P>
<P>
   TEQUILA TRES MAGUEYES, ETC.: The name of the manufacturer and
its address.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT OF MEXICO: In the United States and in Europe, anything
called tequila must have been produced in Mexico, according to
trade agreements.

LATIN AMERICAN ROCK GETS ITS GREEN CARD  
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commerce with Latin America, the darling emerging market helped
along by NAFTA, is predicted to dwarf trade with Europe and Asia
combined within 15 years. We give them McDonald's and Windows, they
give us sugar, coffee, bananas, and . . . rock and roll. Say what?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has tossed the cultural Frisbee of
rock music south of the border, cultivating large followings in
places like Mexico City, where a Black Sabbath concert recently
drew thousands of Mexi-metalheads.
</P>
<P>
   That's to be expected. The world's citizens love American rock.
But nowhere do they love it more than in Latin America, where
they've turned it into a boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   Starting about 10 years ago, Latin American rock bands began
hurling their rock back at America -- bigger, brighter, and better,
in many cases. This wasn't the syrupy Spanish pap we were used to
avoiding on AM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   This was rock: hard-core, complex, virtuosic, experimental. The
lyrics spoke of political and social movements that made Kurt
Cobain's troubles look bo-ring. Where American rock seemed mired in
selfish suburban angst, Latin rock seemed outwardly political,
angry, and pumped. It came out sounding real, and Americans,
especially second- and third-generation Latinos longing for sounds
to define their experience, embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   The rock en espanol movement comes to Boston next week in full
force as two of the hottest acts take to area stages. The Mexican
band Mana (mah-NAH), the top-selling Latin rock band in the world,
originally was to play the Roxy, but is now booked at the larger
Avalon for Wednesday, as part of its 36-city American tour.
Newcomer Bloque (BLO-kay), a Colombian band that describes its own
music as ``psychotropical funk,'' plays tonight at the House of
Blues in Harvard Square and Sept. 19 at the Middle East Cafe in
Central Square, Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic sales of rock en espanol have increased fivefold in
just five years, according to Maribel Shumacher, vice president of
Warner Music's Latin American division. She credits changing
demographics and boredom with the usual American rock for this.
Tracking sales proves difficult, because organizations such as
Soundscan have not traditionally paid attention to the genre.
Shumacher's claims, however, are backed by preliminary numbers from
the Recording Industry Association of America, and by the creation
of the Latin rock/alternative category for the Grammy Awards last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Shumacher oversaw one of the first Latin rock tour in the States
in 1988, and says interest was minimal. But since that time, it has
become the music of choice for many Americans craving something new
-- and not just Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stern -- notoriously critical of Mexican music when
Selena died -- recently featured the Mexican rock-rap group Molotov
(sort of the Mexican Beastie Boys) on his show. Accused by a
conservative Mexican newspaper of ``polluting Mexico'' with its
``harmful and offensive . . . nasty musical production,'' the
controversial Molotov was a natural for Stern.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many compare America's blossoming affair with rock en
espanol to the British invasion, when bands like the Beatles and
the Rolling Stones dominated the American music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a commercial standpoint, it's comparable to the British
invasion of the '60s,'' Shumacher said. ``Why? Because people want
to hear something new and fresh. It's fascinating. I'm going to be
bullish about this, but that's because I'm in the thick of it, and
I know. I was at Mana's show in LA a couple of weeks ago, I was
incredibly impressed because it was the first time I saw a 70-30
breakdown. Thirty percent were Anglos -- I mean real Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   What does that say to me? That this stuff is crossing over. It's
slowly catching on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there could ever really be a mainstream crossover of
music in a language most Americans can't understand, Shumacher was
prepared with an answer: ``Let me ask you this. Do you enjoy
instrumental music? Do you understand more than half of the words
Green Day sing? No. But do you get the general meaning? Yes. I
mean, I love Alanis Morissette, but I don't understand 50 percent
of what she says. And it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the artists:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
MANA
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the rock en espanol movement is Mana, a
quartet from Mexico with a leonine lead singer named Fehr, whose
vocals are sometimes uncomfortably similar to Sting's. (Don't tell
Fehr. The comparison really upsets him.) Mana's music is melodic,
and draws on Mexican folk music and reggae as often as on the
Police. The group's lyrics speak of social problems such as teen
pregnancy and drug addiction. The band has used earnings to start
its own environmental watchdog group, Selva Negra (Black Forest).
Mana is credited with starting the Latin rock movement. Though
other groups, like heavy metal group Enanitos Verdes and Miguel
Mateos, both from Argentina, have been around since the early
1980s, Mana was the first Latin rock band to land an album on the
Billboard Top 200, where last year's ``Suenos Liquidos'' debuted at
No. 67. It has been certified gold twice in the States, selling
more than 500,000 copies. A previous album, ``Cuando Los Angeles
Lloran,'' also went gold in 1995, and was nominated for a Grammy in
the Spanish pop category; this was before the Latin rock category
was added.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Mana has sold more than 10 million records.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BLOQUE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bloque is the newest band on the scene; its debut album will not
be in stores until October. Made up of members of Carlos Vives's
Colombian band, Bloque released an announcement explaining that its
music is ``the result of something unique . . . searching.
Searching the garbage can where all Colombian music has been thrown
away for decades . . . Our music fills the immense black hole that
was created by the media revolution in the '60s . . .
</P>
<P>
   while Colombian people were busy trying to learn to dance to the
sound of the (expletive) Beach Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting music -- political, angry, danceable, brilliant --
is unlike anything yet recorded in the rock genre, a fact that got
the attention of David Byrne, who signed the group to his Luaka Bop
label.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Buenos Aires band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs last year was the
first band to win the Grammy in the Latin rock/alternative
category. Some say their album, ``Fabulosos Calaveras,'' won
because Mana's ``Suenos Liquidos'' came out two weeks too late to
be considered. But the band's horn-heavy ska-punk could have won
regardless. After all, no one in rock has a high, trembling voice
as imploring as that of lead singer and accordionist Gabriel
``Vincentio'' Fernandez Capello.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians who frequent Euro clubs will recognize Los Fabulosos
Cadillacs from their hit ``Matador,'' a dancy anthem about Victor
Jara, a young Chilean folk singer who was murdered in a military
coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillacs, who won an MTV Video Music Award in 1995, have
collaborated with artists from Ruben Blades to Debbie Harry. Spin
magazine said flatly that the Cadillacs were changing ``the future
of rock 'n' roll'' and Rolling Stone has called them ``rock en
espanol's most viable crossover dream.'' They toured this year with
the neo-swing band Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

ARMENIAN TREASURES: WHEN ART BECOMES A METAPHOR FOR IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ The art of the past is forever being
reinterpreted in terms of the politics of the present. The most
distinctive Armenian sculptures, for example, are heavy stone
crosses called khatchkars. The Armenians, having been driven away
or massacred by the Seljuk Turks, the Turkomans, the Arabs and
others on and off since ancient times, developed khatchkars partly
as a way to leave their mark in the land. Khatchkars are not easily
moved. They suggest the enduring presence of the Christian faith in
Armenia, even in the absence of the Armenians who erected them.
</P>
<P>
   So khatchkars are political symbols. Can they be interpreted in
other ways as well? Obviously, though politics seemed an inevitable
issue in the context of a big and excellent exhibition that was
here recently. Efi Andreadi, who organized the exhibition,
``Treasures of Armenia,'' explained that it was partly because
Greeks and Armenians share a traditional enemy in the Turks that
Armenian officials were inclined to lend to the show in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Was the exhibition therefore primarily meant to be a political
statement? No, Mrs. Andreadi insisted, but she did put a certain
spin on the art when she wrote in the preface to the show's catalog
about the Armenians, ``a people of diaspora,'' making, in addition
to khatchkars, small decorative objects ``which in every war,
persecution or exodus could be easily transported and saved from
the hands of the infidels.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if she hadn't said so, the inclination would have been
to see these works through that lens, simply because the show took
place here, meaning not just in Athens but in the arts center
called the Megaron, which itself can be regarded as a local
political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Art doesn't exist in a vacuum. It can be used to serve almost
any agenda. Caspar David Friedrich's paintings from the early 19th
century came to be linked during the early 20th with a distasteful
sort of German nationalism because they were admired by the Nazis.
Views of Friedrich changed accordingly. Shakespeare's plays were
mainstream entertainment in the 19th century in America, until a
new educated class made them into the theatrical equivalent of
spinach. Today we regard as highbrow what was once presented in the
context of of minstrel shows and magic acts: the perception of
Shakespeare's work has changed along with the context in which it
is performed.
</P>
<P>
   Context often means, more specifically, political context. This
being Greece, an obvious example is the Elgin marbles. Tourist
dollars aside, the Greeks have long said that they want the marbles
back to reunite the Parthenon sculptures on the site where they
came from. This is a matter of artistic integrity but, equally, a
matter of national identity, the Parthenon being the prime emblem
of Greek nationalism. The two ideas, artistic integrity and
national identity, are inextricably linked by the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   The British have made a similar argument: they point out not
only that they have better preserved the sculptures over the years
than the Greeks, but also that the sculptures have reshaped British
society since the 18th century, fueling a revival of interest in
Classical antiquity that, among other things, even alerted the
Greeks to the value of their own past. Hence the marbles are now
just as integral to British culture and history as they are to
Greek patrimony.
</P>
<P>
   With the show of Armenian art, the Megaron, as the site, helped
to shape a certain kind of interpretation. It is a place where
Greece's recent Spartan past has been replaced by an Athenian
present: construction began on the Megaron decades ago, but stopped
when a junta took control of the country in the late 1960s. The
military commandeered the site for army barracks, then stayed even
after the junta lost power in the mid-'70s. Finally, the barracks
were torn down, and the Megaron was completed several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a sign of the city's cultural aspirations. It is
Athens' version of New York's Lincoln Center, a performing arts
complex, but unlike Lincoln Center it also has an exhibition
program that seems unusually ambitious, considering that Mrs.
Andreadi must make do with a makeshift exhibition space.
``Treasures of Armenia,'' with more than 100 objects, was a major
installment in a series of shows she is planning about the
Byzantine world to be held more or less in the Megaron's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A large concert hall and a smaller one occupy much of the
building. The plan is to create more performing spaces and
conference rooms (money is raised by renting the place for
conventions) and a bigger music library. There wasn't a decent
music library in this entire region of the Mediterranean world
until the Megaron assembled one from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Athenians will tell you that the Megaron has entirely changed
the local cultural scene. Major orchestras used to come to Athens,
if at all, for an outdoor festival that took place once a year.
Today because of the Megaron Athens is on the circuit of European
cultural capitals, reflecting, perhaps, on a small scale, Greece's
larger desire to be an equal partner with the bigger nations in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Megaron, in other words, at least to a visitor, seems a
discreet emblem of a wider effort to impress on the world an image
of Athens as a major capital prepared for the spotlight of the
Summer Olympics in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In the Armenian exhibition, Mrs. Andreadi made a point of the
fact that, along with khatchkars, medieval ecclesiastical
architecture is at the core of Armenian civilization and identity.
Traditional Armenian churches are thick-walled stone buildings with
a central dome, their outlines usually tall and compressed. A few
stone models of the churches, which were made to decorate the
churches themselves, were in the show.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly claimed that these churches derive their shape
from Mount Ararat, Mrs. Andreadi said. Later I happened to come
across this passage in ``The Crossing Place: A Journey Among the
Armenians,'' by Philip Marsden:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ararat echoes around things Armenian like a persistent
refrain. It is the name of Armenian journals, Armenian books,
Armenian businesses and restaurants. In the United States there is
an Armenian credit card called Ararat, as is an Armenian nursing
home in California. The national football team is called Ararat.''
</P>
<P>
   Its particular importance, Marsden added, is as a political
symbol of exile, ``staring as it now does into Armenia from across
the Turkish border.''
</P>
<P>
   (This is the last article in a series about how different
cultures interpret and make use of the art of the past. The first
article examined restoration efforts in the old city, or medina, of
Fez, Morocco. The second article discussed the restoration of the
minbar, or pulpit, of the Kutubiyya mosque in Marrakesh.)

SORAYA 

</HEADLINE>
   TAKE-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 UNDATED: ... Poppin' Daddies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A brooding young Colombian guitarist, composer, and singer now
known only by her first name, Soraya is marketed as a Colombian
act. She is a powerful songwriter with introspective, poetic
lyrics, and her acoustic folk-rock sound is something like a
melding of Sarah McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, and Carole King. Her most
recent album, ``Wall of Smiles'' has been compared with King's
``Tapestry.'' Unlike many Latin rock acts, Soraya has chosen to
release her albums in Spanish and English, making her popular in
England and Germany, and landing her English singles on US rock
radio. Her songs have even been piped over speakers in a Pizzeria
Uno in Dedham. If the Lilith Fair ever sees fit to add a Latina
act, this would be the one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAFE TACUBA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico's Cafe Tacuba made headlines from the New York
Times to Newsweek when it performed in Central Park. Observed
Newsweek: ``a whole world of music crammed onto one stage . . .
what held this glorious mishmash together was a single, driving
principle: Cafe Tacuba rocked.'' The Miami Herald has called Tacuba
``one of the best bands in rock, period.'' It's true.
</P>
<P>
   This group has mastered the American alternative and hip hop
idioms, and remains fearless about folding in lounge, polka, funk,
and Latin American classics such as ``Ojala Que Llueva Cafe,'' a
merengue made famous by Dominican composer and singer Juan Luis
Guerra. It reached a wider audience in 1992 by playing at the Los
Angeles ``Lollapalooza'' and this year opened for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHAKIRA  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Soraya, Shakira is a one-name singer, composer, and
guitarist from Colombia. But that's where the similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   Shakira (Isabel Mebarak Ripoll), 21, has been recording
professionally since she was 13. At 19, Shakira released ``Piez
Descalzos,'' an album of sophisticated and mature pop rock songs
reminiscent of Natalie Merchant; it went platinum in Mexico,
Colombia, the States, and Venezuela, selling 900,000 copies in
Brazil alone. Her anguished alto moves across octaves in the style
of Sinead O'Connor and Alanis Morissette, without being as
annoying. Her guitar-playing is deft and determined, and her
compositions experiment with rhythms from Latin America and the
Middle East (her father is Lebanese).
</P>
<P>
   Because of her celebrity, Colombia declared her a goodwill
ambassador to the Vatican, where she met Pope John Paul this year.
He received her warmly, in spite of the lyrics of her song ``Se
Quiere, Se Mata,'' about a woman who dies after an illegal
abortion. Shakira's much-awaited new album, ``Donde Estan los
Ladrones?'', was released this month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
LA LEY  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Led by a 30-year-old singer, Alberto Cuevas, who spent 10 years
in Montreal, La Ley is the first rock band from Chile to make it
big on the rock en espanol scene, and the first to experiment with
hypnotic techno sounds. La Ley comes at rock from the INXS/Duran
Duran school, with a bit of a Depeche Mode sensibility. Cuevas, a
graphic artist who wears black nail polish and designs the band's
album covers, resents his original band being labeled a ``Latin
American act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be seen as citizens of the universe, and not be
prejudged because we are Latin Americans,'' he said from Santiago,
where he lives. ``I think all Latin rock bands are hoping to do in
America what American music did in Latin America in the '50s. We
didn't know what you were saying, but it didn't matter. The music
spoke for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOS ATERCIOPELADOS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the few woman-fronted rock en espanol bands,
Aterciopelados is quickly gaining on groups like Mana and the
Cadillacs. Lead singer Andrea Echiverri is considered by many
critics to be the best singer in the genre, period. With much of
her body pierced and with in-your-face feminist lyrics, Echiverri
has disproved the former industry assumption that there was no room
for women in the machismo world of Latin rock. Watching her
sold-out shows, it's hard to believe that women were literally
booed from Latin rock stages as recently as the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   From a wealthy Colombian family, Echiverri comes at her
rebellious stance from a debutante's background. Under her lead,
the band was nominated for the Latin rock Grammy last year, along
with four all-male bands. More than any other female artist to
date, Echiverri has revolutionized the rock en espanol revolution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOLOTOV &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wildly popular throughout Latin America, the rock-rap band
sounds a lot like the Beastie Boys -- and about a million other
American copycats. What sets them apart is language -- Spanish --
and culture -- Mexican. With two bassists who rap, the group is
loud, crude, curses a lot, and, when it attempts to rap in English,
shows its heavy imitation of misogynist American faux-gangstas like
Snoop Dog. In the land musically defined by corny balladeers like
Luis Miguel and Alejandro Fernandez -- who still appear onstage in
velvet mariachi outfits -- these nasty boys with the baggy pants
have caused quite a stir, something like the early days of Madonna,
when the Christian Coalition was out in full protest. Interesting
from a historical but not necessarily musical point of view.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
OTHER BANDS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are literally hundreds of rock en espanol bands. Here are
some of them: Madita Vecindad y Los Hijos del Quinto Patio, famous
for its song ``Pachuco,'' is one of the first Mexican bands to
document the downside of urban life in Mexico City; lead singer
Roco howls through lyrics about police brutality; the group has
used its popularity to raise money for Indians in Chiapas. Julieta
Venegas is a classical pianist from Tijuana who took up the
accordion and then made it rock; as the former keyboardist for the
punk band Tijuana No, Venegas has gone solo in a big, feminist way.
She, along with fellow Mexicana rocker Ely Guerra, have begun a
Mexican version of the Lilith Fair, called De Diva Voz (In the
Diva's Voice).
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's Fito Paez is the only singer on the scene doing
moody rock operas, and has been compared to David Bowie. Andres
Calamaro is another Argentine solo artist; he looks like Bob Dylan
with a stylist, and turned a childhood filled with military horrors
into a successful rock career; his new debut album, called ``Alta
Suciedad,'' is a word play on ``high society'' that comes out
meaning ``high trash.'' Argentina's Soda Stereo was a
U2-sound-alike that broke up recently but still has some nice discs
out there; and Todos Tus Muertos is one of Argentina's top
speed-metal slam bands.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be excluded from the rock en espanol roster are acts from
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes del Silencio is a pure thrash-metal band whose lead
singer sounds like a thundering Satan on speed.

   Several American rockers have come out with their own rock en
espanol projects. Lysa Flores is a guitarist and singer from Los
Angeles who dresses like a mariachi girl and proceeds to crank the
distortion and wail like Janis Joplin; her music and acting were
featured in the film ``Star Maps.'' King Chango is one of the
hottest new Latin rock bands, made up of New Yorkers with
Venezuelan roots. Puerto Rico's best-known rocker is former Menudo
member Robi Draco Rosa.

TRAVELERS BECOME THEIR OWN AGENTS THROUGH ON-LINE SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Kahler's lady friend, Paula, is a travel agent, so you
can imagine the conversations they have had since he became a
convert to do-it-yourself on-line travel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of it is you call it up, and it shows you all the
rates. You are not at the mercy of what they quote you _ you're not
in a negotiating session with a reservation clerk,'' Kahler said.
``It's so simple. Boom, boom, boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahler, a retiree who lives in Venice, Fla., is the voice of the
informed consumer taking charge _ exactly what the expanding world
of on-line travel wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are extraordinary: In 1997, $777 million in on-line
airline bookings were made in the United States, according to
Jupiter Communications in New York, a media research firm. It is
expected that 1998 will end with $1.7 billion in bookings; by 2002
the figure is projected to be $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers still pale in comparison to the total sales of U.S.
travel agents _ $120 billion in 1997, up from $110 billion in 1996
_ who handle 80 percent of airline tickets and 95 percent of cruise
arrangements. Still, we are witnessing the nascent stirrings of
what may be a remarkable transformation in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming upon an age of a new kind of consumer, one with
unprecedented access to product and service information,'' said Ken
Orton, president of San Francisco-based Preview Travel Inc. ``One
of the tools that has enabled that is the World Wide Web. You can
research products and gather all the information you need so that
when it is time to transact, you are a completely different kind of
buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com) employs 240 people and is
one of the three leading on-line travel service providers for
leisure and small-business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel and the other leaders in the emerging industry,
Fort Wort, Texas-based Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) and
Microsoft's Expedia (expedia.msn.com), along with scores of others
competing for market share, are competing with the old standard by
which producers of goods and services ``pushed out information
through a sales channel and really controlled what the consumer
saw,'' Orton said. Things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era the consumer has flipped the tables. The consumer
is in control of the transaction,'' Orton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parsons, publisher of Arlington, Texas-based Best Fares
Discount Travel magazine and the operator of www.bestfares.com,
still likes hearing the sound of a travel agent's voice,
``particularly when something goes wrong,'' but he sees the
handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the consumer needs to be more savvy, and they better
start to learn to use a computer because, if not, they are only
getting one of many products that could be offered to them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of shots are being fired between the highly competitive
on-line travel providers. Orton predicts that only a few major
players will be left in business by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they face stiff competition from suppliers _ that is,
airlines, hotels and car rental agencies with their own Internet
reservation services. In 1996, Jupiter estimated, 79 percent of
on-line travel bookings for leisure and small-business travelers
were completed through Expedia, Travelocity, Preview and the other
on-line agencies. In 1997 that dropped to 52 percent, said Jupiter
analyst Fiona S. Swerdlow in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sort of shift was going to happen anyway,'' she said,
``but it is still a healthy market, growing tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors know this is a distribution channel that is growing
and are willing to continue with their investments, but in the next
several years they will start to expect to see returns. That's when
the shakeout (will) occur,'' Swerdlow said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strategies at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Internet Travel
Network (www.itn.net), Swerdlow noted, is to not only provide
bookings for on-line consumers but also license that booking
technology to corporations. ``They're making sure they are not
locked into one segment,'' she said.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-line travel companies say business is brisk and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia, launched in October 1996, said its bookings increased
400 percent between January 1997 and January 1998. More than $5
million a week is booked in travel reservations on Expedia,
according to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Its Expedia Travel Network offers a myriad of products and
services, including cruises, vacation packages, rail fares and
schedules, and more than 20,000 bed-and-breakfast listings.
</P>
<P>
   Suzi LeVine, product manager of Expedia, speaks with authentic
Microsoft passion: ``On-line travel and what we have done with
Expedia is, to me, the best example of how the Internet becomes
real to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, owned by the Sabre Group, reached two milestones
last month: It had the on-line ticket industry's first $1 million
day and first $6 million week, the company said. It claims
Travelocity was the first on-line travel site to reach $3 million,
$4 million and $5 million in weekly sales. On-line travel providers
require registration, and Travelocity reports it has 3.5 million
registered members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue as a leader in Internet commerce, which
is projected to reach $41 billion in sales by 2002,'' said Terry
Jones, chief information officer of the Sabre Group, which launched
Travelocity in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like Travelocity and Expedia, Preview Travel, which introduced
reservations service on AOL in May 1996, found that partnering was
key to its success. Last week, Preview formed a marketing alliance
with MasterCard to increase electronic commerce. It is also the
primary travel service on America Online, Excite, Lycos, SNAP and
USAToday.com.
</P>
<P>
   Preview is doing between $4 million and $5 million in bookings a
week, Orton said.

`COLLECTED FICTIONS': SAVORING A BORGES BLEND OF IMAGININGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, publication notes are at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story ``Ibn-Hakam al-Bokhari, Murdered in His Labyrinth,''
roughly in the middle of this marvelous new collection of stories
by Jorge Luis Borges, is as good a place as any to start an
appreciation of one of the most remarkable writers of our century.
A king flees the ghost of his vizier, whom he has killed, taking
refuge in a labyrinth he builds on the moors of Cornwall. But the
ghost, or what seems to be a ghost, catches up with him, and the
king is murdered within his own hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   It is not one of Borges' greatest stories, but many of the
familiar elements of his work are here: arcane knowledge,
characters that emerge from some combination of mythology and
scholarship, images of labyrinths, a lightly satirical Homeric
tone, blood and vengeance, the blending of murder and metaphysics,
and an interplay of appearances and apparitions in which reality
and illusion are almost indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Only Borges created literature out of that mixture, though one
can guess at some of his diverse sources of inspiration: Edgar
Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Miguel de
Cervantes, with a liberal dusting of Omar Khayyam, the cabala and
Islamic theology, and a great deal of esoteric reading.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to an earlier collections that is wrapped
into this one, Borges writes about ``the madness'' of ``setting out
in 500 pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five
minutes.'' He spent his career (which ended with his death in 1986)
writing ``notes on imaginary books.'' This new collection of the
complete imaginings of the Argentine writer, freshly translated
from the Spanish by Andrew Hurley, is an event, and cause for
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Borges' work chronologically, as this collection is
arranged, is to be reminded of the strangeness of his art
(strangeness being, in the opinion of the literary critic Harold
Bloom, the main criterion for membership in the canon of great
writers). Borges was attracted to fantasy writing, as in his story
``The Aleph,'' but a very recherche fantasy writing grounded in
arcane lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aleph'' begins, like so many Borges stories, with what
seems an autobiographical digression, the death of Beatriz Viterbo,
friend with whom the narrator had been unrequitedly in love.
Beatriz had a cousin, Carlos Argentino Daneri, despised by Borges
(who, as in many of his stories, identifies himself as the
narrator) as a man whose ``oral expression was extravagant'' but
whose ``metrical clumsiness prevented him, except on a very few
occasions, from transmitting that extravagance to the poem.''
Inside Daneri's house, it turns out, is an aleph, a point in space
that contains all points, which he invites Borges to see. The
compressed personal and metaphysical themes of the story combine in
a work of mystical enchantment.
</P>
<P>
   The aleph that Borges sees is ``a small iridescent sphere of
almost unbearable brightness'' in which ``all the places of the
world, seen from every angle, coexist.'' Borges gazes upon
infinity, which, of course, is undescribable, and sees, among many
other things, a disturbing truth about Beatriz and Daneri, which is
why the hated cousin wanted him to look upon the aleph in the first
place. The story is really about love, deceit and, in the end, a
desperate effort by Borges to escape the moral consequences of what
he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aleph'' is a luminous work, and far from the only one in
this collection. This is not to say that all of Borges' stories
reach that level. The book reveals, in fact, that Borges reached
his peak in the 1940s with collections like ``The Garden of Forking
Paths'' and ``Artifices'' as well as ``The Aleph.'' The work of
later decades is tinged with a certain imitativeness of the earlier
stories, but even a reduced Borges is fascinating. Almost
everything he presents, from the heavily intellectual masterpieces
like ``Tloen, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'' to fragments like ``Toenails''
(a single-paragraph thought about mortality), is laden with
mystery, double meanings, ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tloen, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,'' perhaps the height of
philosophical playfulness as literature, Borges invents an orderly
alternative way of thinking and talking. He sets down the
principles of a language in which there are no nouns, only
``impersonal verbs, modified by monosyllabic suffixes (or prefixes)
functioning as adverbs.'' `` `The moon rose above the river' is
`hloer u fang axaxaxas mloe,' or, as Xul Solar succinctly
translates: Upward, behind the onstreaming it mooned.'' Marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   There is a a deeper meaning here, about the inherent tyranny of
totally ordered societies. (Borges is writing in response to the
rise of Nazism in Germany, with its Argentine echoes.) ``Contact
with Tloen, the HABIT of Tloen, has disintegrated this world.''
</P>
<P>
   How different from this learned exercise in political parable
are ``Death and the Compass'' and ``Emma Zunz,'' in which Borges
indulges one of his favorite pastimes, inventing perfect acts of
vengeance. Though linked by the high-impact elegance of Borges'
prose, these stories are a far cry from his other utopias, like
``The Lottery in Babylon,'' in which a state lottery presents an
organizing principle for all of life: that chance alone determines
individual fate.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are marvels like ``Pierre Menard, Author of the
Quixote,'' a mind-bending parody of a literary dispute, about a
writer whose greatest achievement was to recompose two chapters of
``Don Quixote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intellectual exercise that is not ultimately
pointless,'' Borges writes, a statement produced in full knowledge
that he is fashioning an intellectual exercise about an
intellectual exercise. It is a typically enigmatic touch from a
writer who endlessly teases himself and his readers.

POETIC JUSTICE FOR AN ARTIST RIDICULED BY THE NAZIS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Shortly before he left Germany for the United States in
1937, the artist Lyonel Feininger wrote to his son Lux: ``I feel 25
years younger now that I know I am going to a country where
imagination in art and abstraction are not considered an absolute
crime, as they are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Feininger, an American who led a German life, was not emigrating
but returning to his native country, driven from Germany by the
political and cultural intimidation that had arrived after Hitler
came to power in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Feininger left, the Nazis seized 378 of the works
that had made him one of the most famous artists in Germany,
singling out some of them for ridicule in an exhibition of
``degenerate art'' in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Germany has been celebrating Feininger as one of
its own, with retrospectives of his watercolors and sketches in
Hamburg and Tuebingen and, since July, a retrospective of 137 of
his 540 oil paintings at the Neue Nationalgalerie here.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 60,000 visitors have seen the exhibition, which
occupies most of the spacious basement of the gallery, a
glass-and-steel museum designed by Mies van der Rohe, who, like
Feininger, was a guiding spirit of the Bauhaus movement before the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Lyonel Feininger: From Gelmeroda to Manhattan,''
traces the artist's vision, from the inspiration he found in church
architecture in villages like Gelmeroda, in the Thuringian
countryside near Weimar, to his final years in his native New York
City, where he died in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   After closing on Oct. 11, the exhibition will reopen in Munich
on Nov. 1 in the Haus der Kunst, remaining until Jan. 24. There is
poetic justice in the setting: the building, designed for Hitler by
one of his favorite architects, Paul Ludwig Troost, is now devoted
to the kind of modern art the Nazis tried to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last big Feininger exhibition in Germany was held in the
Haus der Kunst in 1973,'' said Dr. Roland Maerz, the organizer of
this retrospective. ``He was never forgotten in Germany, but this
year, thanks to cooperation from private collections and museums in
Germany, elsewhere in Europe and the United States, we've been able
to put together the first show devoted exclusively to his
paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Maerz said he would have liked to have scheduled an American
stop for the exhibition but that ``some of the lenders didn't want
the paintings gone for such a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Berlin's biggest Feininger exhibition since 1931, when 137
of his oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors were exhibited in
the Crown Prince Palace, destroyed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the daily Berliner Morgenpost, Sofia Kannenberg said:
``The common thread that runs through the show is vision, depth of
feeling, introspection and yearning to find salvation in art.'' The
exhibition is testament to Feininger's success.
</P>
<P>
   Leonell Charles Feininger (he changed the spelling as an artist)
was born into a family of musicians in New York City in 1871. His
mother, Elizabeth Lutz Feininger, was a singer and pianist, and his
father, Karl (or Charles) Feininger, was a classical violinist
whose own father had fled Germany for the American South after the
failure of the 1848 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Leo, as he was called, was steered by his parents toward a
career in music, which played an important role in his art. He was
an accomplished violinist, could play the 48 preludes and fugues in
Bach's ``Well-Tempered Clavier'' on the harmonium and harpsichord
and composed 13 fugues of his own for piano and organ.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring architecture of Bach's ``Art of the Fugue'' inspired
some of his rigorously structured paintings. On Sept. 19, the
pianist Vivian Goergen will play fugues by Bach, Karl Richter and
Feininger in the exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
   Feininger's parents wanted him to study music in Germany, but in
1887 he persuaded them to let him go there to study painting
instead. He stayed, married and established a reputation as an
artist, though at first mainly as a caricaturist. In 1906 he signed
a contract with The Chicago Tribune to produce two cartoon series,
the ``Kin-der-Kids'' and ``Wee Willie Winkie's World.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune wanted him to move to Chicago, but by then he had
met Julia Lilienfeld Berg, a painter who widened his artistic
horizons and changed his life. Both divorced to marry each other
and remained in Germany. The Tribune terminated Feininger's
contract, and he produced his first oil paintings in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition begins with an overview of his work and then
proceeds chronologically. Art by other painters who inspired him,
like Cubist works of Picasso, Braque and Robert Delaunay in Paris
or, more speculatively, the 19th-century German Romantic painter
Caspar David Friedrich, are salted strategically among Feininger's
canvases to make their points.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive hat-like steeple of the medieval village church
of Gelmeroda is a recurring motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``My `cubism' (again wrongly so called) I would rather call, if
it must have a name, `Prisma-ismus,''' he wrote in 1913 to a
childhood friend, the American painter Alfred Vance Churchill. Some
of the church paintings as well as works like ``The Bird Cloud,''
lent by the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard, indeed have a
prismatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   The rich 380-page catalog includes an essay titled ``Lyonel
Feininger in Germany'' by one of his surviving sons, Lux, an artist
in Cambridge, Mass., and pictures by another, the photographer
Andreas Feininger, that document their father's links to the
Bauhaus movement. That association started with an early invitation
to Weimar from Walter Gropius in 1919 and continued until the
Nazi-dominated city council in Dessau dissolved the Bauhaus there
in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, two years before the Nuremberg race laws were enacted,
the Nationalgalerie asked Feininger to prove his Aryan background
going back two generations and beyond, which soon became a
prerequisite for permission to work in Germany as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Although his forebears were German Swabian Catholics, he was, he
told friends, increasingly referred to as ``the Jew Feininger.''
His wife was partly of Jewish ancestry, and the couple soon
realized that their days in Germany were numbered. Feininger
accepted a teaching invitation from Mills College in California in
1936, and the couple left Germany for good on June 10, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it will be said of me that at age 65 I entered New
York Harbor with two whole dollars in my pocket,'' Feininger
recalled of his arrival. He was virtually unknown in the United
States, although that would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled at first by the skyscrapers that had sprung up in New
York during his 50-year absence, he produced his distinctive
visions of them, while still trying to summon Germany back from
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Lines that had been clear and prismatic became blurred, and his
pastel colors darkened, for example in ``Shadow of Dissolution,'' a
1953 painting toward the exhibition's close that anticipates his
death three years later.
</P>
<P>
   But other works seem to close a circle that began with the
Gelmeroda paintings. ``Manhattan, Night,'' a 1940 canvas, bears a
startling resemblance to ``Stars Above the Town,'' started 20 years
earlier. The stars, like fiery crosses, that illuminated the German
town now transfigure the New York nightscape, completing a vision
for which the artist is revered in both his countries.

BI-PARTISAN POLL PAINTS GRIM PICTURE FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bi-partisan poll released Tuesday shows President
Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter is taking its toll
on Democratic electoral prospects this November.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents to the ``Battleground '98'' survey conducted jointly
by Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat,
said they favored GOP congressional candidates 43 percent to 40
percent. Among those who say they are very likely to vote, the
margin widened, to 45 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar poll by Goeas and Lake last December found voters in a
dead heat, with 40 percent in favor of each party.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also contrasts to a poll late last month after
Clinton's Aug. 17 speech in which he acknowledged not telling the
truth for seven months about a sexual relationship with ex-White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. In that poll, issued by the Pew
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press, 61 percent of
respondents said Clinton's admission will not affect how they vote
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Goeas and Lake poll Tuesday measured the responses of 1,000
registered voters nationwide and was conducted Aug. 23-25. Although
it avoided specific questions about Clinton's behavior with
Lewinsky, Goeas and Lake said the Lewinsky matter was behind the
unmistakable erosion of support for Clinton and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are disenchanted, let down,'' Goeas, president of
The Tarrance Group in Alexandria, Va., told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, president of Washington-based Lake Snell Perry &AMP;
Associates, agreed. ``If the election were held today, it would be
bad for Democrats,'' she said. ``I'm worried, but I get paid to be
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Respondents most enthusiastic about voting this November tended
to be Republican while those caring less were more likely to be
Democratic, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of ``moral values'' rocketed to the top of the list of
problems facing the nation, according to the poll. Fourteen percent
of respondents identified moral and religious issues as the most
serious, equal with crime and drugs. That's 10 points higher than
in the previous Goeas-Lake poll.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent said restoring moral values should be a top
congressional priority. Forty-two percent said Republicans better
represented their values while 35 percent preferred Democrats.
That's an eight-point gain for Republicans since January.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously for Democrats, support among women was a very narrow 4
percent. Women, a key Democratic constituency, preferred Democrats
to Republicans by 43 percent to 39 percent. The poll showed the
balance was tipped heavily by minority-group women, who favor
Democrats over Republicans by 56 percentage points, 74 percent to
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were ahead among several subgroups of women, the
poll showed. White working women, for instance, favored Republicans
by 2 percentage points. Among white women who stay home, the GOP
margin was 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal standing among voters has plummeted, the poll
found. Last December, the two pollsters reported Clinton's personal
approval at 45 percent, with disapproval at 43 percent _ a 2
percent difference in Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest survey, 26 percent of respondents approved of
Clinton and 62 percent disapproved _ a 36-point gap against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas predicted a 15-to-20 seat gain for Republicans in the
House and a four-to-six seat gain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have controlled both chambers since the 1994
election and now have a five-seat margin in the Senate and an
11-seat margin in the House. On Election Day, Nov. 3, all 435 House
seats and 34 Senate seats are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   For now, momentum is with the GOP, Goeas said. ``If you control
the football, you score,'' he said. ``If you don't, you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that while the situation is increasingly grim for
Democrats and Clinton, both have cards they can still play.
Clinton, especially when accompanied by First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, continues to be a prime player in raising money and
motivating the Democratic voting base.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic fortunes this November depend on how successful the
party is in framing the debate around such issues as regulating
managed care health plans, preserving Social Security, and
improving public education, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats need to take this poll as a wake-up call,'' she
said. ``They need to devote more resources to energizing the
base.''
</P>
<P>
   A continued focus on the Lewinsky matter could create a backlash
that favors Democrats, she said, adding: ``If the (Democratic)
agenda continues to be drowned out for seven weeks, voters will be
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   After the poll's release, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman
of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a
statement: ``We have always anticipated that 1998 would be a
low-turnout year, and we are prepared to perform well in that
setting.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scattered, intermittent showers and a few thundershowers, some
with small hail, will develop over the interior Northeast as a
cold, upper-level low- pressure system forges slowly east over the
region. Many places will start with partial sunshine in the
morning, but, as air in contact with the warming ground rises into
the lofty cold pool later in the morning and afternoon, billowy
cumulus clouds will burgeon, setting the stage for chilly showers
and thundershowers. Temperatures in the 40s are possible while
showers occur in the mountains. Thus, the tenor of the day over the
interior Northeast will be unsettled and cool, with variable clouds
and sporadic showers. Showers will weaken as they move east toward
the Northeast seaboard, but a few may survive to affect coastal
areas, particularly the northeast New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will escort a
front across northern Florida. Farther west, a moisture-laden
tropical disturbance will bring the risk of heavy rains to parts of
the Texas and Louisiana seaboards.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will develop in Montana and Wyoming as a
cool front slices slowly eastward across the northern Rockies.
Widely separated storms will also flare from the Sierra Nevada of
California to the southern Rockies as the uneven heating of
mountains and valleys promotes rising currents of air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a rapid warm-up will commence in the western high
Plains as air descending the Rockies into the western Dakotas and
western Nebraska is heated by compression.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wind Damage
</P>
<P>
   An armada of severe thunderstorms raced east across upstate New
York for two hours starting just before midnight on Monday,
inflicting wind damage in a swath nearly 100 miles long and five to
10 miles wide. Maximum gusts were estimated at 100 miles an hour.
Such a long-lived, organized system of gusty thunderstorms is
called a derecho. In the rear of the arc of storms that outline a
derecho, a stream of very fast winds, called a rear inflow jet,
develops and descends from high altitudes into the storms, arming
them with dangerous and damaging gusts.

ANALYSIS: HONESTY CAN BE TRICKY, THE LOOT-HOLDERS LEARN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the last six months, there has been a notable
change in the art world. It has nothing to do with exhibitions or
acquisitions, but rather with the rhetoric surrounding potential
claims for art plundered during World War II that later found its
way, by various routes through dealers and collectors, into
American museums.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid the kind of outcry that enveloped Swiss banks
that dragged their feet before compensating Jews who lost assets
during the war, museums are no longer denying that there might be
problems in their galleries. They are now pledging to resolve
claims quickly, if they arise, using mediation if necessary. And
they are reviewing their collections to identify artworks tainted
by Nazi looting.
</P>
<P>
   But righting the wrongs of history is never easy. And as a
closely watched case in Seattle is demonstrating, returning a
looted painting or providing compensation for its loss can be
tricky and drawn out _ far more so than the return of bank
accounts, gold or insurance payments lost or stolen during the war.
</P>
<P>
   With those assets, large-scale settlements from big companies
are possible. With art, the cases are individual. No one knows how
many potential cases involve American museums. If the handful that
have occurred are any indication, they often pop up unexpectedly
when a family, sometimes after years of looking, locates a lost
work in a catalog or exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, the party or parties who stole the
artwork half a century ago and who profited from trading it are
often long gone, while the current owner of a stolen painting, be
it a museum or an individual, probably had nothing to do with the
theft. The idea of a ``universal solution'' involving a pool of
money that would be used to pay claimants, like the one that Swiss
banks recently agreed to establish, seems attractive theoretically.
But it runs into problems because there is no comparable single
source of money for an art fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle case involves the heirs of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish
art dealer who fled Paris for New York to escape the Nazi invasion,
leaving his collection in a bank vault. Last fall his heirs found
``Odalisque,'' a Matisse painting that had been taken from him by
the Nazis, in the Seattle Art Museum, which had been given the work
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, after negotiations to recover the painting failed,
the Rosenbergs took the museum to court. In refusing to give back
the picture, the museum hinted that it wanted to force a
comprehensive solution involving the Manhattan dealer, Knoedler &AMP;
Co., which brought ``Odalisque'' to the United States. So, late
last month, the museum sued Knoedler, which had bought the painting
in 1954 from a Paris dealer, now defunct, and sold it a few months
later to Virginia and Prentice Bloedel, both now dead, who donated
it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The museum says that Knoedler committed fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and breach of warranty of title when it sold the
work to the Bloedels. If the museum has to give up the painting, it
wants compensation for its market value, which may be $2 million or
more, even though it did not pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Knoedler, which has not yet responded formally, said through its
lawyer that it had nothing to do with the museum dispute because
its dealings were all with the Bloedels, not the museum. ``I don't
know of any case where a museum has gone to someone who never dealt
with them and tried to extract money from them,'' said Lewis B.
Clayton of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison in Manhattan.
``The only people who could press a claim are the Bloedels.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, said its lawyer, John A. Reed of Davis Wright &AMP;
Tremaine in Seattle, has standing in the suit as the Bloedels'
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling is striking because the Rosenberg case is
relatively straightforward and well documented. Among the many
papers supporting the Rosenberg claim are two exhibition catalogs
from 1937 and 1938 recording the painting as the property of Paul
Rosenberg and an official catalog of looted art published by the
French government in 1947 listing him as the owner. The painting's
whereabouts between 1941 and 1954 are unknown, but Rosenberg and
his family searched constantly for ``Odalisque'' and the many other
paintings looted from his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Facing those facts, which the museum says are supported by its
own research into the painting's provenance, the museum does not
deny the Rosenbergs' claim. ``More likely than not, the Rosenbergs
have superior title,'' Reed said. But the museum refuses to return
the painting until it completes its provenance research and, more
important, presses its claim against Knoedler.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's research does suggest potential problems for
Knoedler. For example, its suit against the dealer asserts that a
Knoedler employee told Mrs. Bloedel in 1954 that Matisse, not
Rosenberg, owned the paintings for the 1937 and '38 exhibitions
even though Knoedler had the exhibition catalogs in its possession
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The museum said it wanted a court to determine the painting's
ownership because it felt that returning the painting voluntarily
might weaken its case against Knoedler. Without a court ruling,
Reed said, ``Knoedler might look at the same information we have
and say you made a mistake when you gave it back voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way, at least, the Seattle museum is fortunate: it has a
gallery to sue. Knoedler celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1996,
although it is no longer a family business. (Armand Hammer, the
late financier, bought the company in 1971 and it is now controlled
by his foundation).
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a heck of a lot of galleries are left that did business''
shortly after the war, particularly in European art, said Richard
Gray, the president of the Art Dealers Association of America. The
dealers' organization, whose members are eager to avoid
debilitating legal costs, recently endorsed a policy urging
third-party mediation of wartime art disputes, following the same
recommendation issued in June by the Association of Art Museum
Directors.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has any idea of how to resolve a case fairly when the
culpable party is no longer in business or alive, and when making
things right for one victim creates another.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the idea of establishing a fund to meet such claims
is being floated by a few art experts and Jewish organizations.
Lacking a credible source of money, however, it is an orphan idea.
When the idea of levying a tax on dealers and auction houses, or
their transactions, has come up at symposiums and conferences, it
has not won resounding support from the art trade, with few people
in the business feeling a responsibility for what happened in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the most viable suggestion seems to be voluntary
contributions. ``It might be in the interest of the art community _
auction houses, dealers, museums _ to contribute to the solution,''
said Ori Soltes, who recently stepped down as director of the B'nai
B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington. They could
justify ``communal reasons'' for their participation, he argues,
perhaps the way industry groups sometimes pay into a fund to settle
class-action claims.

RECHARGED FOR FALL: IN FRANCE, THEY CALL IT LA RENTREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (for release Sunday, Sept. 13)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the wonderfully strict cycles of life that make the
French seem so predictable, la rentree first announces itself each
year as a reason to postpone things.
</P>
<P>
   From early July, there is little that cannot await the return _
la rentree _ to Paris in September. But, take note, this is not a
symptom of laziness. It is simply part of the French order of
things. Parisians hold parties to say goodbye for the summer in the
knowledge that social, cultural, political and business life will
resume with a vengeance a la rentree.
</P>
<P>
   So now, once again, Parisians are back, hurriedly recovering
control of their city from tourists, adding frowns of impatience to
still-bronzed faces, crowding restaurants that felt no need to stay
open in August to serve foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In every sense, a new season has arrived _ and all of it
meticulously linked to la rentree. The school year has begun (la
rentree scolaire), government and opposition are again squabbling
(la rentree politique), businessmen are back at their desks (la
rentree economique), new art exhibitions and stage productions are
opening (la rentree culturelle) and hundreds of new books are out
(la rentree litteraire).
</P>
<P>
   True, it could be argued that this phenomenon is no longer
exclusive to Paris or even France. Since most inhabitants of Rome,
Madrid, Amsterdam, Munich, London and beyond now also do major
disappearing acts from their cities in the summer, they too return
en masse. And while New Yorkers may still exhibit a touching
mixture of envy and disapproval of Europe's long vacations, ``after
Labor Day'' has taken on a good number of the attributes of ``apres
la rentree.'' Yet Paris remains the benchmark because this is where
it all began.
</P>
<P>
   What began?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there would be no great rentree without a great depart.
And it is this programmed exodus that the French claim as their own
invention. It began in the 1930s with the introduction of the first
guaranteed paid holidays for workers, and by the 1950s ``dead
August'' had become a celebration of the French art de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Amusingly, when Germans, Britons, Dutch and other northern
Europeans first decided to imitate the French, they too did it a la
francaise, traipsing to the beaches of the Cote d'Azur or wining
and dining in the bucolic villages of Provence. Today, they also
crowd hilltops and resorts in Italy, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Britain appears to be the latest country to institutionalize
``dead August,'' thanks, it seems, to Prime Minister Tony Blair,
who more or less took the phone off the hook at 10 Downing Street
and spent the entire month in Italy and France (although he was
forced return home briefly after the bombing in Omagh, Northern
Ireland, on Aug. 15).
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, he was merely following in the footsteps of
Britain's well-heeled and chattering classes. But London was
emptier than ever. Last month, with his traditional clientele away,
Sir Terence Conran, the design mogul, was offering $16 fixed-menu
lunches or dinners at five of his glitzy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It was even possible to get a table without name-dropping at the
Riverside Cafe and the Pharmacy, two of London's most fashionable
eateries. So now even London is creating the conditions for une
rentree.
</P>
<P>
   The world of culture, though, does not rest. Visitors to Paris
still want to visit the Louvre. American tourists in London still
consider West End theaters to be one of the city's main appeals.
Indeed, three musicals _ ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' ``Dr.
Dolittle'' and ``Oklahoma!'' _ opened in London in July.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, as residents of major European cities
disperse, artists and performers now increasingly accompany them
thanks to the staggering number of music, theater and other
festivals that have grown up in recent years. Salzburg, Bayreuth,
Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Edinburgh and Glyndebourne may still have
the best known festivals, but the arts are now well entrenched as a
tourist attraction throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   London's cultural rentree can in fact be tagged apres Edinburgh.
``Cultural life in Britain is like water in a bath,'' Robert
Hewison, a British cultural historian, explained. ``The water is
usually in London. Then, for three weeks in August and early
September, it all rushes to Edinburgh for television, film, theater
and music festivals. There's no point in opening anything in London
in August. Only the Promenade concerts at the Albert Hall keep
going. But theater life is planned entirely around the autumn
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring and summer in Europe and the United States are, of
course, fall and winter in the Southern Hemisphere, which means
that cultural seasons are also upside-down. For instance, the
season at the Teatro Colon, the legendary opera house in Buenos
Aires, runs from April through December, when seemingly the entire
city moves in a French-like depart to the beach at Punta del Este
in neighboring Uruguay. This calendar has its advantages: when
Europe's opera houses are closed, the Colon can draw big names
(Placido Domingo and Mirella Freni sang Giordano's ``Fedora'' there
last month).
</P>
<P>
   In countries where the weather is warm year-round and neither
depart nor rentree is called for, there is often no cultural season
worth mentioning. Could it be that culture was invented by
Europeans in order to get through the winter? Could it be that
winter resorts were invented to enable them to escape cultural
overdose? Still, as surely as colder weather is approaching, the
Northern Hemisphere's cultural program is going into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Paris jump-starts the season faster than some. In Milan, for
instance, the opera season at La Scala traditionally opens early in
December, while the Royal Shakespeare Company only starts its
London season at the Barbican Center in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in Paris, from the Comedie Francaise to the Paris Opera,
from the Musee d'Orsay to the Folies Bergere, cultural life is now
already stirring. And through early December, a fall festival, the
Festival d'Automne a Paris, is presenting productions and
performers from around the world, with China providing this year's
central theme.
</P>
<P>
   As the days grow shorter, much the same thing is happening in
all the major cities of the Northern Hemisphere, from Vienna to
Chicago. New York's version of the fall festival in Paris, for
example, is the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, a sort of bidding war breaks out as new plays,
movies, dance and opera productions, art exhibitions and books
compete for people's time and attention. Suddenly everything has to
be squeezed in _ school life, business life, social life and
cultural life. The rush of energy is tangible.

 PARIS: is tangible.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet in Paris, perhaps because the French invented the concept,
la rentree is an event unto itself. Marking the end of the biggest
disruption of normal life each year, it means that le tout Paris is
now back in town, that phones are answered, dinner invitations
accepted, gossip avidly exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   It is as important to have a good rentree as a good vacation. In
true Cartesian fashion, it is there to be measured and judged. And
this includes the quality of la rentree culturelle. What new movies
have you seen? Have you caught the show at the Musee d'Orsay?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would think of publishing a new book here in July or
August,'' said Susanna Lea, an editor at Editions Robert
Laffont/Fixot. ``Then a tidal wave comes in September, linked to
the year-end literary prizes, like the Goncourt. People ask each
other, `What did you read of la rentree?' La rentree litteraire is
critical, above all for fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, of course, it is too early to gauge the quality
of this year's rentree, at least in the arts. But la rentree
mentale, the crucial behavioral adjustment that takes place at this
time every year, has already happened.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, perhaps no more than in London, Berlin and New York,
there is a new buzz in the air, a quickening of step, an eagerness
to make a fresh start. So what's special about la rentree? Well, as
ever, the French have found le mot juste to describe it.

 TV NOTES: PRIME-TIME McGWIRE; NEW `ROSEANNE'; `SQUIGGLEVISION'  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clobbering Prime Time
</P>
<P>
   Besides knocking away at baseball's most magical record, Roger
Maris' 61 home runs in a season, Mark McGwire managed to wreak
havoc this week on the Fox network's plans to start up a couple of
its most crucial programs in the fall television season.
</P>
<P>
   But for Fox Broadcasting chairman David Hill, the decision was
easy because of the priority all the networks put now on bringing
national events to the public to meet increasing competition from
cable television and other sources. ``Network television has become
all about event-izing programming,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spent months and millions of dollars promoting the shift of
its animated comedy hit ``King of the Hill'' to Tuesday, and spent
more months and more millions promoting ``Costello,'' the new
sitcom to follow it.
</P>
<P>
   All that planning was wiped out with one McGwire swing Monday,
his No. 61, setting in motion Fox's contingency plan to pre-empt
its prime-time programming last night for McGwire's assault on No.
62.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, ``King of the Hill,'' despite the carefully planned
buildup to an episode tying up the cliffhanger that ended last
season (who will be killed in the propane explosion at the
Mega-Lo-Mart?); goodbye, ``Costello,'' although the new show was
reviewed in Tuesday's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill emphasized: ``The future of network television has to
be about bringing events of shared community involvement to the
public. What is everyone in the country talking about? What was on
the front page of every newspaper? McGwire and his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the man in charge of Fox's prime-time schedule, Peter
Roth, was ``100 percent behind the decision'' and pointed to what
every network is doing this fall. ``Look at what NBC is doing with
the Emmy Awards,'' he said. ``They added an hour to the telecast to
make it more of an event.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited the way CBS made an event out of the National
Football League's return to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the focus on ``King of the Hill'' and
``Costello,'' the decision did represent the worst-case scenario
for Fox's planning, Hill said. Weeks ago, he said, the Fox research
department had predicted that McGwire would be close to the record
starting this week.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Fox, which has a contract with major league
baseball for Sunday games on its network and weekday games on its
Fox Sports Channel and F/X cable channels, announced it would
broadcast McGwire's games on the network starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But when his home-run pace picked up, Fox was forced to change
its plans. It became a race of sorts with ESPN, the cable network
with the other national contract. ESPN had Monday's record-tying
game. Fox grabbed Tuesday night, with ESPN lined up for Wednesday
night. Fox would come back Thursday only if McGwire failed to
connect again by then.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Hill said, the record-breaking home run was all Fox
was interested in. ``If he was still at 60 after Monday we would
have kept `King of the Hill' on and left the game on F/X,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What of ``King of the Hill'' and ``Costello''? Both will begin
their season next week, after a torrent of promotion during last
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably cost us money,'' Hill said, referring to the
expense of the promotion. ``One never knows what the effect will
be. Trust me, if it's a disaster, I'll have enough people telling
me about it. Someone will come up and say `King of the Hill' didn't
work because we put it on when Jupiter was in the house of Alpha
Centauri.''

</P>
<P>
   A Carnival? No Way.
</P>
<P>
   A haze of mystery has settled around ``The Roseanne Show,''
which arrives Monday as the latest entry in the daytime television
gabfest listings. No one, not even the star herself, has been able
to say exactly what format her new show will follow _ foggery that
is intended to generate curiosity about the show, no doubt, but
that also arose from necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not have a rigid format,'' her producer, Eddie
October, has said, calling it part comedy and part talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a carnival act,'' said Roseanne, adding that it would
serve as ``a beacon of information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she will do serious, family-related segments,'' said Andy
Friendly, president of first-run syndication for King World, which
produces the show and has sold it to more than 150 stations around
the country. (In New York, it will be on Channel 4 weekdays at 3
p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   He cited Rosanne's already-taped profile of an organization
called Children of the Night, which helps runaway teen-agers, a
segment that includes interviews with some of the children on her
set. And Dennis Rodman, a guest in the first week, will have a
surprise reunion with the family of a Texas man dragged to death by
a truck, whose funeral expenses Rodman paid.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes segments will mix the serious with the funny, Friendly
said, as in an installment tentatively titled ``Fatapalooza,'' a
spoof on the rock-and-roll tour called ``Lollapaplooza'' in which
fat women will talk about their problems finding attractive
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list for the first week's shows includes Whoopi
Goldberg; the star of ``Hollywood Squares,'' another new King World
daytime show that also starts on Monday, and Debbie Reynolds. Nora
Dunn, the former ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian, will play a
regular ``character'' on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the eclectic format,'' Friendly said. ``It's
unpredictable. It really boils down to one word: Roseanne.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By LAWRIE MIFFLIN
</P>
<P>
   It's Got Squiggle Appeal  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could be the greatest television show on earth, but
apparently having the word science in its title made children avoid
it like, well, science. That's what the programmers at ABC decided
about the zany but also educational show ``Science Court,'' which
is about to start its second season on ABC's top-rated Saturday
morning cartoon lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Tom Snyder, the animation artist for ``Dr. Katz,
Professional Therapist,'' the children's show is drawn in the same
style, too, called Squigglevision, a term Snyder has trademarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science Court'' won praise from educators and parents, and
children liked it in focus groups, but its Nielsen ratings were
poor. ``We wanted to put out the biggest welcome mat possible to
kids this season,'' said Jonathan Barzilay, ABC's senior vice
president for children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   So ABC made two major changes. A math segment (``See You Later
Estimator'') and a vocabulary game have been added to the science
``cases'' argued in court before Judge Stone (with the voice of
comedian Paula Poundstone). And, ABC changed the show's name. The
new title: ``Squigglevision.''

ON FILM, CHILE CONFRONTS ITS OWN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (eds: production notes are at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-five years ago this week, on Sept. 11, 1973,
the democratically elected Marxist president of Chile, Salvador
Allende Gossens, died during a military coup as planes of the
Chilean air force bombed La Moneda, the presidential palace in
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was rule by a repressive military junta led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, which lasted until the election of a
civilian president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Allende's death is recalled in a poignant and
thought-provoking double bill opening at the Film Forum. The first
portion is ``The Coup d'Etat,'' the 91-minute central section of
``The Battle of Chile,'' Patricio Guzman's remarkable record of the
Marxist period, a documentary first seen in New York in its
191-minute entirety in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The second portion is the 58-minute ``Chile: Obstinate Memory,''
the 1997 film that Guzman compiled when he returned to his homeland
to seek out survivors among Allende's supporters and to show ``The
Battle of Chile'' for the first time to members of a generation
born in the intervening years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the program provide a striking portrait of the
fervor of revolution and despair surrounding its death, it also
raises disturbing questions about the impact of historic events on
those who live in their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Some among the young weep at the repression of popular will and
the ``disappearances'' of so many of the supporters of the Allende
regime. Others look about at the stability and prosperity of Chile
and their own untroubled lives and see good in the coup, arguing
that it anticipated and bypassed a far more destructive civil war
between Chile's haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those partisans of the revolution who lived
through it and now recall their dead comrades and deal as best they
can with their memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanting to forget is self-defense,'' says Allende's widow,
Hortensia Bussi. ``I want to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the context of the longer version of ``The Battle
of Chile,'' Guzman's ``Coup d'Etat'' is freighted with tragic
inevitability as its cameras _ some operated by cinematographers
who died in the making, others who vanished forever in the junta's
prisons _ track the few months from late June 1973, when an initial
coup attempt failed, till Allende's overthrow and death.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashedly pro-revolutionary, the cameras seem to be everywhere
among the workers and marchers who put Allende in office with a
third of the national vote. At the same time, Guzman's film makes
it clear that while the workers may control many of the factories,
Allende cannot muster the support in the Chilean legislature to
carry out a Marxist program. And it leaves no doubt where the
sympathies of most in the armed forces lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile: Obstinate Memory'' would be a moving document even if
it had confined itself solely to those who supported and survived
the revolution. But by turning to members of a new generation, it
poses the most profoundly troubling of historical questions: Did
those who died die in vain?
</P>

   Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is announcing $8.1 million in
grants to the arts Wednesday, including $3.5 million to support
construction of a 10-story complex of the New 42nd Street Inc.,
where theater and dance artists can create, rehearse, perform and
teach. The 199-seat theater in the building, between Seventh and
Eighth Avenues, will be named Duke on 42nd Street. In addition, $2
million will go to the National Dance Project of the New England
Foundation for the Arts for the creation of new work and for its
tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis is to receive $1.5
million, including $500,000 to commission work by contemporary jazz
artists; the remaining $1 million is to be matched by the Walker to
establish an endowment for future music and dance projects. And
$1.1 million will go the the National Performance Network, a
grass-roots organization in 40 communities nationwide, for new
work, some 200 one-week residencies, annual meetings and to
underwrite plans to strengthen the network.

   Not content with writing plays like ``The Judas Kiss,''
``Skylight'' and ``Plenty,'' David Hare, 50, decided to make his
debut on the other side of the footlights. Tuesday night, at the
Duke of York's Theater in London, was opening night for the Royal
Court Theater production of Hare's one-man play, ``Via Dolorosa.''
It is a meditation on Israel and Palestine inspired by a recent
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Stormy Ending
</P>
<P>
   Wearing plastic raincoats over evening clothes, more than 2,000
spectators fled the outdoor theater in Beijing's Forbidden City on
Monday night when hailstones and rain pelted a lavish staging of
Puccini's ``Turandot.'' Many in the audience had flown from Europe
and Asia to see the $15 million production, directed by the
filmmaker Zhang Yimou and conducted by Zubin Mehta. Tickets cost as
much as $1,000. No refunds were available when the performance, one
of a scheduled eight, was halted.

   NEW YORK _ Commemorating Israel's 50th anniversary, the Jewish
Museum in Manhattan will open an exhibition of new Israeli art on
Sunday. The 72 works on display through Jan. 3 include paintings,
photography, performance art and video by 35 artists including Ido
Bar-El, Barry Frydlender, Gideon Gechtman, Moshe Gershuni, Israel
Hershberg, Moshe Kupferman, Lea Nikel and Uri Tzaig.
</P>
<P>
   Running through the works are themes of tension, conflict and
personal concerns. The title of the exhibition, ``After Rabin: New
Art From Israel,'' refers to the show's primary focus: the work of
established and emerging artists created in the three years since
the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

 &HT;    HISTORIC BASEBALL WILL BE SAFE FROM TAXES, IRS RULES
 &HT;    300&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (s) sports categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fortunate fan who comes up with the ball that
breaks baseball's home run record _ and quickly gives it back to
the herculean hitter _ won't have to pay a fortune in gift taxes
for his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing an earlier call by a subordinate, the top umpire at
Internal Revenue Service ruled Tuesday that the government will
give any fan who catches the historic blast from Mark McGwire or
Sammy Sosa a free pass.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, he or she would be treated the same as any ordinary
taxpayer who immediately declines a valuable prize or returns
unsolicited goods to the sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes pieces of the tax code can be as hard to understand
as the infield fly rule,'' IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti
said after his agency was deluged by complaints from Capitol Hill
over an earlier interpretation of the tax law.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that the fan who gives back the home run ball
deserves a round of applause, not a big tax bill,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman had told reporters that any fan who gives back
a valuable ball to McGwire or Sosa could owe gift taxes equal to
nearly 40 percent of the ball's value. Already, a $1 million offer
has been made for the historic horsehide.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti's reading mollified Senate Finance Chairman William
Roth Jr., R-Del., who has spoken with the IRS chief earlier in the
day and urged him to speedily resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was ever even a possibility of Mark
McGwire's historic 62nd home run ball being taxed is a prime
example of what's wrong with our current tax code,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tax laws are replete with provisions that defy common
sense and are patently unfair,'' the senator added. ``I hope this
event can spur us on to consensus on reforming the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gift taxes are owed by the giver _ not the receiver _ of a gift
worth more than $10,000. A lifetime $625,000 exclusion could be
applied, but then the fan would not be able to shield his or her
estate or any future gifts from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Having the multimillionaire slugger pay the gift tax wouldn't
have saved the day, either, because the payment would then have
been treated as income to the fan.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``may be different if the fan decided to sell the
ball,'' Rossotti warned. Then, ordinary federal and state income
taxes would come into play.
</P>
<P>
   If the ball were sold quickly for $1 million, the new owner of a
baseball ordinarily valued at $9 would become liable for about
$396,000 in federal levies. But if he kept the ball for at least 12
months and then sold it for the same $1 million sum, the
transaction would be treated as a long-term capital gain and
subject to a maximum tax of $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rossotti's ruling, it's not clear if the fan decides to
keep the ball, and it then winds up in an estate, whether he or she
would become liable for death taxes on its residual value.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that a fan's decision to give the ball to
a charity would nullify tax liabilities. The charity that benefits
from the gift would be free to sell the ball and the resulting
income also would be tax-free.

PINK RIBBON DISEASE CAN ALSO HIT MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Sept. 15)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one week I had lunch with an old friend who told me she's
recovering from breast cancer, heard from two friends that their
mammograms were questionable, and started to hug a woman who winced
and backed off, explaining she'd just had a lumpectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Women are getting accustomed to breast cancer to a degree we
wish we didn't have to, but in an open and active way that makes it
easier for us to talk and worry about it and nag each other to do
self exams and get check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't have an exclusive on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Carl's mother had breast cancer. Carl's maternal grandmother had
breast cancer. ``My mother didn't have a daughter to pass it on to,
so she gave it to me,'' says Carl with a crooked smile.
</P>
<P>
   Carl, who lives in Northern California and does fine book
printing, is not his real name. But a man with a breast cancer is
wary about going public.
</P>
<P>
   Carl feels as segregated as women with breast cancer once were.
He's embarrassed. ``If you have breast cancer and you're a man
people look at you strange and seem to question your sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Most women have stopped being shy about breast cancer. The
boldest ones walk around without wigs or hats, forego a prosthesis,
even bare the badge of their mastectomy. Others are low profile but
meet in support groups, run races to raise money for breast cancer
research and talk openly of their illness.
</P>
<P>
   Few feel the need anymore to hide and keep it a secret, like it
made them any less of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with men. Breast cancer doesn't fit the
male image. Women have breasts; men have chests. When middle-aged
women start worrying about breast cancer, their men's fears go more
to heart attacks and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is not on a man's list of major health worries.
Rightfully so. Breast cancer happens 100 more times to women than
men, but it does happen and 300 men die from it each year. When
tumors develop they are not caught early mostly because men don't
go for routine breast x-rays and don't think to check themselves
for lumps. Yet, breast cancer acts the same way in men as it does
in women, is diagnosed and treated the same, and has as many
unknowns as to what causes it.
</P>
<P>
   Carl felt something suspicious while showering.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't as much a lump as what he calls ``a certain
non-symmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed it on a Saturday and I worried all day Sunday and
went to the clinic on Monday.'' Carl had a mammogram and a week
later, surgery to remove the lump and some lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates that this year 1,600 new
cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in American men.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor told Carl he knew of only three other men with breast
cancer. His surgeon, only one.
</P>
<P>
   Carl was fairly clueless, himself. ``I didn't know men could get
breast cancer. But it didn't seem like it could be anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl is 62. His wife died of pelvic cancer in her late 40s.
Carl's mother had a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation
treatments and then lived another 30 years until age 89.
</P>
<P>
   So, cancer was not completely alien to Carl, but in dealing with
breast cancer he felt pretty much alone.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons breast cancer support is decidedly more
female than male based. Mammogram clinics are more apt to have
``Good Housekeeping'' magazines than ``Field and Stream.'' The
advocacy symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the breast cancer booklets they gave me were written for
women,'' says Carl. ``That shouldn't make any different because it
works the same way with both of us. But it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that literature for women naturally deals with the
emotional affect of losing a breast. For a man, Carl points out,
``The cosmetological issue isn't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he did mind the loss of his hair after chemotherapy, along
with the beard that he had for 30 years. ``That bothered me more
than I thought it would. Nobody recognized me.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst, however, were the anxiety attacks that followed
chemotherapy, which his doctors didn't warn him about. He described
the attacks as ``feeling threatened by all kinds of nameless
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He's now on an anti-anxiety drug. His hair and beard are back
--thick, curly and more black than gray. ``My oncologist joked,
``Who needs Rogaine?'''
</P>
<P>
   But he still keeps it pretty much to himself. ``I found that I
could easily volunteer that I had cancer. But not that I had breast
cancer. That part can be humiliating. People say they never heard
of it. I think they suspect there is something wrong with my
hormones.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl attended a support group once, but he was the only man
there and he probably won't go back. For now, he prefers to stay
anonymous and simply pass on a warning to other men to be aware.

 &HT;    Skin cancer victims run a greater risk of catching other forms
of cancer
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   People diagnosed with nonfatal forms of skin cancer have a 25
percent to 30 percent greater chance of ultimately dying from other
cancers, such as of the lung, breast and prostate, new research
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers with the American Cancer Society and Emory
University(Ga.) deemed the increased risk ``slight'' when compared
with other cancer risks _ such as tobacco and environmental toxins
_ they said it should be a motivator to get people to switch to
known cancer-fighting behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it sounds like a large number _ 25 to 30 percent _
it's a relatively low risk factor when compared to, say, smoking,
which can put a person at a 300 percent greater risk of dying of
cancer,'' said Dr. Michael Thun, an epidemiologist with the
Atlanta-based American Cancer Society and co-author of the study.
``But it's not a trivial number either. It means people who've
suffered skin cancer should take even more seriously the approaches
we know that reduce cancer risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Released in today's Journal of the American Medical Association,
the study compared 35,000 people who reported having skin cancer in
1982 to 1.1 million people without skin cancer who had enrolled in
a cancer prevention study in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The study took into account age, race, tobacco smoking, and
other factors known to be associated with cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not track patients with melanoma, the most serious
skin cancer that is responsible for about 7,300 annual deaths. It
followed people with nonmelanoma skin cancers, called basal cell or
squamous, that tend to grow slowly and rarely spread to other parts
of the body. More than 95 percent of the 1 million Americans
diagnosed with nomelanoma skin cancers are cured.
</P>
<P>
   This newest study is of great interest to the cancer-research
world as it proves a person is susceptible to other forms of cancer
years after being rid of another cancer, Thun said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said it's possible skin cancer can alter a person's
DNA or weaken the body's immune system, making it possible for
another cancer to develop years later.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Gulf beckons when trouble rears its head
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flood waters washing in from the Gulf of Mexico covered great
swatches of our island, including the roads, such as were left;
some were washed away. Our back yard was a pond replete with
croaking frogs. The dunes that constitute the front yard had been
sliced in two by the greedy waters, and whole clumps of cedar and
beach golden rod tumbled in the sound waters, a hazard to small
boats.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity was off so there would be no water, no working
bathrooms, no stove on which to prepare supper. But the house
looked sweet and welcoming, a pelican flew over with a friendly
honk, the rickety wooden walk from the front steps had survived _
many didn't _ and we hauled our gear up the steps glad to be there,
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   We really were lucky. Our house stood _ tattered screens
flapping, sand whooshing grittily over the floors.
</P>
<P>
   We settled on sandwiches for lunch and a front yard grill meal
for supper and finally went off to bed worrying about the neighbors
we heard from. One house on the Gulf side had been swallowed up by
the gigantic green jaws of the storm tides, and a friend who moved
to the island many years ago took comfort that he again had
beachfront property. He has moved his house back from the tide line
twice and felt secure that a shell-topped road stood between him
and the water. This year's hurricane took the road, the water moved
in, and he is once again on the beach. He is, they told me, calm
and philosophical about it.
</P>
<P>
   People who choose to live in hurricane country usually are. Our
friends Dr. and Mrs. Ivan Backerman found their walk to the beach
missing, their steps to the deck crumpled and piled up in the sand
like dirty laundry, and the dunes between them and the water
missing _ so there was a 10- or 15-foot drop from their deck to the
ground. They are already negotiating for a house mover who will
bury new pilings up by the road and set their house on them.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is true of our friends the Boatenreiters, who
live in one of the oldest and most charming houses on the island.
Storm tides washed the underpinnings from under their deck,
smothered Mary Ruth's pretty little vegetable garden with sand and
left the message that next time, next hurricane, the place they
have loved and cared for might be toppled into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Why do those of us who were Gulf Coast-reared insist on living _
or at least spending our time _ on the shoals of sure hurricane
visitations? I don't know. I was born not far from the oft-stormy
waters of Santa Rosa Sound. My mother reared me on stories of
preparing for hurricanes, living through them and finally cleaning
up after them. There were always scary moments, particularly that
time of complete deathly quiet when the center passed over us.
</P>
<P>
   You don't forget but you are accepting and appreciative of
whatever the storm leaves. For us, on our first night on the
island, it was bright moonlight and a sweet cool breeze from the
southwest.

 &HT;    Riding a high tide of revitalization, college town goes way
beyond football to museums, music and lovely homes
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala._The ``Roll Tide'' on the water tower was no
surprise. Neither was a certain college football coach's
black-and-white houndstooth check hat on display at a local museum.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have thought that in this quintessential Southern
college town you could also find a masosaur fossil called Sweetie,
a 13th-century stone Buddha, the state's only antebellum garden, a
'30s theater that was one of the last municipal buildings
constructed under the Work Projects Administration and an
archaeological site where the prehistoric metropolis of the South
thrived 800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuscaloosa may be famous as the home of the University of
Alabama, its storied football program and one of college football's
winningest coaches, Paul W. ``Bear'' Bryant. And, yes, there is a
museum dedicated to the Bear and Bama football history _ on Bryant
Drive. No doubt about it, Tuscaloosa is never more crowded than on
those fall Saturdays when 80,000 or so Crimson Tide fanatics
ro-o-oll into town and descend on Bryant-Denny Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think that's all there is to the town on the banks of
the Black Warrior River, you also probably assume Tuscaloosa Blonde
is a euphemism for an Alabama cheerleader (it happens to be one of
the beers at a trendy downtown brewpub).
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty to see and do here year-round. In addition to
historic museums on and off campus, there's a thriving cultural
community anchored by Theatre Tuscaloosa and the Tuscaloosa
Symphony as well as the University's Celebrity Series, which is
bringing in such artists as flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal and
violinist Midori this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bama, which opened as a moviehouse in 1938 with Cary Grant
and Katharine Hepburn's ``Bringing Up Baby,'' is an important part
of downtown's ongoing revitalization. Fox Theatre-like stars
twinkle in a blue sky above a Spanish-style courtyard setting with
trompe l'oeil paintings on the walls. Renovated in 1981 and placed
on the National Historic Register in 1984, the theater hosts
variety shows, concerts and ballet for school and community
audiences and is planning a classic film series.
</P>
<P>
   In the eclectic mix of downtown bars and restaurants _ from the
Alabama Grill (old-fashioned deviled eggs on the menu) to Javaweb
(a very '90s cyberspace cafe) _ is Barrett's Grillworks and Brewery
in the old Brown's department store at the corner of Greensboro and
University avenues. Here, connoisseurs can take the Brewmaster's
Brew Tour, five 5-ounce glasses of the six in-house brews, for
$4.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a marvelous time to be here,'' says Paul Looney,
executive director of Theatre Tuscaloosa, which opens its season
Oct. 16 in a new state-of-the-art theater at the Tuscaloosa Fine
Arts Centre of the campus of Shelton State University. ``You can
see the rhythms of the town changing. Who would have thought that
downtown would be a walking area with pubs, bars and blues clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuscaloosa's vitality is by no means confined to downtown and
the campus area.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Mississippian Indian mounds with ongoing
excavations can be found at Moundville Archaeological Park, a
320-acre National Historic Landmark 13 miles south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Black Warrior River to the north is the artsy
little town of Northport, home of the Kentuck Arts Center as well
as a revitalized downtown block with galleries, specialty shops and
the popular Globe restaurant. And 20 miles east of the city is the
Mercedes-Benz Visitor Center and Museum, adjacent to the
German-owned car-making factory.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at sightseeing highlights:
</P>
<P>
   -- Paul W. Bryant Museum: Here lies the hat. Actually, there are
several versions of coach Bryant's famous checked hat _ even one
crafted in crystal by Waterford in Ireland. Memorabilia, artifacts
and photographs from the beginning of Alabama football in 1892 to
the present are showcased along with interpretive videos about
famous Crimson Tide coaches, players and games. ``I think of this
as a history museum,'' director Kenneth Gaddy says. ``What we are
talking about is the people.'' Open 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily. $2; $1
children. 300 Bryant Drive (across from the Coliseum).
205-348-4668.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gorgas House: Built in 1829 as a dining hall, this Lowcountry
raised cottage was the first building on the University of Alabama
campus and one of only four to survive a Civil War torching. It was
remodeled as a residence in 1840, which it remained until 1953. Now
a house museum, it is furnished with antiques and memorabilia _
some of which belonged to the family of the university's seventh
president, Josiah Gorgas. 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Fridays; 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays; 2-4 p.m. Sundays. Free. Capstone
Drive. 205-348-5906.
</P>
<P>
   -- Alabama Museum of Natural History: Historic Smith Hall _ a
neoclassical building at Sixth Street and Capstone Drive in the
heart of campus _ was built 1907-1909. Here, you can see fossils
from as far back as the Ice Age, the horse-drawn wagon used by
Eugene Allen Smith (Alabama state geologist from 1873 to 1927), and
the Hodges Meteorite, which crashed through a roof in Sylacauga in
1954, hitting a woman on her leg. There's a working lab where
research on the masosaur (a marine reptile) named Sweetie is under
way. 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. weekdays; 1-4 p.m. Saturdays. $1; 50 cents
children. 205-348-7550.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Warner Collection at Gulf States Paper Corp.: Possibly
the city's biggest surprise is this collection of more than 150
American artworks in a 90,000-square-foot corporate headquarters
tucked into the woods above the river. Designed by late Atlanta
architect Cecil Alexander, the sprawling complex, which opened in
1970, evokes a Japanese teahouse with gardens with koi-filled ponds
and exotic caged birds. Retired Gulf States CEO Jack Warner has
amassed one of the world's largest private collections on public
view. Artists include Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, John Singer
Sargeant, Winslow Homer, Thomas Hart Benton and all the Wyeths.
Plus, there are totems from the South Pacific, tribal masks from
New Guinea, Japanese campaign chests, a 13th-century Buddha and 95
wild bird portraits by British artist Basil Ede. Tours 5:30 and
6:30 p.m. weekdays and on the hour 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays and 1-4
p.m. Sundays. Free. 1400 River Road. 205-553-6200.
</P>
<P>
   -- Battle-Friedman House: Wealthy businessman Alfred Battle
built this two-story brick townhouse in 1835, when Tuscaloosa was
still the state capitol. Architectural detailing reflects both
Federal and Greek Revival influences. In 1844, Millicent Battle
employed an English landscape designer, who provided an intricate
design of interlocking diamond-shaped beds and paths. The
antebellum gardens were restored to their original design last
year. Today the home and gardens are maintained by the Tuscaloosa
County Preservation Society. Some of the period furnishings
belonged to the Battles and Friedmans. In the north parlor is a
table that once belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Isidor Straus, owners of
R.H. Macy's, who died on the Titanic. Tours 10 a.m.-noon and 1-4
p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays and 1-4 p.m. Sundays. $3. 1010 Greensboro
Ave. 205-758-6138.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mercedes-Benz Visitor Center: Tours of the only Mercedes
plant outside Europe are offered Mondays through Fridays by
reservation for ages 12 and older. No shorts, above-the-knee skirts
or sandals allowed in the factory. The exhibition hall, which
traces the history of the car maker from 1886 to the present, is
open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Fridays and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturdays.
$4; $3 senior citizens and children. I-59/20 at Exit 89 in Vance.
1-888-286-8762.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: It's about 200 miles _ a 3 1/2 hour drive _
from Atlanta via I-20 west.
</P>

   Alabama: Upcoming events
</P>
<P>
   Eye distant past at native festival
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's earliest residents _ a highly advanced society that
thrived on the highest bluff of the Black Warrior River _ will be
remembered during the 10th Annual Moundville Native American
Festival at Moundville Archaeological Park on Sept. 22-26.
Southeastern tribes will showcase the culture of their ancestors at
the site, where an agrarian community of 3,000 lived around
1,000-1,500 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best-preserved sites of its kind in the
country,'' says Betsy Jones, the park's director of education and
festival coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The five-day event at the national historic landmark features
demonstrations of skills such as basket weaving, beadwork, blowgun
making and flint knapping; preparation of foods and medicines;
stickball games and traditional songs and dances.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian Market offers Native American arts and crafts. Also,
fry bread and other foods will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   A living history camp re-creates the life of Creek Indians and
early settlers in Alabama during the late 18th century and provides
hands-on experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippian Indians constructed the large earthworks topped by
temples, council houses and homes of nobility.
</P>
<P>
   More than 26 of these flat-topped mounds survive, the largest 60
feet tall. Excavation of the ancient artistic and ceremonial center
began in the 1930s as Civilian Conservation Corps workers
discovered some of the most prized artifacts ever found in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, built by the CCC, contains pottery, stone and clay
pipes, artifacts and a distinctive sandstone disc with rattlesnake
motif.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Sept. 22-25 and 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
Sept. 26. $5; $3 children. A free Lantern Tour of the living
history camp will be 7-9 p.m. Sept. 24 (call 205-348-0050 to
register). Moundville, open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. daily, is 13 miles south
of Tuscaloosa on Ala. 69 south. 205-371-2234.
</P>
<P>
   See folk crafts in their prime
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Kentuck Festival of the Arts in Northport on Oct. 17-18
will once again feature some of the South's best folk art. But
that's not all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kentuck is primarily known as a folk art festival, but we have
a full range of fine art,'' says Kentuck Art Center director Miah
Michaelson. ``We're trying to branch out. We are the largest visual
arts festival in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the works of more than 300 artists (paintings,
sculptures, furniture, pottery, whirligigs _ you name it), the
festival includes two music stages featuring acts such as Iris
DeMent, the gospel trio D'Vine and the banjo-thrashing Bad Livers.
Youngsters can dabble in tie-dye, mold clay, decorate an art car
and craft a corn-shuck doll at a children's area.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelson says part of the festival and art center's mission is
to preserve traditional crafts such as basket making and candle
making _ two of the skills that will be spotlighted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentuck Art Center, at 503 Main Ave. in Northport, is home
to a museum, two exhibition galleries, a gift shop and seven
artists' studios. Festival hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Oct. 17, 9
a.m.-5 p.m. Oct. 18. $5; $2 children 6-12. From I-20/59 take Exit
71 to Ala. 69 north. Cross the Black Warrior River and take the
first Northport exit. Kentuck Park is 1/2 mile west of Main Avenue.
205-758-1257.

 &HT;    Baseball pre-empts second part of ``Hill'' cliffhanger
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Propane may be big in Arlen, Texas, but it's not bigger than
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Fox's animated ``King of the Hill'' will have to wait
until next Tuesday to watch the 'toon's season premiere _ and learn
who bites the dust in the propane explosion at fictitional Arlen's
Mega Lo Mart shown in last season's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Fox pre-empted Tuesday night's debuts of ``King'' and the new
sitcom ``Costello'' and a fresh episode of ``Guinness World
Records: Primetime'' to show the St. Louis Cardinals-Chicago Cubs
baseball game with home run sluggers McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``King'' will now start its new season at 8 p.m. ET next
Tuesday. ``Costello'' will then air at 8:30 p.m., with ``Guinness''
at 9 p.m.

   MOTT _ CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Now meet U.S. Sugar's quiet but
important partner, 1,100 miles away in Flint, Mich., the home of
General Motors Corp.'s Buick division. People therehere measure
prosperity not by the cars they drive but by the cars they build.
And much as nearly everything in Clewiston bears the stamp of U.S.

   CHARLES-MOTT _ Charles Stewart Mott once, the story goes,
changed a 30-watt refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save
electricity. That might not have been unusual for someone who'd
endured the Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the
country's 15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered

   EQUIFAX-CEO _ A lot has changed since Thomas F. Chapman ran into
a brick wall when he went looking for help from Equifax. Now,
Equifax offers the kind of information Chapman needed. And Chapman

   EQUIFAX-STRATEGY _ The strategy for Equifax was set with the

Equifax's products into more useful and valuable offerings. That's

   MONEY-TALK _ Pre-retirement planning has gained greater notice
in the last few weeks. The stock market has flayed investors of all

   TECH-REPORT _ Hand-held cellular phones have taken another leap
forward in the arena of personal safety. Audiovox has unveiled the
FoneFinder, a hand-held that can be vehicle-mounted and has a
Global Positioning Satellite receiver built in to pinpoint the
location of 911 callers. With a touch of the large 911 button on

 &HT;    MEDICARE PANEL GETS PLENTY OF REFORM SUGGESTIONS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bipartisan Medicare commission got an earful of
suggestions Monday on how _ and how not _ to reform the nation's
health care system for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In a daylong hearing, the commission _ which is scheduled next
March to recommend long-term revisions to Medicare _ received
conflicting suggestions from a broad spectrum of health care
advocacy and interest groups over the wisdom of issuing insurance
vouchers, increasing managed care coverage and expanding the
program to include long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not give any indication of what recommendations it
would adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Among the central issues for Medicare, which is scheduled to run
out of money to fully cover hospital costs in about 10 years, is
whether the system should be changed from one in which the
government sets premiums and defines benefits to one in which
people purchase their own federally subsidized coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Several advocacy groups, including the American Medical
Association and the conservative Cato Institute, urged the panel to
shift to private medical savings accounts as the best way of
restraining the cost of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-free medical savings accounts would be financed by
payroll deductions and employer contributions _ similar to the
current system _ but would be used to purchase private health care
coverage which high deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Litow, an actuary for the Council for Affordable Health
Insurance, argued that the current system, in which the government
sets premiums and payment rates, results in an ineffective and
costly program.
</P>
<P>
   Using private accounts would give consumers a greater choice of
benefits and force providers to offer more efficient services,
Litow said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Rogers, a former Florida congressman, warned that
private medical accounts _ vouchers for a specific amount of money
_ would not adequately coverage the insurance needs of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, co-chairman of the National Coalition on Health Care,
warned that as health care costs outpaced vouchers, millions of
poor beneficiaries would be priced out of the insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge the commission not to abandon the guarantee of a
minimum benefit package,'' Rogers said, arguing for a system in
which a government voucher would cover a minimum benefit package.
Insurers would bid to provide those benefits, with the government
selecting the lowest bid on a region-by-region basis.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry urged the commission to consider
Medicare reforms that would reverse payment limits imposed in last
year's Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, told the panel that last year's reforms will result in
payments to health maintenance organizations that are
``significantly behind payments under the fee-for-service program.
As a result of these reductions, many plans may have to cut
benefits, raise premiums or both.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said he was concerned that HMOs
were advertising extensive benefits in order to attract customers
and then reducing services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a little bit like bait-and-switch to me,'' McDermott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kahn III, representing the Health Insurance Industry of
America, urged the panel to retain the option for seniors to
purchase so-call ``medigap'' insurance to cover benefits not
provided by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn suggested that the current fee-for-service system would
likely remain a major option for the elderly and that medigap
policies would be necessary to protect them from large
out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The American Health Care Association, which represents more than
11,000 non-profit assisted living and nursing home facilities,
urged the commission to recommend the creation of a similar panel
to assess the issues of long-term care, which are primarily
financed by the federal-state Medicaid system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Willig, the association's executive vice president,
noted that two out of five Americans will need long-term care at
some point in their lives, and that three out of four cannot afford
the more than $40,000 annual cost for nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicare pays only a small portion of long-term care
costs, Willig said ``hundreds of thousands of aging Americans ...
must impoverish themselves to qualify for Medicaid assistance. It
is a demeaning inequity in our nation's health care system.''

who are Matt Tittle, Patrick Fletcher and Eric Crouch to disagree?
For that matter, who are they, period? Before the football season,
they weren't exactly household names, except perhaps in their own
households. Before Saturday, September 5, they were seldom-used

on Sept. 5 against No. 23 Texas, has a first-year defensive
coordinator, a new defensive scheme and plenty of questions.
``We'll go into the game not knowing how they'll line up,''
Longhorns Coach Mack Brown said. Unhappy with the Longhorns'
second-half ineffectiveness against New Mexico State in the season
opener, Brown and coordinator Carl Reese have shuffled the lineup.

important partner, 1,100 miles away in Flint, Mich., the home of
General Motors Corp.'s Buick division. People therehere measure
prosperity not by the cars they drive but by the cars they build.
And much as nearly everything in Clewiston bears the stamp of U.S.
Sugar, nearly everything in Flint bears the stamp of General Motors
and an early G.M. investor named Charles Stewart Mott. (Peltz, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

   WITH
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES-MOTT _ Charles Stewart Mott once, the story goes,
changed a 30-watt refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save
electricity. That might not have been unusual for someone who'd
endured the Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the
country's 15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered
one of the richest men in the United States. Still, he prized
simplicity. (Peltz, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EQUIFAX-CEO _ A lot has changed since Thomas F. Chapman ran into
a brick wall when he went looking for help from Equifax. Now,
Equifax offers the kind of information Chapman needed. And Chapman
is president _ since August 1997 _ and chief executive officer _
since January _ of the Atlanta-based credit reporting and
information services company. (McNaughton, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   EQUIFAX-STRATEGY _ The strategy for Equifax was set with the
arrival in 1987 of C.B. ``Jack'' Rogers Jr. as president and chief
operating officer. His job was to use technology to transform
Equifax's products into more useful and valuable offerings. That's
still the idea: selling information rather than raw data. And it
continues under Thomas F. Chapman, the current president and chief
executive officer. (McNaughton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ Economists are wondering whether the stock
market's recent gyrations will lead to a significant decline in
consumer spending. As a baby boomer, allow me to make this
prediction: No. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-TALK _ Pre-retirement planning has gained greater notice
in the last few weeks. The stock market has flayed investors of all
ages. But the scare has been particularly acute for those who are
near retirement and who had been jubilant about the rapidly
increasing value of their investments. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ Continuing our small exploration of voice
recognition programs, we'll take a look today at IBM ViaVoice Gold,
a program that has a few startling similarities to Voice Xpress
Plus but in general is a quite different program. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Hand-held cellular phones have taken another leap
forward in the arena of personal safety. Audiovox has unveiled the
FoneFinder, a hand-held that can be vehicle-mounted and has a
Global Positioning Satellite receiver built in to pinpoint the
location of 911 callers. With a touch of the large 911 button on
the top of the phone, the phone and its GPS receiver are turned on.
A built-in speech chip announces the caller's location to emergency
dispatchers. (Ghirardini, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ In this age of the Internet and 24-hour news
television, anyone can become a celebrity overnight. Which also
means you can just as quickly become a target for public scrutiny.
``Spin,'' a new book by spin doctor Michael S. Sitrick and
journalist Allan Mayer, talks about this modern phenomenon and how
you can make it work for you. (Haddad, Atlanta

popular songs from around the world with a sing-along CD-ROM
program called Children's Songbook. (Davis, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ The big news in technology this past week came
from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where researchers
discovered that people who spent hours and hours on the Internet
each night didn't have time left to have any real human
relationships. What a surprise that was. It is roughly equivalent
to discovering that people who walk in the rain get wet and then
long to be dry. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ MTV's Web site seems a prime candidate for teenage
hackers who like to mess with big-time sites. For a while last
week, it looked as if MTV had indeed been hacked. As it turns out,
the defaced start page was actually created by MTV itself as a
promotion for Thursday's ``MTV Video Music Awards.'' (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ It looks like a gumdrop but is working like a life
saver. Apple Computer's new iMac is not only selling well but
drawing new users to the platform. That was unthinkable just a few
months ago, when most company observers were saying, at best, Apple
Computer would remain a niche player catering to Mac aficionados.

<P>
   The last successful phase of the Oslo peace process occurred in
January 1997, with the Hebron agreement. Israeli troops withdrew

</P>
<P>
   March 7, 1997: Deadline for next Israeli withdrawal passes after
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat scoffs at Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's offer to hand over 2 percent of
new West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   March 14, 1997: Israeli cabinet approves plan for 6,500 Jewish
homes on Jerusalem hill known as Har Homa to Jews and Jabal Abu
Ghneim to Arabs. Israel captured the land in the 1967 war, but
Palestinians consider it theirs.
</P>
<P>
   March 21, 1997: Palestinian suicide bomber kills three Israeli
women in a Tel Aviv cafe.
</P>

the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
   July 30, 1997: As U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tries to restart peace
talks, two Palestinian suicide bombers kill 17 Israelis in
Jerusalem's Mehaneh Yehuda produce market. Israel seals off borders
to Palestinian workers and calls off talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4, 1997: Two weeks before U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is to visit Israel, three Palestinian suicide
bombers kill four Israelis in Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda cafe district.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 12, 1997: Albright leaves Israel, reporting little
progress and saying she will not come back again to ``tread
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1997: Israel releases from prison Hamas founder Ahmed
Yassin at the demand of Jordanian King Hussein, who is outraged
that Israeli agents tried to kill a Hamas figure in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 8, 1997: With Yassin -- a rival to Arafat -- back in Gaza,
Arafat and Netanyahu hold a hastily arranged, pre-dawn, summit to
discuss security. This is the last time they have met.
</P>
<P>
   January 1998: Arafat and Netanyahu meet separately with
President Bill Clinton at the White House. No progress achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 1, 1998: Albright visits Israel again and reports no
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Early February 1998: U.S. promotes plan for Israel to turn over
13 percent more of the West Bank to the Palestinians as the next
step in the Oslo process. Arafat eventually accepts, Netanyahu does

independence.
</P>
<P>
   July 19, 1998: For the first time in almost six months, top
Israeli and Palestinian officials meet.
</P>
<P>
   August 1998: In two attacks in the West Bank, Palestinians kill
two settlers in Itzhar and a rabbi in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1, 1998: Deadline for another Israeli withdrawal passes
with no movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9, 1998: U.S. Ambassador Dennis Ross visits in an attempt

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Five years ago on the White House lawn(CQ date),
President Bill Clinton gave then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin a famous nudge, moving him close to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat so they would shake hands on the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians have been vying for position ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an 18-month freeze in the peace negotiations, both sides
seek leverage over how the process ends and what land, ultimately,
changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   On the rocky hillsides of the West Bank, Jews and Arabs stake
their claims. There is still frequent scenes of violence, featuring
attacks by Palestinian terrorists and stone throwing Palestinian
youth or heavily armed Israeli soldiers and scuffling Jewish
settlers. Meanwhile, political leaders unveil schemes aimed at
getting an edge in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see here is an attempt to maintain bargaining chips
for the end game,'' said Joel Singer, an Israeli author of the Oslo
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, U.S. envoys work to broker the next step in Oslo,
which would be another Israeli withdrawal from part of the West
Bank land it captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is that this is not the last move in the game.
</P>
<P>
   More important issues come later, such as whether Israel will
share Jerusalem, whether some settlements are dismantled, or
whether there will be a return or compensation of the 3.4 million
Palestinian refugees, and their descendants, who left Israel during
the 1948 war.
</P>
<P>
   The strategies are clear.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel gives up less of the West Bank now, it can give it in
the final talks and resist pressure to give on the other issues.
Conversely, the more land the Palestinians get in their pocket now,
the more they will be able to focus the final talks on Jerusalem,
refugees and settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL THE STRONGER PARTY
</P>
<P>
   Most of the chips are on the Israeli side of the table. Israel
has the land the Palestinians want and populates it with 170,000
settlers. It has an army to hold it and an ally in the de facto
mediator, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian power relies on a slight upswing in world opinion.
Arafat has accepted a U.S. proposed plan to end the deadlock, but
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was a harsh critic
of Oslo when Rabin signed it, has not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also has some land now and a police force that Israelis
fear is a budding militia.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he has what some call the ``negative power'' -- the
likelihood that if Oslo fails, the 2.5 million Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza will, with Arafat's backing, rise up in a bloody
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background comes the daily thrust and parry.
</P>
<P>
   When two Jewish settlers were killed in a suspected Palestinian
terror attack last month, the leaders of their small Itzhar
neighborhood announced they would build 15 more homes. The message:
Not only aren't they going anywhere, they will grow.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli group Peace Now estimates that in the last 18 months
construction has started on about 3,000 new homes for Jews in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   With these neighborhoods, and the highways that connect them,
come confiscations of long-time Arab lands. According to the
Israeli army, it has destroyed 190 Arab homes so far this year, up
from 180 most years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats criticize the moves, saying negotiations, not
bulldozers, must determine who gets the land.
</P>
<P>
   ARABS' CASUALTIES DOWN, ISRAELIS' UP
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the violent ways of asserting power.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, Israeli
soldiers or civilians have killed 326 Palestinians since Oslo was
signed through July. Palestinians have killed 226 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, that is a huge drop caused by the Israeli
army's withdrawal from almost all populated Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, the figure is a huge increase, due largely to
bombings that many say are attempts by Arafat's rivals to derail
Oslo and create an all-out war between the Jews and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feared that with the birth of this horrible, nightmare of
an agreement there would be more bloodshed and we've seen it,''
said Yehudit Tayar, a spokesperson for YESHA, which represents
settlements and threatens to use its power to topple Netanyahu's
government if he gives away too much.
</P>
<P>
   Since roughly the time the talks have stalled, 34 Palestinians
and 24 Israelis have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the arena for maneuvers range from the United
Nations to city hall.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.N. recently upgraded the observer status of the
Palestinians, that was a step toward Arafat's vow to declare
Palestinian statehood on May 4, 1999, the date the Oslo accords
expire. This is an unsettling threat. Israeli leaders say that
could lead them to re-invade the land they have so far given,
because Oslo relies on any statehood being negotiated, not
declared.
</P>
<P>
   In parallel, Israelis in June proposed widening their authority
over Arab areas near Jerusalem. That angered Palestinians who say
Jerusalem's boundaries should be negotiated, not declared.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, tension rises to a dangerous level.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police are now wary of plots by Jewish extremists to
kill the Israeli defense minister or Netanyahu -- the fate met by
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians still support Oslo, according to
polls, but the support has been falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of damage has been done in the last 18 months,'' said
Arafat spokesman Marwan Kanafani. ``The damage has hurt the idea of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel sees it differently,
citing the slowing of Palestinian rioting and threats during the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all part of their plan to try to soften up the
Israeli government,'' Fogel said. ``(The stalemate) should have had
a sobering effect on the Palestinians to show them that all these
gimmicks and tactics aren't going to lead them anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   SWISS CHEESE GEOGRAPHY
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo process, in midstream, has created a jumble of
Israeli-Palestinian borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, more than 95 percent of the Palestinian
population is now in areas partially or completely controlled by
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes up only 27 percent of the land and, in most of
that, Palestinians only control civil affairs while Israeli army
jeep patrols still reign.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Swiss cheese geography, with Palestinians living in
more than 100 enclaves surrounded by Israeli checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   On the hilltops are 127 Jewish settlements, often resembling
condominiums. They pose a problem for Oslo because they were
scattered in a pattern designed to interrupt any solid block of
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
   American officials want Israel to give up another 13 percent of
the West Bank to keep the process moving. Netanyahu said he needs
more security assurances.
</P>
<P>
   He demands that Arafat fulfill a promise to convene the leaders
of the international Palestine Liberation Organization and revoke
the many parts of its charter that call for war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The group has voted once to amend its charter generally for
Oslo, however, the specific revisions were never made.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA recently restarted Israeli-Palestinian talks on an
anti-terrorism security agreement that Netanyahu rejected several
months ago. An agreement could give him political cover for backing
to grant more land.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a suicide bombing in Israel in over a year,
which experts attribute to a leadership crisis in the extremist
group Hamas and probably extra vigilance by Arafat -- whose own
fate is now linked to preserving the Oslo agreement he signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an improvement, but it is not optimum,'' said Carmi
Gillon, former head of Israel's internal security force, Shin Bet.
``Nowadays, Arafat realizes that terrorist acts are against his
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Israelis oppose giving up more land until Arafat
improves security, Palestinian leaders frequently attribute
terrorism to frustration caused by Israel's reluctance to turn over
land.

</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He has heard the demands from the Israeli government
and received training from the CIA, but is Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat fighting terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   It is a year since the last time suicide bombers sent nails and
terror ripping through an Israeli crowd, though several individual
murders have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operations have come down because of the huge crackdown (from
Arafat),'' said Ibrihim Gosheh, a spokesman in Jordan for the Hamas
extremist group that often takes credit for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, opinions of Arafat's record vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   His police force is several thousand officers over what is
allowed under the Oslo accords, but analysts say that may help him
keep peace. He refuses to extradite terrorists to Israel, but
observers point out that he would not be required to if the
terrorists were tried by his authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas is Arafat's political rival. If the peace process fails,
Hamas is vindicated and Arafat will be seen as having misled his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Khatib, director of a Palestinian research group, said
that contrary to some claims, Arafat would not use Hamas bombings
to influence peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will never allow himself to become dependent on his
opponents,'' Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians note that Israelis could not stop terror when they
controlled all the land.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has jailed some Hamas leaders, but Carmi Gillon, former
head of Israel's internal security force, said mostly he fights
terror by pressuring the families of the extremists. Arafat's
record has improved, he said, but it is not how Israelis fight
terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Palestinians) think that if you put a Hamas member in
the police it will convince him not to be a terrorist,'' Gillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA trains Palestinian police in anti-terrorism and even on
securing its phone lines from Israeli listening devices, according
to Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Bar Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said one of Arafat's security chiefs recently met with a
top terrorist leader -- a friend from their time in Israeli jails
-- and told him he would face stiff punishment if any terror was
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Arafat
responds to specific threats, but does not break the terrorist
network -- he spears the fish one by one, rather than casting a
net.

 &HT;    HOUSE WHIP JUGGLES GOP ROLES
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thanks to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, House
Republicans learned that they can expect to vote today to create
two commemorative coins and name five post offices after deserving
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Also thanks to DeLay, they were given a point-by-point rebuttal
to the request from President Clinton's lawyer that he be given an
early peek at any report from independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The two advisories were a reflection of the dual jobs that the
Texas Republican is juggling as both the top Republican in charge
of rounding up House votes and as the self-designated source of
information about impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information ... is what we're providing,'' said DeLay's
spokesman, Michael Scanlon. The whip's staff is providing ``just
about anything under the sun you could need research on,'' from how
special counsel Leon Jaworski of Houston handled his investigation
of President Nixon to the special oath that senators must take
before trying a president on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having this sort of information is useful for answering
constituents' questions,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has been the most outspoken of the House leaders about
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, calling for the president's
resignation within a day of his admission that he lied about the
affair. DeLay has also suggested that Starr's full report be made
public as soon as it arrives at the Capitol and that the House stay
in session past early October to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom believes the guy is not fit to be president,'' Scanlon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite DeLay's strong feelings, his staff insists that the
impeachment-information service they're running isn't what critics
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information we give to members is not intended for them
to run out and start calling for the president's impeachment,''
Scanlon said. ``It serves other purposes. One is information, one
is background, and third is to be involved in the public debate on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The public debate Tuesday, as suggested by DeLay's office, was a
refutation of assertions made by Clinton's lawyer in a letter sent
Monday to Starr. David Kendall asked Starr for an advance copy of
any report going to Congress and hinted that he may mount a legal
challenge to Starr's authority to report directly to Congress.
Kendall also faxed copies of the letter to various reporters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, as congressman, responded with a press release blasting
Kendall for ``trying to grab headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall's actions reek of politics,'' he said in his press
statement. ``This request is nothing more than a PR move, and it
may backfire on him.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, as information resource, provided House Republicans with
``talking points'' on the Kendall letter that include comparisons
of the Watergate investigation with Starr's investigation and note
changes in federal law that would allow Starr to report to
Congress:
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall claims that the IC (independent counsel) may not even
have legal grounds for submitting a report. How does he want him to
do it? A phone call? (Actually, what they want is for Starr to come
up and testify so they can try and make him look like a fool.) It
is ridiculous to say that Starr cannot or should not submit a
report. This is a desperate attempt by the White House to keep the
American people and Congress from finding out the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon insisted the advisories being created by DeLay's staff
are just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were pumping out press releases and talking points on
why Bill Clinton is a bad person, then that would be partisan,'' he
said. Providing information on the censure or impeachment of the
president, he said, ``that's not partisan.''

LIFE (WITH MARIS AROUND) WAS NOT FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Duplication warning: Story also moved in ``A'' category)  
 By SAM LOWE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ We sat as strangers, sharing space and watching TV
because Mark McGwire might hit a baseball beyond the confines of
Busch Stadium. My companions were all young people who cheered
every time the St. Louis first baseman came to the plate in the
hope that he'd hear them and knock one out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Although I wished McGwire well, I did not share the enthusiasm
of my temporary associates. Every time McGwire hits a home run, it
diminishes my personal claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   This goes back to the summer of 1950, when I played baseball
against Roger Maris. I was considerably younger then, and the
passing years have clouded my memory somewhat, but there are things
that stick with you forever.
</P>
<P>
   And Roger Maris was one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Fargo American Legion team; I played for
Jamestown, 100 miles to the west. We faced each other twice that
summer. His team won both games by lopsided scores and eventually
went on to capture the state championship.
</P>
<P>
   He was Roger Maras then, (I'll explain that later), a
15-year-old who commanded so much respect that we put on the Maras
Shift every time he came to the plate. He batted left-handed, so in
what we considered a clever display in skill and cunning, we moved
all our infielders and outfielders to the right side of the
diamond, so we could catch the ball when he hit it toward us.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, however, it was a case of seven players putting
up a brave front while secretly hoping that if he did whack the
ball it would go toward someone else. Even at that tender age,
Maras hit line shots that would have drilled a hole right through
us if we were dumb enough to get in front of one. And we'd be left
standing there with a big cavity in our chest and feeling as stupid
as Wile E. Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. We loved baseball,
but none of us was so enamored with the game that we were willing
to sacrifice our bodies for an out, even if it was against Roger
Maras.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was a futile gesture anyway _ we never got him out. He
hit the ball and our infielders ducked, then hollered instructions
to our second line of defense _ the outfielders. A small band of
hearty souls, we had positioned ourselves against the outfield
fences so we could see the ball as it sped toward us. This reduced
the possibility of getting hit on the back of the head by a line
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it wasn't Roger Maras who was supposed to be doing
this to us. His brother, Rudy, was the original reason for the
Maras Shift because we had played against him the previous year and
he had been very unkind to our pitching staff. But now we also had
to deal with his brother, who was just as talented, even though he
was only 15. It was one of our first exposures to the theory that
life is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   So we played the two games against Fargo, got creamed by what
seemed like a total of 50 runs, and tried to put it all behind us
by joking that we'd been beaten by worse teams, which was true. We
finished the season with a 4-16 record. Roger Maras was selected as
the most valuable player for the Fargo team after it won the state
title. The honor came shortly before his 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   I graduated from the American Legion program after that season,
but Roger continued his assault on our family for another year. In
the summer of 1951, my brother Jim pitched against him in a game in
Jamestown. They faced each other four times. My brother struck him
out in their first three encounters, something that still comes up
regularly at family reunions. But on his fourth trip to the plate,
Maras hit the ball so hard that those who witnessed it swear it was
still climbing when it cleared the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   They never found the ball. The assumption was that it landed in
the river across the road from the ballpark. That meant it was
airborne for about 400 feet. Understandably, this is still not a
popular discussion topic when our family convenes.
</P>
<P>
   I saw him in person only once more, in 1953. He was 19, playing
with the Fargo-Moorhead Twins, a Cleveland Indians farm team in the
Class C Northern League. His brother and I were teammates on the
North Dakota State Baseball Squad, and Rudy got us free tickets to
the Twins games. One night I yelled at Roger as he ran in from the
outfield. Without breaking stride he waved and said, ``Hey,
Jamestown.'' The gesture not only eased some of the grief he had
caused me and my family, but also elevated my stature in the eyes
of my classmates. ``You know him?'' they asked. ``Yup,'' I replied.
``Played against him a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time I ever uttered the phrase, and it earned
me so much respect that it has been a standard in my conversational
English since then.
</P>
<P>
   Maras played 114 games with the Twins that summer, hitting .325
with nine homers and earning the league's Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the spelling occurred in 1955, said Sid Cichyi,
who coached the brothers when they attended Shanley High School in
Fargo. ``Roger was playing with Keokuk, Iowa, and some of the fans
began taunting him by emphasizing the last syllable of his name,''
Cichyi said. ``This upset his dad so much that he had the family
name legally changed to Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Both spellings appear in the Maris memorabilia on display at the
Roger Maris museum, located in the West Acres shopping mall in
Fargo. The museum, actually a large glass enclosure in one of the
walkways, tracks Maris' baseball career from his American Legion
days until he retired in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   A steady trickle of fans stopped to look and comment Saturday.
``He had such a sweet swing,'' said Bev Grande of Fargo, who
watched him many years ago. ``I hate to see his record broken,
because it means something to me personally. But at least the
attention is getting him some favorable publicity. When he was
chasing Babe Ruth's record, the sportswriters didn't like him,
because Ruth was such a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man who refused to give his name was more emphatic.
``I'd like to break McGwire's kneecap,'' he growled. ``Now
everybody will forget about Maris, and he was a great ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude was different in the watering hole where dozens of
us watched McGwire's pursuit of the home run record over the
weekend. Whenever McGwire came to bat, everyone cheered except me.
And when he hit No. 60 on Saturday, a few of the younger people
showed unrestrained exuberance. I questioned this show of
non-support for the hometown hero who is immortalized a couple of
miles south of where we sat and buried just a few miles north.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Lewis, 27, gave me a plausible explanation. ``The older
people don't want the record broken because they associate with
Maris,'' he said. ``But he had his time. McGwire is our generation.
Let him have his glory now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I guess that makes me old. And I realized that I've also
been rather selfish in this matter. For 37 years, I have been using
my playing time against Roger Maris as one of those little
eyebrow-lifters tossed into a conversation to get attention. But my
position as a minor sports celebrity is on shaky ground and will
diminish now that McGwire tied Maris with his 61st home run, then
surpasses it with his 62nd. I firmly believe he will do it. And
that will reduce my bragging rights to a mere whisper of what they
used to be. It will still be important to me, but overall, my niche
in sports history just got a lot smaller.
</P>
<P>
   I don't climb down from my self-constructed pedestal willingly,
however. Even as I write this, I am thinking about Darin Erstad, a
rising star with the Anaheim Angels. He's from Jamestown. There's
got to be some tie-in between me and him . . . &QL;

A BALLOT WITHOUT A LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's primary election day in Arizona and, once again,
the so-called news media in our community has failed to provide us
with the facts we need to make informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the working press, I'm embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the voting public, I'm outraged.
</P>
<P>
   How are we supposed to differentiate between good politicians
and bad when all we know about the candidates are their party
affiliations, their qualifications and their positions on the
issues?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but didn't a single hack in this backwater burb think
to ask political hopefuls the basic ``who, what, when, where and
why'' questions?
</P>
<P>
   As in, Whom are you sleeping with?
</P>
<P>
   What exactly do you do?
</P>
<P>
   When do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we can guess why. But, as for the rest, how can we be
expected to make intelligent decisions about leadership without the
kind of vital information voters receive in cities like Washington,
D.C.?
</P>
<P>
   The candidates say they want to lower taxes. So? What voters
need to know is, did these people ever lie on their tax returns?
</P>
<P>
   Not once? Not on a single deduction? An inflated expense
account? A long shot that came in at the track?
</P>
<P>
   What about health care?
</P>
<P>
   Did any of the folks running for office ever call in ``sick'' on
a really nice day? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did the dog do it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's education.
</P>
<P>
   Have our political candidates ever told a teacher the dog ate
their homework?
</P>
<P>
   Did they ever tell a cop they really (begin ital) did (end ital)
come to a complete stop at the intersection? Or that it was their
``index'' finger being used to give directions to another driver?
</P>
<P>
   All political candidates say honesty is important. They all
promise to be truthful.
</P>
<P>
   But, would telephone solicitors agree?
</P>
<P>
   Were the politicians on the line really ``about to sit down for
dinner,'' ``in the middle of changing a diaper'' or ``hard of
hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   And was it true when they told the Jehovah's Witnesses at the
door, ``We don't speakie da English?''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with the reporters here?
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with voters?
</P>
<P>
   All politicians promise to take criminals off the streets,
reduce the number of government regulations and encourage business.
</P>
<P>
   What about (begin ital) their (end ital) business?
</P>
<P>
   Do they eat their broccoli?
</P>
<P>
   Do they drink right out of the milk carton?
</P>
<P>
   Do they brush between meals?
</P>
<P>
   Do they leave the toilet seat up?
</P>
<P>
   Do they cry at Hallmark commercials? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Important questions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the national news and read big-city papers. These
things are important. They must be.
</P>
<P>
   Have any of the candidates ever watched ``Jerry Springer''?
</P>
<P>
   Appeared on ``Jerry Springer''?
</P>
<P>
   Invested in an Arkansas real estate deal with Jerry Springer?
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arizona, voters simply haven't been presented with the
kind of data citizens in the rest of the United States seem to
consider essential.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Like when one candidate for state attorney general produced a TV
commercial calling another candidate a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Or when a third attorney general candidate went out of her way
to say she is not gay.
</P>
<P>
   But, why aren't reporters asking what would seem to be the
obvious follow-up questions?
</P>
<P>
   Do they dye their hair?
</P>
<P>
   Do they cheat at solitaire?
</P>
<P>
   Have they ever torn the tab from a mattress or pillow?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what's wrong with us _ lack of savoir-faire, maybe
_ but not a single candidate in our state has been asked to respond
to the one-word inquiry that seems to preoccupy voters everywhere
else:
</P>
<P>
   Intern? &QL;

RENAMED TOBACCO COMPANY LEADS BRITAIN'S BLUE CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Shares in the renamed British American Tobacco PLC
soared far ahead of the rest of London's lackluster stock market
Tuesday in the first day's trading since the company sold its
financial services arm to the Zurich Group.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the newly merged Allied Zurich PLC lost
ground, reflecting stock analysts' pessimism about the combined
financial unit. Analysts said the rise in British American Tobacco
stock sent a clear message that investors, who had widely seen
BAT's tobacco operations as undervalued because of the effect of
the financial business, were expecting tobacco price increases in
the United States in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to spin off the financial operations of what had
been BAT Industries PLC was interpreted by some analysts as an
effort to court investors who had been troubled by tobacco-related
litigation in the United States. But Michael Prideaux, a spokesman
for British American Tobacco, based here, dismissed those
assessments as ``the sort of battle cry'' of the tobacco industry's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what we were doing,'' Prideaux said, ``it was
to merge the financial services with a very strong partner to
enable them to grow more rapidly.'' American tobacco-related
settlements ``did not play a role at all,'' he said, although ``we
kept an eye on it.''
</P>
<P>
   British American Tobacco led Britain's blue chips Tuesday,
rising 1.285 pounds, or 38 percent, to 4.66 pounds, while the
benchmark British stock index closed slightly lower, in contrast to
gains around 3 percent in Paris and Frankfurt and around 5 percent
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts ascribed BAT's surge to the end of uncertainty over the
spinoff of the financial services business. ``The market was just
waiting for tangible proof that the de-merger would take place,''
said Tim Young, an analyst with SG Securities. Shares in the
company's financial units, which have merged with the Zurich Group
to form Allied Zurich, closed down 30.5 pence at 7.86 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with the Zurich Group, investors in BAT
Industries split their old stock equally between British American
Tobacco PLC and Allied Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   BAT Industries went ahead with its asset sale including the
insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star after a British High Court
judge rejected efforts by 48 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health
plans in the United States last week to block the $18.7 billion
deal with the Zurich Group.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the health plans argued that the court should
protect BAT creditors in settlements intended to cover the cost of
treating people with smoking-related illnesses. But BAT maintained
that it was not possible to forecast the outcome of future
litigation. Lord Justice David Neuberger ruled in favor of BAT
Industries, which suspended trading in its stock on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   British American Tobacco, which makes Lucky Strike cigarettes,
is the world's second-largest cigarette producer after Philip
Morris. Its principal unit in the United States is Brown &AMP;
Williamson, a wholly owned subsidiary that has been a defendant in
litigation in Florida, Texas and Mississippi. BAT ascribed falling
tobacco profit last year to settlement costs in the United States
of $431 million and rising American legal fees totaling $144
million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the parent company's direct exposure to American
litigation is limited, according to Prideaux, the spokesman,
because of what he called a ``pretty consistent track record in the
United States of courts' finding that the holding company was
outside their jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Any ramifications for American tobacco concerns that might
consider spinning off non-tobacco interests were thus uncertain.
``It was probably slightly easier for us to do because we are a
U.K.-based company,'' Prideaux said.

AMERICANS NEED MORE VITAMIN C, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 C-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Put down that coffee and pick up some orange
juice. A good chunk of Americans aren't getting enough vitamin C,
leaving them open to a host of health problems, according to an
Arizona State University researcher.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of people studied by ASU nutrition researcher
Carol Johnston were depleted of vitamin C, a condition that causes
fatigue and irritability, as well as worsens respiratory
infections. The worst conditions can develop into scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised Johnston, an associate professor of family
resources and human development, who has researched vitamin C since
the early 1980s. The patients didn't fit the typical profile:
``They were basically healthy and many of them were pregnant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's research is published this month in the ``Journal of
the American College of Nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston tested the blood of 494 patients at a Cigna HealthCare
of Arizona clinic and found that 30 percent of them were vitamin
C-depleted and 6.3 percent suffered from the more severe vitamin C
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's findings bolster the idea that people may be aware of
nutritional campaigns such as ``Five-A-Day'' but aren't following
them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of eating five servings of produce daily, most Americans
squeak by with one or two, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they meet their quota, they may not be biting into
foods rich in vitamin C. Bananas, apples, potatoes and lettuce,
America's favorite produce, aren't high in vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the B vitamins and folic acid, it's not easy to fortify
food with vitamin C since its potency is weakened when exposed to
heat and air, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days in a fridge, fruit and vegetables lose up to half
of their vitamin and mineral content. Oranges _ usually the big
kahuna of vitamin C _ can lose their potency if cut up for fruit
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston isn't against using supplements _ it's estimated that
43 percent of American households take supplements. But a glass of
orange juice would provide the daily requirements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements, established by the Food and Drug
Administration, are under fire from nutritionists and others who
argue they are too low.
</P>
<P>
   A federal study in 1996 suggested it should more than triple the
daily recommended levels of vitamin C to 200 milligrams from 60
milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston recently testified before a panel of the National
Academy of Sciences about the advantages of raising the level.
Current levels prevent scurvy, but higher levels of vitamin C could
minimize the effects of colds and encourage exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin's reputation took a hit in the late 1980s when Nobel
chemist Linus Pauling declared it as a treatment for everything
from colds to AIDS. Since then, it has lost luster in mainstream
medicine, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   But research continues to show that taking vitamin C at least
reduces the length of time people suffer from colds. Vitamin C
depletion is linked to higher blood levels of histamine, the stuff
that makes noses run and get stuffy; vitamin C is like nature's
antihistamine, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The word may still be out on the vitamin's role in defusing
colds, but its value at warding off scurvy is undisputed.
</P>
<P>
   Scurvy begins as a skin rash and swelling, but leads to joint
pain and bleeding gums.
</P>
<P>
   Although vitamin C levels in the blood are easy to test, few
physicians suspect it as they make their diagnoses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One physician, for example, thought a girl had polio but in
fact, she was low on vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   The case was a warning that scurvy isn't a thing of the past,
Johnston said. &QL;

DOW SLIDE MAY RENEW SOME VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Are you a person with vision?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have my sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly impossible these days to have vision, or to think
long term. Nobody's interested. The whole world wants results, and
they want them now, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a world of five-minute doctor visits, drive-through
restaurants and instant gratification. ``Long-term planning'' in
most companies means next week, not next year.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been rather interesting to watch the craziness
surrounding Internet start-up companies. Now here's an industry
where ``long term'' is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's making money yet, except, perhaps, Yahoo!. Yet
investors have flocked to such companies, flooding them with cash
on the expectation that there's money to be made down the road, as
millions of consumers begin using the new online medium.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be made. But it ain't happening yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Stock Index, for example, tracks about 50 top
Internet-related stocks. Two-thirds of the companies on the list
operate in the red or just break even.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wolff's new book, ``Burn Rate,'' details the absurdity
of it all, beginning with the title. ``Burn Rate,'' the former
journalist and entrepreneur points out, refers to the amount of
money a promising start-up company consumes each month in excess of
its income.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so bizarre that even the comic strip ``Doonesbury'' has
gotten into the act, making fun of Internet companies that operate
in the red, yet keep attracting millions of dollars in investment
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But is the tide turning?
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 31 market crash hit technology stocks hard.
Internet-related stocks took the brunt of it. Stock in Amazon.com,
a hugely successful online book seller, lost 21 percent of its
value Monday, and 4.5 percent more on Sept. 1. Yahoo! sank 17
percent Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such stocks may have made up their losses by the time you read
this, but many in the industry are wondering whether the honeymoon
is over. Could it be that investors have turned a corner, and from
now on will require a bit more in return for their cash?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't surprise me. After all, investing in the future
requires vision. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seniors page debuts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! has produced another one of its trademark specialty
areas. This time, the special area is devoted to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Yahoo! Senior's Guide, seniors.yahoo.com. (Note:
There is no ``www'' at the beginning of that Web address.)
</P>
<P>
   The site takes all the Web has to offer and filters it, leaving
only those resources that might be interesting to older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are familiar categories _ computers, entertainment,
travel, etc. . . . But when you click on them, you're treated to a
group of Web sites and other resources that apply to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Computers, for example, and you get subcategories
including links to other Web sites for seniors and links to topics
of interest to seniors, such as genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   There also are links to senior-oriented live chats and a host of
message boards on topics ranging from health care to personal
finance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, something funny &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owen Whetzel, a fine gentleman I once worked with in California,
keeps in occasional touch with me via e-mail. And I appreciate
that, too, as he often forwards humorous postings he runs across in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   His latest electronic dispatch began:
</P>
<P>
   ``If lawyers can be disbarred, and clergymen defrocked, doesn't
it follow that . . .
</P>
<P>
   - Electricians can be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   - Cowboys can be deranged
</P>
<P>
   - Models can be deposed
</P>
<P>
   - Organ donors can be delivered
</P>
<P>
   - Musicians can be denoted.
</P>
<P>
   - Bedmakers can be debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I guess so. Thanks for pointing that out, Owen! &QL;

A BALLOT WITHOUT A LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's primary election day in Arizona and, once again,
the so-called news media in our community has failed to provide us
with the facts we need to make informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the working press, I'm embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the voting public, I'm outraged.
</P>
<P>
   How are we supposed to differentiate between good politicians
and bad when all we know about the candidates are their party
affiliations, their qualifications and their positions on the
issues?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but didn't a single hack in this backwater burb think
to ask political hopefuls the basic ``who, what, when, where and
why'' questions?
</P>
<P>
   As in, Whom are you sleeping with?
</P>
<P>
   What exactly do you do?
</P>
<P>
   When do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we can guess why. But, as for the rest, how can we be
expected to make intelligent decisions about leadership without the
kind of vital information voters receive in cities like Washington,
D.C.?
</P>
<P>
   The candidates say they want to lower taxes. So? What voters
need to know is, did these people ever lie on their tax returns?
</P>
<P>
   Not once? Not on a single deduction? An inflated expense
account? A long shot that came in at the track?
</P>
<P>
   What about health care?
</P>
<P>
   Did any of the folks running for office ever call in ``sick'' on
a really nice day? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did the dog do it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's education.
</P>
<P>
   Have our political candidates ever told a teacher the dog ate
their homework?
</P>
<P>
   Did they ever tell a cop they really (begin ital) did (end ital)
come to a complete stop at the intersection? Or that it was their
``index'' finger being used to give directions to another driver?
</P>
<P>
   All political candidates say honesty is important. They all
promise to be truthful.
</P>
<P>
   But, would telephone solicitors agree?
</P>
<P>
   Were the politicians on the line really ``about to sit down for
dinner,'' ``in the middle of changing a diaper'' or ``hard of
hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   And was it true when they told the Jehovah's Witnesses at the
door, ``We don't speakie da English?''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with the reporters here?
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with voters?
</P>
<P>
   All politicians promise to take criminals off the streets,
reduce the number of government regulations and encourage business.
</P>
<P>
   What about (begin ital) their (end ital) business?
</P>
<P>
   Do they eat their broccoli?
</P>
<P>
   Do they drink right out of the milk carton?
</P>
<P>
   Do they brush between meals?
</P>
<P>
   Do they leave the toilet seat up?
</P>
<P>
   Do they cry at Hallmark commercials? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Important questions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the national news and read big-city papers. These
things are important. They must be.
</P>
<P>
   Have any of the candidates ever watched ``Jerry Springer''?
</P>
<P>
   Appeared on ``Jerry Springer''?
</P>
<P>
   Invested in an Arkansas real estate deal with Jerry Springer?
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arizona, voters simply haven't been presented with the
kind of data citizens in the rest of the United States seem to
consider essential.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Like when one candidate for state attorney general produced a TV
commercial calling another candidate a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Or when a third attorney general candidate went out of her way
to say she is not gay.
</P>
<P>
   But, why aren't reporters asking what would seem to be the
obvious follow-up questions?
</P>
<P>
   Do they dye their hair?
</P>
<P>
   Do they cheat at solitaire?
</P>
<P>
   Have they ever torn the tab from a mattress or pillow?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what's wrong with us _ lack of savoir-faire, maybe
_ but not a single candidate in our state has been asked to respond
to the one-word inquiry that seems to preoccupy voters everywhere
else:
</P>
<P>
   Intern? &QL;

MARKET'S `PAUSE' REFRESHING TO ANALYST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The recent stock market plunge has been called a lot
of things, some of which can't be printed in a family newspaper.
But Peter Lynch views this summer's decline as a ``pause that
refreshes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, the famed former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund in
Boston, said he was hoping earlier this year for the market to
tread water for a while so that corporate profit growth could catch
up to investors' high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Profit growth, after all, is the main determinant of stock
market performance over the long haul, Lynch said. Yet prices
during 1998's first half vaulted much more dramatically than
earnings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rooting for the market not to go up as much so that
earnings could catch up,'' he said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he wouldn't mind seeing the Dow Jones industrial
average hover between 7,500 and 8,000 for a year or two. The Dow
started 1998 near 7,900 but has dropped below that during the
recent retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, stocks tend to rise roughly in line with profit
growth, Lynch said. From 1945 through 1997, the market advanced
sixtyfold, compared to a fiftyfourfold increase for corporate
profits. But during the first half of 1998, it surged 18 percent
while earnings were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (gap) can't last for very long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch advises people to take market slides in stride as a normal
part of the investment cycle. Since 1970, for instance, stocks have
dropped 10 percent or more on 13 occasions _ about once every two
years. Such declines can't be predicted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is spearheading a new Fidelity drive to encourage
investors to gain a better understanding of what they own. He
recently wrote a pamphlet, ``Key Things Every Investor Should
Know,'' that offers tips and a quiz for figuring out the stock
market and related investment topics. The pamphlet is available for
free by calling 800-544-8888.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his message, Lynch also will appear in Fidelity
television commercials with actress Lily Tomlin starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin will help ``cut through the clutter and deliver what we
think investors need: Peter Lynch's timeless, invaluable principles
of investing,'' said Stephen Cone, president of a Fidelity
marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who is vice chairman of Fidelity's money-management arm
and a trustee for the group's mutual funds, also thinks market
drops are good opportunities for investors to learn a bit more
about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch cautioned investors to anticipate more modest returns from
stocks in the years ahead compared with what they've seen in the
recent past. Corporate profits have grown at roughly an 8 percent
annual clip since 1945 and aren't likely to deviate much from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even at 8 percent a year, you get very powerful
compounding,'' Lynch said. ``At that rate, your money will double
every nine years.'' &QL;

LIFE (WITH MARIS AROUND) WAS NOT FAIR

   FARGO, N.D. _ We sat as strangers, sharing space and watching TV
because Mark McGwire might hit a baseball beyond the confines of
Busch Stadium. My companions were all young people who cheered
every time the St. Louis first baseman came to the plate in the
hope that he'd hear them and knock one out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Although I wished McGwire well, I did not share the enthusiasm
of my temporary associates. Every time McGwire hits a home run, it
diminishes my personal claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   This goes back to the summer of 1950, when I played baseball
against Roger Maris. I was considerably younger then, and the
passing years have clouded my memory somewhat, but there are things
that stick with you forever.
</P>
<P>
   And Roger Maris was one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Fargo American Legion team; I played for
Jamestown, 100 miles to the west. We faced each other twice that
summer. His team won both games by lopsided scores and eventually
went on to capture the state championship.
</P>
<P>
   He was Roger Maras then, (I'll explain that later), a
15-year-old who commanded so much respect that we put on the Maras
Shift every time he came to the plate. He batted left-handed, so in
what we considered a clever display in skill and cunning, we moved
all our infielders and outfielders to the right side of the
diamond, so we could catch the ball when he hit it toward us.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, however, it was a case of seven players putting
up a brave front while secretly hoping that if he did whack the
ball it would go toward someone else. Even at that tender age,
Maras hit line shots that would have drilled a hole right through
us if we were dumb enough to get in front of one. And we'd be left
standing there with a big cavity in our chest and feeling as stupid
as Wile E. Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. We loved baseball,
but none of us was so enamored with the game that we were willing
to sacrifice our bodies for an out, even if it was against Roger
Maras.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was a futile gesture anyway _ we never got him out. He
hit the ball and our infielders ducked, then hollered instructions
to our second line of defense _ the outfielders. A small band of
hearty souls, we had positioned ourselves against the outfield
fences so we could see the ball as it sped toward us. This reduced
the possibility of getting hit on the back of the head by a line
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it wasn't Roger Maras who was supposed to be doing
this to us. His brother, Rudy, was the original reason for the
Maras Shift because we had played against him the previous year and
he had been very unkind to our pitching staff. But now we also had
to deal with his brother, who was just as talented, even though he
was only 15. It was one of our first exposures to the theory that
life is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   So we played the two games against Fargo, got creamed by what
seemed like a total of 50 runs, and tried to put it all behind us
by joking that we'd been beaten by worse teams, which was true. We
finished the season with a 4-16 record. Roger Maras was selected as
the most valuable player for the Fargo team after it won the state
title. The honor came shortly before his 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   I graduated from the American Legion program after that season,
but Roger continued his assault on our family for another year. In
the summer of 1951, my brother Jim pitched against him in a game in
Jamestown. They faced each other four times. My brother struck him
out in their first three encounters, something that still comes up
regularly at family reunions. But on his fourth trip to the plate,
Maras hit the ball so hard that those who witnessed it swear it was
still climbing when it cleared the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   They never found the ball. The assumption was that it landed in
the river across the road from the ballpark. That meant it was
airborne for about 400 feet. Understandably, this is still not a
popular discussion topic when our family convenes.
</P>
<P>
   I saw him in person only once more, in 1953. He was 19, playing
with the Fargo-Moorhead Twins, a Cleveland Indians farm team in the
Class C Northern League. His brother and I were teammates on the
North Dakota State Baseball Squad, and Rudy got us free tickets to
the Twins games. One night I yelled at Roger as he ran in from the
outfield. Without breaking stride he waved and said, ``Hey,
Jamestown.'' The gesture not only eased some of the grief he had
caused me and my family, but also elevated my stature in the eyes
of my classmates. ``You know him?'' they asked. ``Yup,'' I replied.
``Played against him a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time I ever uttered the phrase, and it earned
me so much respect that it has been a standard in my conversational
English since then.
</P>
<P>
   Maras played 114 games with the Twins that summer, hitting .325
with nine homers and earning the league's Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the spelling occurred in 1955, said Sid Cichyi,
who coached the brothers when they attended Shanley High School in
Fargo. ``Roger was playing with Keokuk, Iowa, and some of the fans
began taunting him by emphasizing the last syllable of his name,''
Cichyi said. ``This upset his dad so much that he had the family
name legally changed to Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Both spellings appear in the Maris memorabilia on display at the
Roger Maris museum, located in the West Acres shopping mall in
Fargo. The museum, actually a large glass enclosure in one of the
walkways, tracks Maris' baseball career from his American Legion
days until he retired in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   A steady trickle of fans stopped to look and comment Saturday.
``He had such a sweet swing,'' said Bev Grande of Fargo, who
watched him many years ago. ``I hate to see his record broken,
because it means something to me personally. But at least the
attention is getting him some favorable publicity. When he was
chasing Babe Ruth's record, the sportswriters didn't like him,
because Ruth was such a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man who refused to give his name was more emphatic.
``I'd like to break McGwire's kneecap,'' he growled. ``Now
everybody will forget about Maris, and he was a great ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude was different in the watering hole where dozens of
us watched McGwire's pursuit of the home run record over the
weekend. Whenever McGwire came to bat, everyone cheered except me.
And when he hit No. 60 on Saturday, a few of the younger people
showed unrestrained exuberance. I questioned this show of
non-support for the hometown hero who is immortalized a couple of
miles south of where we sat and buried just a few miles north.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Lewis, 27, gave me a plausible explanation. ``The older
people don't want the record broken because they associate with
Maris,'' he said. ``But he had his time. McGwire is our generation.
Let him have his glory now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I guess that makes me old. And I realized that I've also
been rather selfish in this matter. For 37 years, I have been using
my playing time against Roger Maris as one of those little
eyebrow-lifters tossed into a conversation to get attention. But my
position as a minor sports celebrity is on shaky ground and will
diminish now that McGwire tied Maris with his 61st home run, then
surpasses it with his 62nd. I firmly believe he will do it. And
that will reduce my bragging rights to a mere whisper of what they
used to be. It will still be important to me, but overall, my niche
in sports history just got a lot smaller.
</P>
<P>
   I don't climb down from my self-constructed pedestal willingly,
however. Even as I write this, I am thinking about Darin Erstad, a
rising star with the Anaheim Angels. He's from Jamestown. There's
got to be some tie-in between me and him . . . &QL;

MURDOCH MOVE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED UNSETTLES BRITISH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Given that most British people think baseball is an
unfathomable American bastardization of cricket, few here batted an
eye last year when media mogul Rupert Murdoch bought the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Australian-born tycoon has set his sights on
Manchester United, England's most famous and financially successful
soccer team, all hell has broken loose. It is suddenly the biggest
story in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things that arouse the passions of the English
like soccer, or what they call football. But one thing that comes
close is anything that the ambitious, controversial tycoon touches.
Put together, soccer and Murdoch are a volatile mix, politically
and culturally, in England and the rest of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Murdoch's BSkyB cable network confirmed that it was
trying to buy venerable Man United, an announcement that sent the
team's stock value soaring about $190 million in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged fans plan to picket at Wednesday night's game at Old
Trafford, Man United's hallowed stadium. They are convinced that
Murdoch wants to corner the television market on the team, making
its games exclusive to his cable network, which already has a
virtual monopoly on Premier League games. As Sky prepares to launch
a 200-channel digital network, landing the games of the New York
Yankees of English soccer would be an enticing lure for potential
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's initial offer of about $900 million for the team has
spawned interest from other corporations, including Enic, an
entertainment conglomerate which has financial backing from the US
giant Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Man United fans who are lamenting the bidding war
that Murdoch has started. Fans of the 19 other Premier League clubs
fear that if Murdoch acquires the team, his network will show Man
United games at the exclusion of others.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer fans here take their game seriously, and consider it
beneath the purely bottom-line thinking that dominates most
professional sports in the rest of Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing fear that soccer, one of the few things that
provides common ground for all classes and races in a society often
divided by class and race, will become just another commodity to be
bought and sold by the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in his shop in North London, Nick Marcos, an elderly
tailor, shrugged as he bemoaned the growing commercialization of a
game he played as a child in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money today,'' he said. ``The game has become
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the threat that Murdoch's sudden interest in Man United
poses to English football, it refocuses attention on the
relationship between Murdoch and British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
whose government must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since his May 1997 landslide election, Blair has enjoyed an
extended honeymoon with the press, especially Murdoch's holdings.
But Blair's alleged coziness with Murdoch continues to surface as a
sore point, a welcome development for political opponents who have
little else to beat him up with.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of that, Blair's closest adviser, Peter Mandelson, the
trade and industry secretary who can approve or veto the deal,
swiftly announced that Murdoch's bid would be given intense
scrutiny to make sure it does not pose an undue threat to
consumers. Fans are not reassured by Mandelson's close friendship
with Murdoch's daughter, Elisabeth, Sky's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say there is probably little the government can do to
stop Murdoch from buying Man United, but politically it must be
seen to be doing all it can to stop him. If the government blocks
Murdoch, it will score points with fans everywhere but risk
incurring the wrath of Murdoch's extensive media empire.
</P>
<P>
   All this bother over a soccer team leaves some people puzzled.
As London's Evening Standard observed in an editorial, ``It says
much about national priorities that there has been far more public
anguish about Mr. Rupert Murdoch's threatened bid for Manchester
United than ever there was about the creation of his dominant media
empire in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch controls about 40 percent of the British media, from
racy tabloids that showcase naked women to the more upmarket
broadsheet, The Times of London. If he succeeds in his latest
acquisition bid, he will own just one soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   But, for millions of people, it's the only team that matters.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Old farm joke: What happens when you bet the
farm and lose? Answer: You just make another enemy. Otto Wagner
Jr., 43, who farms 3,600 acres in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
retells the joke. But, frankly, there's little laughter in his
region, or in other parts of Texas, where the Drought of '98
lingers. The drought came as the great leveler this year. Many
farmers are on the brink of failure, agricultural economists warn.
And August's rains in some parts of the state came too late to do
much good for this year's crops. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram
recently visited farmers in three regions _ Ellis County south of
Dallas, Gaines and Dawson counties in Northwest Texas, and the
Lower Rio Grande Valley _ for a closer look at the drought's
impact. Some said they were considering leaving the business.

   TOLAR, Texas _ From behind the closed gate of the Lawhon Exotic
Ranch, officials say, the tentacles of a theft ring reached out to
five states, to Costa Rica, and even to a deceased witness in the
Whitewater investigation. Now there are only metal barns, some emus
and the occasional donkey on a well-kept patch of land just outside
Tolar. But this year authorities discovered a huge collection of
stolen vehicles _ pickups, front-end loaders and earth-moving
machines _ on the property. The Department of Public Safety says it
was the most expensive collection of stolen vehicles it has
uncovered. Since January, when the ranch's owner, Charles W.
Lawhon, 48, was accused of stealing a Johnson County earthmover,
authorities have found more than 120 stolen vehicles valued at more
than $3 million. They were scattered across Arkansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Minnesota and North Dakota, and the DPS says that some
vehicles may even have been shipped to Costa Rica. By BILL HANNA.

DON'T TAKE RISKS IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the turmoil in the stock market last week, a
colleague made an interesting remark to me about risk.
</P>
<P>
   We always talk about people selling stocks when the market
drops, but who buys those shares and why are they so willing to buy
when the market looks so risky?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is lower stock prices, but that's not all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been said in the aftermath of the market's carnage
about whether you'd be nuts to buy into stocks now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big believer in buying on the dips, but I also believe you
need to put risk in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the stocks of some high-quality companies
have fallen to tempting prices. But the reward for picking up these
battered stocks will only go to the patient. Unless you're able to
part with your money for as long as five years, you shouldn't be in
stocks, especially now, when the market's so volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If investors are going in with the idea of trying to make some
money on the short term, they may or may not win because of that,''
said Henry Lartigue, chief investment officer of Chase Bank of
Texas. ``Market movements over the short term tend to be random,
but over the long term, the stock market rises.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you're a long-term investor, you may be running just
as much risk being out of the market now as you would going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the market shows over time, those who bought on
dips were rewarded at some point in the future,'' said David Lapin,
president of Lapin &AMP; Wigginton Asset Management in Houston, a money
management firm.
</P>
<P>
   With stock prices as low as they are, you actually would be
taking on less risk if you buy in now because stock prices have
fallen so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's market turmoil brought stock prices down about 20
percent off their 52-week highs, Lartigue said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't shop for a stock just on the basis of how far it has
fallen. It's not a bargain unless the company also has good
management and the likelihood for steady earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are buying a good-quality company and your intention is
to hold it for the long term, then I don't think you're assuming
too much risk,'' said Lynn Bernard Jr., executive vice president of
global investment strategies at Pinnacle Management &AMP; Trust in
Houston, money managers. ``Over the long term, there are plenty of
companies that you could argue could do quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you buy in up or down markets, there's no avoiding risk.
But you can take steps to limit the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   First, ask yourself what's the potential return on an investment
vs. the potential loss. Look at the price/earnings ratio of the
stock, which is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay
for a company's earning power.
</P>
<P>
   How does the ratio compare with that of the overall market and
the price/earnings ratios of other companies in the industry? Is it
too high or too low relative to the company's earnings?
</P>
<P>
   If you find a stock you like, take it in small bites. Don't bank
your entire retirement nest egg on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should buy stocks in unemotional quantities,'' said money
manager Richard J. Fruth of Richard J. Fruth &AMP; Associates. ``Buy
small amounts and if it goes lower, you can add to it. This is not
an all-or-nothing business. You don't go from zero-invested to
fully invested.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread your money among different types of investments because
diversification will save you in a down market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the recent market shakeout saw the stocks of
Houston companies getting hit harder and sooner than the rest of
the market because of the city's heavy concentration of energy
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification doesn't mean going to the other extreme. You
could be asking for trouble if you bail out of stocks in favor of
cash investments.
</P>
<P>
   Certificates of deposits and savings accounts may shelter you
from day-to-day fluctuations, but can't protect your spending power
from the ravages of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you have too much money invested in stocks,
gradually reduce your stock holdings and move your money into less
risky investments such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, trust your gut. You ultimately are the best person to
gauge how much risk you're comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things start to decline _ there are bad headlines in the
papers and on television _ will you have the stomach for the market
volatility and the broad-based pessimism that tends to come with
it?'' Peter Lynch, Fidelity Investments' famed money manager, asked
in a new education campaign aimed at investors.
</P>
<P>

BEATRICE'S DISAPPEARING ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, you couldn't turn on the TV without seeing a
``We're Beatrice'' commercial. I haven't seen one in years. Did the
company fold?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.F.F., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``We're Beatrice'' campaign was the brainchild of former
chief executive James Dutt, who wanted to identify the company's
diverse consumer and food products more strongly with the Beatrice
name.
</P>
<P>
   After Dutt was forced to resign in 1985, the Chicago company was
taken private in an $8.2 billion leveraged buyout. The new owners
immediately launched an effort to pay debts by selling off Beatrice
holdings, including Avis, Playtex and Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's nonfood.MDNM/ operations were reorganized
as a new company, E-II Holdings, which was later sold to American
Brands.
</P>
<P>
   After the buyout, the huge promotional campaign was not resumed
and the Beatrice logo was removed from company products. In 1986,
then-chief executive Donald Kelly told Fortune what the new slogan
should be: ```We're Beatrice, now you'll have to find us.''' The
last Beatrice holdings were sold to ConAgra in 1990 for $1.36
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a big fan of ``Good Will Hunting'' star Minnie Driver.
Where can I contact her?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.K., Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Amelia ``Minnie'' Driver can be contacted in care of Creative
Artists Agency, 9830 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Driver, 27, is a 1991 graduate of the Webber-Douglas Academy of
Dramatic Art in London. As she built a career on British
television, Driver made ends meet by performing as a jazz vocalist
and guitarist at London clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance for many U.S. moviegoers to see her was the
1995 film ``Circle of Friends.'' She was nominated for a Best
Supporting Actress Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Driver has been promoting ``The Governess,'' a
historical drama set in 1840s London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Barbara Bel Geddes using her real name? Also, where was
she born and raised?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.T.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The longtime ``Dallas'' star was born on Oct. 31, 1922, in
New York. Her father, Norman Bel Geddes, was a stage and industrial
designer who used a professional name slightly different from his
birth name _ Norman Melancton Geddes.
</P>
<P>
   Bel Geddes, who missed one season of ``Dallas'' because of
health problems, has been retired since the series went off the air
in 1990. Fans can write to her in care of Shapira and Associates,
15301 Ventura Blvd., Suite 345, Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.

A PRODIGY MURDERED IN HIS PRIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing leads to another. We were talking about movies
generally, then movie stars in particular, and finally Debbie
Reynolds specifically. Reference was made to the song ``Tammy,''
which a very young Debbie recorded quite successfully after
appearing opposite a very young Peter Fonda in ``Tammy and the
Bachelor'' so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   One thing leads to another. Wasn't that movie based on a popular
novel? Indeed it was, and I offered the information that the novel
title was ``Tammy Out of Time'' and that the author, a woman named
Cyd Ricketts Sumner, was the victim in an unsolved murder.
</P>
<P>
   One thing leads to another. We talked about authors known to
have been murdered, or believed to have been murdered in cases of
official suicides. That enabled me to talk about David Graham
Phillips, author of the great novel ``Susan Lenox, Her Fall and
Rise,'' of which I may have more to say soon, in print. Then
someone _ indeed, a professor _ mentioned a name I had almost
forgotten completely; and I really was surprised to hear the name
of Paul Leicester Ford from someone else's lips.
</P>
<P>
   Back there in high school English, junior year, we read two
historical novels, both published around the century's turn. One
was set in a Missouri embattled and divided during the Civil War
period. Its author was Winston Churchill _ the ``other'' one, an
American of reliable bestsellerdom well before his distant British
cousin attained a higher glory.
</P>
<P>
   The other work was ``Janice Meredith,'' an often pulsating
narrative of the American Revolution. Its author was Paul Leicester
Ford, of whom I then knew nothing; nor, I believe, did the teacher,
although she certainly knew about Churchill and rated him the
better author. She was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some years later, I learned some things about Paul Leicester
Ford that to me were quite interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In historical scholarship, Paul Ford was a child prodigy almost
as amazing as little Amadeus Mozart in music. He was well-born, and
his father was a literatus with an extensive private library that
was exploited by the boy's precociousness.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, at age 8, was author of a patriotic essay addressed to an
adult readership, printed in a newspaper. At age 10, he undertook
what he said would be his life's work, that of collecting and
editing for posterity many historical accounts that were sliding
into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   His heroes were Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. From
1892 to 1894, Ford issued incrementally in 10 volumes ``The
Writings of Thomas Jefferson,'' still recognized as authoritative
and the basis for the Jefferson volume in the Library of America
series.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ford yielded to that well-known agent, popular demand, and
became a historical novelist. ``The Honorable Peter Stirling''
appeared in 1895, when he was 29, and made him famous. In 1896 he
was a sales leader in nonfiction, as his ``The True George
Washington'' humanized an almost mythical Washington, presenting
his flaws without diminishing his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Ford labored several years on the manuscript of ``Janice
Meredith,'' ultimately the popular sensation of 1899. It brought
the American historical novel into heady vogue. Mary Johnston's
``To Have and to Hold'' was the nation's top seller in 1900, as was
Churchill's ``The Crisis'' in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, ``Janice Meredith'' remains the
definitive novel of the American Revolution. Walter Edmonds'
``Drums Along the Mohawk'' and some of Kenneth Roberts' works
surely are better; but they deal with fragments of the Revolution,
where Ford did the whole number _ Paul Revere's ride; the Boston
Tea Party; Patrick Henry's impassioned address to the Virginia
House of Burgesses; the winter at Valley Forge; Washington crossing
the Delaware; the battles of Yorktown, Lexington and Saratoga; and
the surrender of Cornwallis. Washington and Jefferson are major
characters in the novel.
</P>
<P>
   A heroine was needed, and Janice Meredith was Ford's entirely
fictional creation; but his historical fidelity gave the narrative
great validity. It's easy to believe that the novel would still be
famous today, as likely also would other historical novels Ford
might have written, if ...
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't been murdered. As a shining success in life and
literature, Paul Leicester Ford inherited his father's considerable
estate. His older brother, Malcolm, a dissolute failure, was
disinherited. The jealous Malcolm shot and killed his brother in
1902 when Paul Ford was only 36.
</P>
<P>
   Talk swung back to movies when someone suggested that ``Janice
Meredith'' might be an apt property for one. Well, it ``was''
filmed, rather elaborately, back in the silent era as a Marion
Davies vehicle. Sure enough, it marked the feature-film debut of
W.C. Fields, in a comical cameo as a British soldier.
</P>
<P>
   That got us talking about William Claude Fields, and Robert
Lewis Taylor's book about him, and Rod Steiger's portrayal ... one
thing leads to another.

ADVENTURES, ALL IN A ROW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of us in New York complain yearly about pandering repertory
and incoherent programs, but solutions are arriving from every
side. I hope the public responds, because music this season is
being served with a sense of adventure unusual to the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The watchword is ``series,'' and there are a lot of them:
coherent looks at either individuals or ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A series from Great Performers at Lincoln Center asks whether
important music should be seen as well as heard. Peter Sellars
stages Bach cantatas sung by Lorraine Hunt in March. Theatrical
treatment is also given to Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lunaire'' (John
Kelly, Sarah Rothenberg and colleagues) in January and Mahler's
``Kindertotenlieder'' (Robert Lepage and Rebecca Blankenship) in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Jessye Norman and Bill T. Jones have a similar project in May,
and the Brooklyn Academy of Music chimes in with Schubert's
``Winterreise'' as dramatized by Jurgen Tamchina in November.
Should we just listen? Should stage people leave well enough alone?
We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Great Performers come six Elgar events in January,
four of which bravely pair the composer with Beethoven. Colin Davis
conducts the London Symphony Orchestra in three of the programs at
Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Although we must wade through another Beethoven cycle at the New
York Philharmonic this fall (something neither an already lazy
public nor Beethoven needs), there are signs of life at this
cautious and conservative institution. A composer-as-theme event
remembers Gershwin's centennial in December, with the pianist Andre
Previn moving between the concert Gershwin and his jazz
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Sofia Gubaidulina will come and stay as well, her weeklong
residence in the spring offering a newly commissioned concerto for
two violas.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Haydn is getting the attention he deserves. The
Orchestra of St. Luke's explores symphonic and operatic repertory
in three concerts led by Franz Bruggen, Charles Mackerras and Roger
Norrington. St. Lukes's chamber players add three more concerts of
their own. Haydn is best heard surrounded by more Haydn, not as an
isolated throat-clearer in mixed programs.
</P>
<P>
   Four Cleveland Orchestra concerts at Carnegie Hall in May
constitute a double theme: Debussy and Ravel (led by Pierre
Boulez), and Mahler (led by Christoph von Dohnanyi). Here are
sustained looks by a great orchestra and two great conductors well
suited to the repertories.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century ends, a better idea of the period in
retrospect is now with us, and interesting examples arrive this
season from every side. Bernd Alois Zimmermann's ``Requiem for a
Young Poet'' crosses the Atlantic for the first time, when Michael
Gielen conducts the Southwest Radio Symphony Orchestra of Freiburg
at Carnegie Hall in April.
</P>
<P>
   Operas like Thomas Ades's ``Powder Her Face'' (the Brooklyn
Philharmonic), ``Moses und Aron'' and ``Wozzeck'' (the Metropolitan
Opera) and Astor Piazzolla's ``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' Steve
Reich's ``Hindenburg'' and the Philip Glass-Robert Wilson
``Monsters of Grace'' (all at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) offer
substance and variety.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Carter will be everywhere this season. James Levine and
the Met Chamber Ensemble look at 20th-century Central Europe in
three Carnegie Hall concerts of unusual richness: Ligeti,
Schoenberg, Poulenc, Berg and Webern. Note, too, the Met
Orchestra's premiere of Milton Babbitt's Piano Concerto No. 2 with
Robert Taub.
</P>
<P>
   Another series of note has a man as a theme, and he will be
doing nearly everything but selling tickets. In the spring at
Carnegie Hall, Alfred Brendel appears as recitalist, concerto
soloist, accompanist, chamber player and poet. (Brendel will read
his own work at Weill Recital Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   It all looks too good to be true: Schoenberg and Berg in the
same Met season, the return of Reich's ``Music for 18 Musicians''
in the Brooklyn program, the rare look at Zimmermann's big vocal
piece, the proffering of styles as varied as Piazzolla and
Gubaidulina. There is much to look forward to.

FROM A FAMILY OF PAINTERS, A QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   Justine Elias writes about theater, television and film from New
York.  
(bl) 
 By JUSTINE ELIAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Few actors, however successful, can say that they
have a museum in the family, but Alessandro Nivola can boast of
two: one, devoted to his grandfather, Italian sculptor Constantino
Nivola, is situated in the artist's hometown in Sardinia, and a
second, a far more modest and decidedly unofficial archive in
Manhattan, is devoted to the actor himself.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Nivola, then a rising Broadway performer who had
done a few small film and television roles, landed the part of
Nicolas Cage's villainous younger brother and partner in crime in
the thriller ``Face/Off.'' Packing only a single suitcase, the
actor traveled to Los Angeles, expecting to work a few months and
then return to New York. But while he was on the West Coast, he was
evicted from his Greenwich Village apartment, and had to ask
friends to retrieve his belongings before they were tossed into the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a bin in Manhattan Mini Storage with my former life in
it, everything that was once me,'' said Nivola, 26. He added
mischievously, ``I hope my old landlord reads this and feels very
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the actor decided then to find a new home in Los
Angeles, and earned rave reviews for his performance as the
eccentric, anti-social bomb maker in ``Face/Off,'' his career has
not followed a conventional Hollywood path.
</P>
<P>
   In his next movie, ``Best Laid Plans,'' a drama starring Reese
Witherspoon and Josh Brolin that is to be released next spring, he
plays a graduate student turned con artist, and in ``I Want You,''
a forthcoming British film by Michael Winterbottom that is set in
the seaside town of Hastings, Nivola plays a paroled murderer
seeking to rekindle a forbidden love affair _ a role he researched
by spending three days in Brixton prison in South London.
</P>
<P>
   Winterbottom said the actor's regional British working-class
accent and manner became so convincing that members of the film's
crew were later startled to hear him speak in his normal voice.
They knew all along, objectively, that he was American, said the
director, but he's the kind of actor who can become completely
hidden in a role.
</P>
<P>
   Nivola's former co-star Cage, who has seen ``I Want You,''
agreed. ``Alessandro's a chameleon,'' said Cage, who added that he
was amused and inspired by his colleague's ideas as they created
their twisted, symbiotic screen relationship in ``Face/Off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nivola's facility with accents is coming in handy in his next
movie, a new adaptation of Jane Austen's ``Mansfield Park,'' now
filming in Britain. He plays the aristocratic Henry Crawford, whom
the actor describes as one of Austen's ``more ambiguous cads.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nivola, who was born in Boston and reared in several
Northeastern college towns, this international career has been a
welcome surprise. Though he grew up in a family of visual artists _
his mother, a grandmother, an aunt and younger brother are all
painters _ he became interested in performing at an early age, and
asked to be enrolled in summer drama courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a mimic, an imitator, and like my father, who is a
university professor, the only non-artist in the family,'' he said.
``I was always doing impressions of people. Later, I did lots of
tortured monologues where I had to cry, dredging up whatever tragic
history I could think of at age 12.''
</P>
<P>
   As an English literature student at Yale University, Nivola
worked in regional theater, even skipping a few weeks of classes to
perform in a Seattle production of an Athol Fugard play. Though
Nivola longed to try out for film and television roles, his first
agent advised him to wait. The strategy paid off when Nivola won a
key role in the 1995 Roundabout Theater production of Turgenev's
``Month in the Country,'' starring Helen Mirren.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has already tackled an impressive range of roles,
Nivola still contends with a certain degree of misapprehension
about who he really is. ``Early on in New York, because of my name,
I was constantly being called in to audition for roles as
bricklayers,'' said the actor, who resembles a Northern Italian
version of James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after `Face/Off,' people knew me as this strange fellow I
played. My agents would submit my name and people would say, `Well,
isn't he _ I mean, he's like Rain Man!' I went through a period
where I had to meet everyone in town, look them in the eye and show
them that I am a functional human being. Now, though, I think
people can alter that first impression.''

</P>
<P>
   The A, of course, stands for androgynous, which is one quality _
an infectious smile and raw talent are others _ that has the
21-year-old Irishman leading the latest Anglo-Irish thespian wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny's fabulous to look at,'' said Ang Lee, who cast Rhys
Meyers as a long-haired villain-with-a-difference in his Civil War
film, ``Ride With the Devil,'' which is expected to be released in
the spring, co-starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. ``Personally, I
feel he has a poetic quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Todd Haynes, who picked Rhys Meyers to play the
vaguely David Bowie-esque glam rocker Brian Slade in ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' which is to open Nov. 6, said: ``We had to have a
beautiful man who could be very skinny and strike an impressive and
arresting pose. To convey a viable rock-and-roll icon in a
fictional film is a really difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhys Meyers, for his part, takes a pragmatic view of his appeal.
``The way I look is the way I look,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's too smart not to be rather more self-aware. ``I've got
an androgyny anyway _ I've always had a very, very strong male
side,'' continued the actor, who was 2{ when his father left their
home in County Cork, Ireland, leaving his mother and brothers to
cope. ``Because I grew up with a single parent, I equally have a
strong feminine side, and I'm not afraid to let that come out. I'm
hoping I'll get some of the emotional intelligence that comes from
having a female side. I find that very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Velvet Goldmine,'' Rhys Meyers' enigmatic Slade makes his
way through 11 wigs and 17 makeup changes to capture the melancholy
heart of a film that, for all its apparent glitter, is as much a
requiem for an era as a celebration of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for somebody to wear all those different
haircuts and look well in every one of them,'' said Rhys Meyers.
(The costumes, which include leopard-print trousers and sparkly
platform boots, heighten the effect.) ``That was the challenge: was
I willing to let vanity take second place to courage? I decided I'd
take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar impulse prompted him to accept the part of Henry
Cavendish, the increasingly anxious suitor to Minnie Driver's
closeted Jew in ``The Governess,'' directed by Sandra Goldbacher,
which was released this summer. ``I thought, a really subdued 1840s
Victorian piece _ oh wow, let's go whip myself,'' he said. ``And I
get constantly rejected!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rhys Meyers is in near-constant demand, with films awaiting
release from, among others, Michael Radford (``B. Monkey'') and
Mike Figgis (``The Loss of Sexual Innocence''). Also unseen in the
United States is his first major role, filmed when he was 18, in
Sue Clayton's ``Disappearance of Finbar,'' an eccentric Irish
comedy in which he plays the errant lad of the title, who falls in
with a snowbound community of tango-obsessed Finns.
</P>
<P>
   With fame comes the inevitable comparisons, most often to
Leonardo DiCaprio, whom Rhys Meyers somewhat resembles, though with
a poutier, fuller-lipped effect. ``But,'' said Rhys Meyers, ``when
Daniel Day-Lewis first started acting, nobody said he was the new
anything. What I'd like is to be a Johnny Rhys Meyers. I'd like to
be accepted as myself.''

CAMBODIAN TROOPS DESTROY TENT CITY, ROUT PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Without warning Cambodian troops ripped
down a two-week-old protest campsite just after noon Tuesday and
spent the rest of the day chasing stone-throwing mobs through the
streets, flailing at them with sticks and firing automatic weapons
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people were injured, but no deaths or gunshot wounds
were reported, although officers said their troops were firing live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the tent city, which had become home to
hundreds of people who were supporting the losers in a
parliamentary election in July, appeared to break an agreement
reached hours earlier that would have produced a peaceful end to
the sit-in.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by the incumbent strongman and official
winner of the election, Hun Sen, had also promised that the leader
of the protest, Sam Rainsy, would not be arrested. But Sam Rainsy
remained under the protection of the United Nations in the
Cambodiana Hotel, where he prepared to spend a second night Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After two hand grenades exploded at his residence early Monday,
Hun Sen ordered the arrest of his opponents and barred them from
leaving the country. But the arrest order was later delayed. One
person was killed and several others were wounded on Monday when
soldiers fired into crowds outside the Cambodiana.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen made no official statement Tuesday, and there was a
sense of anarchy in the streets of the capital six weeks after an
election that had been intended to cement a frail democracy and
bring new stability.
</P>
<P>
   The scene included shooting, beating, running and shouting from
one street to the next as packs of young men with motorbikes
taunted soldiers and families leaned from balconies to watch. But
there was no clear aim to the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam Rainsy and the royalist party leader, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, have raised hundreds of complaints about fraud
and intimidation, most assessments by foreign and Cambodian
political analysts agree that such irregularities were probably not
enough to have changed the overall outcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The anger that was evident in the streets Tuesday, both among
demonstrators and security forces, appeared to be less a reflection
of electoral loyalties than of the frustrations and brutalities and
poverty brought on by unending violence and political feuding.
</P>
<P>
   There was hatred in the eyes of the young man who pulled his
T-shirt up to his neck and dared soldiers to shoot him, and there
was hatred in the eyes of the soldiers who chased him, brandishing
iron bars and sticks with nails in them.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was at its hottest and people were dozing on straw mats
after a midday meal when 100 soldiers and riot police officers with
helmets, plastic shields and electric-shock batons advanced into
the campsite that Sam Rainsy called Democracy Square.
</P>
<P>
   The troops shot in the air, and a fire truck turned a high-power
hose on the blue plastic lean-tos. Whacking at the squatters with
the rifle butts and kicking over cooking pots, the soldiers drove
1,000 or so people from the makeshift campground.
</P>
<P>
   Some people carried small children as they fled. Some balanced
sleeping mats and pots on their heads like war refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the troops began ripping down the site, looting motorbikes
and other belongings as they went, many of those who had been
evicted formed a crowd outside the nearby royal palace. They were
augmented by hundreds of the jobless young men who loiter about the
city committing petty crimes and making a few pennies giving rides
on their motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   The running battles began under the mustard-yellow walls of the
palace with their white crenelated ornaments. Helmeted officers
charged, swinging their staves at the stands of fruit sellers. A
pyramid of coconuts bounced into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers began to beat a man dressed all in yellow but released
him when the rioters hurled a volley of stones at them. The
soldiers advanced, batting aside the stones with their plastic
shields like hockey goalies.
</P>
<P>
   The rioters threw bottles filled with gasoline. But they were
plastic water bottles and simply started small brief fires on the
asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Then a volley of automatic gunfire broke out. A U.N. official
raised his arms, shouting: ``Hold it! Stop! Stop it!''
</P>
<P>
   Instead the soldiers began running toward the rioters, some
firing their weapons from their hips. Troops chased rioters down
alleyways and toward the Tonle Sap River, where two buses with
tourists from Hong Kong were parked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the mobs had spread through the city, near the ancient Wat
Phnom pagoda, in front of the railway station, outside the
Information Ministry, around the central market and across the
street from the Cambodiana.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set the mobs began to disperse, and the streets fell
silent as scavengers picked among the discarded plastic bags and
soiled sleeping mats of the abandoned campsite.

GROUP BEHIND OMAGH BOMBING DECLARES CEASE-FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ A splinter group of the Irish
Republican Army that killed 29 people in a bomb attack in the town
of Omagh three weeks ago said in a statement Tuesday that it had
permanently ended its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, by the Real IRA, means that with one exception
all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, Roman Catholic and
Protestant, are now observing cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   The curtailment of violence improved the atmosphere in which the
politicians of this British province will try to enact the
provisions of a peace agreement approved last spring by the
Catholic minority and the Protestant majority. The agreement, which
was overwhelmingly approved in referendums here and in the Irish
Republic, envisions reforms that will give the minority more
political power and the Irish Republic more influence in northern
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-month cease-fire by the IRA has allowed the peace effort
to move forward. But smaller groups, like the Real IRA, continued
their violence, charging that the agreement was a sellout of
republican principles since it did not establish a united Ireland,
free of British control, run from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this is now a complete end to all our violence,''
said John Hume, the mainstream Catholic leader who started the
peace effort six years ago in talks with Gerry Adams, the president
of the IRA's political arm, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us involved in the political process,'' Hume said,
``must now dedicate all our energies toward building new political
institutions which will be an eternal monument to the victims of
our troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume, who has reduced his personal role in the peace effort for
health reasons, has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Dublin welcomed the Real IRA statement.
The group is made up of about 50 operatives, including men who were
bomb experts for the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Continuity IRA, another splinter group, has not
declared a cease-fire. Security officials say it has not been
active in recent months and the police denied a claim by the group
that it attacked a police car last week.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said of the Real IRA
cease-fire, ``This does nothing for the people who who were killed
in Omagh or for the relatives of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Irish government would continue to search for those
who planted the 500-pound bomb in Omagh, in the center of the
province, on Aug. 15. And he suggested that the government would be
helped by the package of new laws approved by the parliament last
week, which are intended to make it easier for the police and
courts to imprison suspects in terrorist cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cease-fire is to do with the new legislation and
the outcry of the people over the atrocity,'' Ahern said.
Parliamentary opposition members in Dublin had asked why, if new
laws were needed to control terrorism, they had not been proposed
until after the Omagh attack. The new laws change the rules of
evidence in favor of prosecutors.

RUBLE'S PLUNGE DARKENS RUSSIAN MARKET IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-MARKETPLACE, RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Normally the Yabao Road market here is a bustling
place, with more than 2,000 bountiful stalls crammed full of gaudy
fur coats, bejeweled fuzzy sweaters, lavish blond wigs and
formidable lacy bras _ reflecting the latest fashion trends not of
Beijing, but of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Here, throngs of independent Russian traders buy cheap Chinese
goods in bulk for sale back home, providing a brisk business for
the market's Chinese stall-owners, many former government employees
who have gone into business for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruble's plunge over the last two weeks has transformed
this once-prosperous market into something of a ghost town. The
Russians can no longer afford to buy here. So, on this steamy
summer day, on the block that begins at the Moscow Restaurant, the
only residents of the vast outdoor market are anxious store owners,
drawing on cigarettes or playing chess, and idle freight company
employees watching television and playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   Business is off by 80 or 90 percent, they say, now that the
Russians are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money I've made in the last two weeks is not enough for
food, let alone the rent,'' Liu Zhanguo, 22, said, looking up from
a newspaper in a room full of lifeless furs. ``All our business is
from Russia, so we are finished if the ruble doesn't rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   At stall nine, which sells up-market children's snowsuits, a man
named Sun sits glumly on a wooden chair. He said he had made a lot
of money here since he quit his job in the Public Security Bureau
of Anhui Province five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined it could get this bad,'' said Sun, who said
he was embarrassed to give his full name. ``Last year this time I
could sell 1,000 garments in an afternoon. Now I haven't sold a
single item in the last three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yabao Road market, also known as the Russian market, is one
small piece in what has been a thriving trade between Russia and
China, sustaining thousands of businesses small and large, private
and public in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the official value of China's trade with Russia was
$6.2 billion, including $2 billion in exports from China, mostly
textiles, food and garments, said Lu Nankuan, vice director of the
Center for Russian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social
Science.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that statistic does not include the unofficial
export trade from places like Yabao Road: Officially, the Russians
who buy thousands of wigs and coats are not businessmen, but
tourists or dao ye (that is a derogatory term for itinerant traders
who wander from place to place selling wares).
</P>
<P>
   This unofficial trade is estimated to be worth $3 billion
annually, Lu said, adding, ``The devaluation of the ruble will
definitely affect China's exports this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the ruble's nose dive is not nearly as disastrous for
China as the fall of the Japanese yen, said Li Guobin, an economist
at the State Information Center, which is associated with China's
State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   China has export and import trade with Russia, so while a
falling ruble means that Russians buy fewer Chinese goods, it also
means that China can buy less expensive cement and power-station
parts, for example. ``For China, there are good and bad things
about the ruble's devaluation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the last two weeks have been a disaster for thousands of
small-business owners who have left the security of state-owned
enterprises to live or die financially by Russian trade. Business
at wholesale markets like Yabao Road is conducted in American
dollars. And, with the ruble worth a third of what it was a month
ago, Russians do not have dollars to spend.
</P>
<P>
   As Westerners walk down the market aisles, bored vendors sitting
on small wooden stools look up hopefully from Nintendo games. ``Are
you Russian?'' they ask.
</P>
<P>
   In a small store that sells Chicago Bulls hats, Zhao Xianhan now
drinks tea and plays solitaire. Zhao, who came here two years ago
from rural Hebei, shares the stall with a woman who sells
hairpieces and and wigs, but nothing much is selling now _ only an
occasional Afghan or Romanian customer wanders in.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said that he used to make a profit of 20,000 yuan a year,
about double the average income for Beijing. But he and his wife
can no longer send money home to his parents and their child _ they
can not even afford their 4,500 yuan a month rent. ``When the
season is good we sell thousands of hats a day, but there are few
customers now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Li Hongyang, who manages a Beijing coat-factory's store in the
market said he had sold only four coats in the last two weeks, down
from 10 a day in July and hundreds or thousands a day this time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of stalls have decided to close temporarily. The
hotels, restaurants and other service businesses that cater to the
traders are hurting as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a vast hanger-like packing station, small clusters of men who
are paid to pack purchases for air shipment to Moscow sit on the
empty cement floor around a flickering black and white television.
Co-workers play cards or nap on broken cardboard boxes, which in
better times carried clothes and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Ruijun, who said he worked for a Moscow air transport
company, fiddled with the antenna of the jury-rigged set. ``We
packed four boxes today,'' he said. ``It should be more than 600.
We have nothing to do.''

   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN &QL; 
 &UR; Simon Winchester (HarperCollins, $22)
</P>
<P>
   One autumn day in 1896, James Murray, editor of the ``Oxford
English Dictionary,'' traveled by train to the village of
Crowthorne, England, to see a man with whom he had corresponded for
nearly 20 years. W.C. Minor was one of many volunteers who had
helped Murray assemble the dictionary (he had contributed more than
10,000 neat, handwritten definitions). The two never had met _
Minor had declined to do so, without explanation. Now, in
Crowthorne, Murray found a carriage waiting, and he was taken to a
forbidding mansion at the end of a long drive. It was, he was
stunned to learn, England's harshest asylum for the criminally
insane, and W.C. Minor was a murderer who was profoundly and
irreversibly mad. His work with Murray had been his medicine for
two decades, his link with sanity. Winchester tells the story of
the two men with an arch, spare tone that emphasizes its Victorian
roots, its eccentricities and the sad life of W.C. Minor. ``One
must feel a strange gratitude,'' he writes, ``that his treatment
was never good enough to divert him from his work. The agonies that
he must have suffered in those terrible asylum nights have granted
us a benefit, for all time. He was mad, and for that, we have
reason to be glad. A truly savage irony, on which it is
discomfiting to dwell.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; NO SAFE PLACE &QL; 
 &UR; Richard North Patterson (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here's something new and different, a novel about a sexual
affair that threatens the career of a powerful politician. Kerry
Kilcannon hasn't reached the presidency yet but he's running for
it, and the woman involved is not an intern, but Lara Costello, a
network news reporter who met Kilcannon when she was working for
the ``New York Times.'' Patterson packs so much around this core
plot that it's dizzying. There's the candidate's background, which
includes a bad marriage, a mother who brutally was beaten by
Kilcannon's father, a law career during which Kilcannon was shot by
the husband of a client, and a brother, also a politician, who was
assassinated on the campaign trail. There's a cast of advisers who
meet for arduous discussions on political strategy and damage
control. There's the press corps, with its competitive sniping and
black humor. And there's an anti-abortion zealot who shot three
people at an abortion clinic and now is stalking Kilcannon. It
takes 500 pages to carry it all. The dialogue sounds authentic
despite the many roles Patterson portrays, and the sex-and-politics
angle is not as wearying as you expect it to be. This is the kind
of affair you wouldn't mind your politicians having, with love
outweighing the scandal and no dresses left behind. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PURE DRIVEL &QL; 
 &UR; Steve Martin (Hyperion, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   We have complained about the recent spate of books written (a
term loosely applied) by comedians, but none of them had the
audacity to refer to Marcel Proust by his initials, to rewrite a
paragraph by Milan Kundera or to mention the Booker Prize without
explaining what it is. Steve Martin thinks he's talking to  &UR; smart
people, here, and flattery will get him everywhere, or at least put
him out ahead of the competition. We must warn you that this is a
slight book (just over 100 small pages), and, therefore, pricey,
and Martin admits that the essays in it are ``little candy kisses,
after-dinner mints to the big meal of literature.'' But it's fluff
with thought behind it, by a man who uses the word ``antecedent''
and still makes you laugh. David Mamet read it and said, ``This is
a ril, ril funny book.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LASSO THE WIND &QL; 
 &UR; Timothy Egan (Knopf, $25)
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Terry Tempest Williams, a wonderful
writer who has contributed an admiring blurb for the jacket, we
suggest that this book was written for people in the East. Closer
to home, you might have had your fill of writers who set out to
explore the grand question of what has happened to ``the West.''
From the start, there's swagger in Egan's tone (hiking in the Grand
Tetons, he complains that ``I had heard too many lies about the
`Real West,' flimflam and fraud retold as gilded narrative by
people whose grandparents took the land by force and have been
draining the public trough ever since to keep it locked in a
peculiar time warp of history. I needed a land without filter or
interpretation _ the West, unplugged.''). We couldn't help thinking
that he had been beaten to the punch by writers with truer hearts
and less lofty book proposals. He quotes many of them as he visits
Western states and profiles issues, people and places. Included are
Supai and Lake Havasu City, with mention of Phoenix and the cotton
farms ``outside Mesa and Glenwood.'' Egan is the Pacific Northwest
correspondent for the ``New York Times.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TAKING CHARGE &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Beschloss (Touchstone, $16)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is this look at Lyndon Johnson through secret
recordings of conversations he had during his presidency. The
transcripts cover from November of 1963 to August of 1964, and
include a touching passage in which Johnson expresses anguish over
sending American soldiers to Vietnam. Beschloss, who transcribed
and edited the tapes, acknowledges the ``earthy, vulnerable,
suspicious, affectionate, devious, explosive, funny, domineering,
sometimes threatening private man who strides across the pages of
this book. That the tapes might one day offer later generations a
sustained look at the more primal Lyndon Johnson may have bothered
him. But it is safe to assume that one thing would bother him more
_ being forgotten.'' &QL;

   Wow! This book has it all: colors, patterns, animals and

colorful patterns on one page are clues about which animal lurks

   ``I am a Red Fox. I hunt for rodents, birds, and sometimes
frogs. I hide in dark, safe places. Where do I live?'' Across the
page is a portrait of an adorable fox. Lift the flap to reveal the
fox in its natural surroundings, along with the answer: a forest.

   It begins with a great big kid who's about to flatten an ant
with his tennis shoe. The ant, holding two shopping bags, takes on
human dimensions as it pleads for its life. It's got a home and a
family to feed, too. As the big kid's buddies urge him to squish, a
sudden role reversal occurs. The ant grows tall and the boy shrinks
to antlike size. After a turn in the ant's shoes, the kid thinks
again. What do you think he should do?

 &UR; COYOTE IN LOVE WITH A STAR &QL; 
 &UR; Marty Kreipe de Montano; illustrated by Tom Coffin (Abbeville
Press, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix artist Coffin, a Kansas native and member of the Prairie
Band Potawatomi and Creek tribes, pens the whimsical illustrations
in this tale about a coyote who moves from the plains to New York
City. In his VW bus, coyote negotiates the bustling urban streets
(lined with signs such as ``Cuban Chinese food'') and gets himself
a job as the rodent control officer for the World Trade Center.
There, he stargazes at night, eventually falling for a special star
that takes him on a wild dance to the edge of the sky. De Montano
put this modern spin on a traditional Native American story.
</P>
<P>
   The title is among several in the ``Tales of the People''
series, published in partnership with the Smithsonian's National
Museum of the American Indian. The picture books are written and
illustrated by Native Americans. For ages 4 to 8. &QL;

 &UR; Robert Burleigh; illustrated by Mike Wimmer (Harcourt Brace, $16)
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth died 50 years ago, but his legacy lives on in this
old-fashioned picture book about one of the greatest players who
ever lived. Wimmer's paintings, in the realistic style of Norman
Rockwell, capture the action of Babe at bat and his fans'
amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh writes in free verse, giving the game a poetic quality:
``He watches the pitcher lean. Rotate. Rock back and forth. The leg
wheels out. The arm whips over the head. Babe narrows his
hunter-like gaze and strides into the pitch that is now only a tiny
speck of whirling whiteness.'' Baseball cards on each page add
facts and figures that will interest older readers. For ages 4 to
8. &QL;

   Elizabeth and TaraStarr (she uses a star in her name, of course)
are friends, like the writers who created them, Danziger (best
known as the creator of the Amber Brown novels) and Martin (of the
Baby-Sitters Club). When Tara moves away with her family, she and
Elizabeth continue their close relationship through correspondence
that reveals their contrasting personality traits, modeled on those
of the book's authors.
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing exchange is a clever vehicle for covering the
concerns of pre-adolescence: peer-group acceptance, school
challenges, geeky parents and those awful but exciting parties.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth comes from monied parents who lose everything when
Dad's employment abruptly ends. (``Dad said something about a
package. Do they give going-away presents to people they fire?''
asks Elizabeth.) Tara writes condescendingly of her ``charents (my
CHildlike pARENTS),'' who are young and not so well off
financially. But she realizes how lucky she is to live in a loving
home. Great friends, fun book. For ages 8 to 12. &QL;

terrible storm struck, causing one of the worst disasters in the
mountain's history. Eight people perished, and their ordeal became
the basis of the bestselling adult book ``Into Thin Air'' and an
IMAX film, ``Everest.'' What was a 16-year-old kid doing there, a
few steps from death?
</P>
<P>
   Pfetzer, the youngest person to attempt Everest, describes the
perilous night of May 10, 1996, and his nine other climbs of the
world's highest peaks. He also talks about becoming a karate black
belt at age 11, a certified emergency medical technician at age 17,
and his ambition to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   His determination will inspire children and dumbfound adults.
The first-person narrative is heavy on action but light on insight
about the forces driving Pfetzer's relentless climb to achieve. For

The Foreign Student 
Susan Choi (HarperFlamingo, $23) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an anecdote that Eudora Welty once told, about when she
was young and just beginning her career as a writer and she thought
that the moon rose in the western sky. She described it that way in
one of her stories, and a critic informed her that she had
misplaced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offered valuable words to me about my profession,'' she
said later. ``Always be sure you get the moon in the right part of
the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of this as I read ``The Foreign Student'' by Susan
Choi, a writer who knows exactly where the moon should be, and a
good many other things besides. So many first novelists write books
full of saved-up images and earnest performance, but Choi seems to
have put self-interest aside and made a pact with the story about
how it wanted to be told. Her allegiance to it is absolute, her
prose elegant and self-assured. If this is the first step in her
writing life, there's no telling where she might go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Foreign Student'' opens with the arrival of a young Korean
man named Chang Ahn _ in America, he will be called ``Chuck'' _ at
a college in Sewanee, Tenn. He is to be a student there, but we do
not know why or through what means. It is 1955, just after the end
of the war in Korea. We learn that things did not go well for Chuck
there, and so he exists now in a state of transience.
</P>
<P>
   He was a translator for the Americans, but had no ties to them
beyond his grasp of English. He has lost his best friend, Kim, a
Communist who fled to North Korea after the war. His relationship
with his once-aristocratic parents is now distant. Indeed, Chuck's
strongest link to his homeland is buried in the nightmares he has
each night, the terrible, violent dreams that will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Chuck is very appealing without ever seeming
especially admirable. Choi captures perfectly his faulty English,
which was a great skill in Korea but in America makes him seem
vulnerable and even ingratiating. His delicate courtesy is offset
by his presence in a country that is alive with anti-Communist
sentiment. Away from the familiar world of the university, people
stare openly at him. Chuck absorbs it almost dutifully. There are
no traumas here that can compare with those he knew at home.
</P>
<P>
   Two people come to play important roles in Chuck's new life. One
is Charles Addison, a charismatic professor who helps Chuck with
his English. The other is Katherine Monroe, the young woman who has
been Addison's mistress since she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine is adrift, troubled by her long estrangement from her
wealthy mother and by the emotional confusion of her relationship
with Addison. She, like Chuck, is a refugee from a troubled past,
and soon after they meet, a quiet awareness rises between them. We
spend the rest of the novel waiting out a sense of pending romance
that is no less appealing because it exists between the most
unlikely of people.
</P>
<P>
   Choi sees her characters through this story with great control
and attention to detail. She describes the arc of water that rises
from a vase hurled through the air by an angry Katherine, the
shreds of eraser that fall to the floor beneath Chuck's math
equations, the smell of an old woman's perfume as it clings to
everything ``shyly, like an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   She also has a way with dialogue, especially when Katherine and
her mother, Glee, reunite after years of silence. Their exchanges
are gritty and wary and full of venom, but they push toward
reconciliation and love. In the end, it is Glee who grants
acceptance to Katherine's new path in life, even as she had
condemned long ago her daughter's choice of Charles Addison.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a weakness in ``The Foreign Student'' it is that the
sections about Chuck's life in Korea seem flat compared with those
that take place in Sewanee and at Katherine's family home in New
Orleans (the exception is a wrenching chapter about Chuck's flight
from Seoul and his torture by Korean police _ it is one of the most
harrowing war stories you will ever read). Choi also withholds
information unnecessarily _ only in the final pages do we learn the
details of how Chuck ended up in Tennessee, and it was not worth
wondering about for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there are reasons for these things. Choi suggests that
Chuck was never as foreign as we thought him to be, that his life
in Korea did not define him. In coming to Tennessee _ to Katherine
_ he claimed his freedom. He was, in a way, coming home.
</P>
<P>
   Here is all I know about Susan Choi: She is 29. She is a
fact-checker at the ``New Yorker.'' And she is a very promising
writer who knows that the moon has its place in the sky, and that
the truth of a story lies in the strength and elegance of its
telling. &QL;

`POINT OF ORIGIN' SUCCUMBS TO WEAK PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
Point of Origin 
Patricia Cornwell (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $25.95) 
 
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since her first novel, 1990's ``Postmortem,'' Patricia Cornwell
has shown just how much detective work a medical examiner can
accomplish armed with a scalpel and a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense tale won Cornwell several awards and introduced
readers to Dr. Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner for the
commonwealth of Virginia. The novel showed the more passive side of
detective work as Scarpetta, using microscopic clues found on the
bodies of the victims, was able to help track down the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell followed with eight more novels involving Scarpetta,
including the latest, ``Point of Origin.'' Not much has changed in
Scarpetta's world, and that's the problem. If anything, the plots
have become thinner and the characters flatter.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in ``Point of Origin,'' they're getting old, too.
Scarpetta is seemingly always tired. There are numerous references
to the thinning hair and advancing age of police Capt. Pete Marino,
Scarpetta's partner in crime-solving. Even Benton Wesley,
Scarpetta's lover and the fittest of the group, complains about how
old he has gotten.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts off with a mysterious letter that Scarpetta
receives from Carrie Grethren, a convicted serial killer imprisoned
in a hospital for the criminally insane whom Scarpetta and Wesley
helped track down in an earlier novel. To complicate matters,
Grethren had an affair with Scarpetta's niece, Lucy, while the two
were working for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   When Grethren escapes, Wesley is called in by the FBI to assist.
He and Scarpetta, working with Lucy, now with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Marino, who amazingly has no
other cases to work on, investigate a series of mysterious fires to
which they believe Grethren is somehow linked.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the characters seem to have evolved, but they
haven't. Scarpetta still has too much work to do. She and Wesley
still have to keep their relationship secret because of
conflict-of-interest issues. Marino's still ornery. Lucy's still
angry.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, Cornwell does take a risk with a central
character in this novel, which results in a side of Scarpetta
rarely seen in earlier novels. But the events that follow the plot
twist are predictable, too.
</P>
<P>
   And even the plot, which had driven the author's previous
novels, is noticeably thin. It relies too heavily on knowledge from
earlier books, as if Cornwell wanted to tie ends left loose years
ago (or it's a not-so-subtle nudge for new readers to buy the older
works). The ending is hurried, contrived and unrealistic, the clues
put together in a rush of sudden epiphanies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fans will continue to buy Cornwell's books
regardless. That's the benefit of a good first impression. But
perhaps Cornwell should examine her own point of origin and start
over from there. Let Scarpetta retire. After all, she isn't getting
any younger. &QL;

ELECTION YEAR MAKES DIFFERENCE IN TAX TALK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush returned to Texas from
``nonpresidential'' campaign stops in other states last week to
propose modest tax cuts for the home folks, and Garry Mauro, his
Democratic re-election challenger, yelled, ``Gotcha!''
</P>
<P>
   No, not in the polls. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, still struggling to get his one campaign off the ground
while Bush is able to fly two at the same time, accused the
governor of committing a major political sin on taxes _ the
flip-flop.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Mauro is correct. But, politically, the issue will
be debated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now wants to repeal the state sales tax on nonprescription
drugs, diapers and most health aids and declare a limited,
back-to-school tax holiday on inexpensive clothing for children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush asked the Legislature to raise the same sales
tax by a half cent per dollar on nonprescription drugs, diapers,
health aids and all the other hundreds of goods and services that
the tax covers.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers enact Bush's new tax-cut proposal, the average
Texas family will save about $35 a year, depending on how many
children a family has, how often they get sick, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   If legislators had enacted Bush's tax plan last year, which they
didn't, that same average family would have paid $71 a year in
higher sales taxes, according to the governor's own estimate.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference an election year can make.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Bush, however, the sales tax increase he proposed
last year would have been part of a tradeoff for lower school
property taxes. The higher sales taxes under that more far-reaching
plan, according to the governor's estimate at the time, would have
been more than offset by an average savings of $333 a year in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected the proposal, because it also included
a controversial change in business taxes and many lawmakers didn't
have the stomach to raise the sales tax or any other tax in a year
when state government had a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   So legislators gave taxpayers less than half of the property tax
relief the governor had requested _ about $140 a year _ by merely
raising the homestead exemption on school taxes. Lawmakers paid for
it by taking $1 billion of the budget surplus for this biennium and
giving it to school districts, which also had been part of Bush's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   With an even larger surplus forecast for the next budget period,
tax cut fever is more prevalent than ever among political
candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wants to use a large chunk of the surplus, which could
grow to as much as $6 billion, to pay for a $6,000-a-year teacher
pay raise. But he also has proposed eliminating the sales tax on
motor vehicles and paying for it by doubling the ``sin'' taxes on
alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans don't buy new cars very often, but when they did the
several hundred dollars they would save under Mauro's proposal
would be much more noticeable than the few pennies they would save
on a bottle of pain reliever under Bush's new plan.
</P>
<P>
   You could even argue, just for the fun of it, that Mauro, the
Democratic nominee, has the Republican tax-cut plan, and Bush is
promoting a Democratic tax-cut option.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican would save a lot more tax money on a new Cadillac
or Lexus than a Democrat would on an old, beat-up Chevy. Since the
auto sales tax is 6.25 percent of the vehicle's price, the more
expensive the car, the greater the savings.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro would argue that that old, beat-up Chevy and whatever
taxes are saved on it may be worth their weight in gold to a
working-class Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   For most Texans, meanwhile, the $35 a year they could expect to
save under Bush's limited sales tax cut would hardly scratch their
budget. Low-income Texans, however, would benefit the most because
they pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than
middle-income and wealthy people do.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy reliance on the sales tax is one reason Texas has one
of the most regressive tax systems in the country. Bush didn't seem
concerned about that fact when he proposed an increase in the sales
tax last year, but, as noted earlier, this is an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's property tax cut, which Bush calls the
largest (collectively) in Texas history, the governor may fear he
still needs to strengthen his tax-cut record for his anticipated
White House race.
</P>
<P>
   He is on record during the 1997 session proposing a new business
tax and a general sales tax increase, something other presidential
contenders may try to make an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, another likely contender for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000, already has called Bush the ``tax man in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also has challenged Bush and other governors to outlaw
taxes on Internet services. And guess what? Bush's new tax relief
plan also proposes a sales tax exemption for Internet access.
</P>

OPINIONATED DUO SERVE UP BEST SELECTIONS FOR YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a book for a child can be an intimidating process, with
an overwhelming number to choose from, uncertainties about what is
age-appropriate, and chagrin over price tags. Even choosing a free
library book can be a daunting experience.
</P>
<P>
   Help has arrived. Valerie V. Lewis and Walter M. Mayes have
narrowed the possibilities to a mere 2,000 titles in their new
``Valerie &AMP; Walter's Best Books for Children: A Lively, Opinionated
Guide,'' published by Avon Books for $15.
</P>
<P>
   Their selections neatly are cataloged for easy reference,
according to age and reading and listening levels. An index even
groups titles according to topics and themes, such as trains,
stepfamilies, emotions, fear of the dark and woodchucks.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a section called ``tricky situations and frequently
asked questions.'' Sidebars and inspirational tips on such subjects
as choosing a book, series fiction, exceptional authors and
literary classics are interspersed.
</P>
<P>
   The one-paragraph book summaries are done in an amusing style.
When Valerie and Walter agree that a book is the best of the best,
a star is printed next to the title. When they disagree, each one
weighs in with a few comments, a la Siskel and Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selections aren't included in the guide unless
Valerie and Walter believe in their merit, every now and then they
raise an eyebrow, as in this passage about H.A. Rey's ``Curious
George'':
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not wish to be curmudgeonly, but we need to say that
much of George's appeal is lost on us as adults. Oh, we read them
as children and later to our own children, and we acknowledge the
fact that they delight. But we are at a loss to explain why they
are popular. Is it just that George embodies curiosity so well? Is
it a nostalgia for simpler times, perhaps, when a man in a big
yellow hat taking a monkey from the jungle could be looked upon
fondly and not as a poacher? Or is it that George is simply
beloved, period, and we just don't get it? Do not let us stop you
from making up your own mind, as there is certainly plenty of
George to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you feel like you know and trust the two
knowledgeable characters who tackled this massive project (their
original list of titles topped 8,000).
</P>
<P>
   Mayes, also known as Walter the Giant Storyteller, is a
book-sales representative who talks nationwide with parents and
kids about books. Lewis, owner of Hickelbee's children's bookstore
in San Jose, is children's book correspondent for ``CBS This
Morning.'' They've worked together since 1981, and their
comfortable writing style reflects the friendship. &QL;

 &HT;    O'Leary gets defensive after loss to BC
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather was cool during Georgia Tech's football
practice Monday, but coach George O'Leary was hot and sweaty after
the workout.
</P>
<P>
   Not sweaty from nervousness, which easily could have been the
case two days after watching Tech's defensive debacle in a 41-31
loss to Boston College. He was sweaty from trying to do something
about it. After a preseason of watching the defense practice from
20 yards back, with a clipboard in hand, the former defensive line
coach has rolled up his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking in the mirror,'' said O'Leary, whose defense
allowed 491 yards to the Eagles. ``I'm taking responsibility. We
need to get tougher, more aggressive at the point of attack. If the
guys out there aren't getting it done, we'll get someone out there
who will.''
</P>
<P>
   He practically participated in some of the defensive drills,
disappearing into the middle of the defensive line after one play
and reappearing with his hands on a scout-team offensive lineman to
show defensive lineman John Grantham what he wanted. The next play
Grantham, a reserve defensive lineman, put that same lineman on his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surprising loss to Boston College, practice has had
``a little bit more focus, attention, a sense of urgency,''
first-year defensive coordinator Randy Edsall said. ``If there
isn't, there's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (the game) was embarrassing. . . . It was a poor
performance. No sugarcoating, no nothing. Basically, I'm the guy
that's responsible. It's my job to make sure I go out and make
these kids better.''
</P>
<P>
   While the personnel changes O'Leary is trying this week aren't
exactly wholesale, they are significant. He has replaced two
seniors _ linebacker Justin Robertson and end Roderrick Roberts _
with younger players who have shown more promise. Redshirt freshman
Matt Uremovich is getting a shot at weakside linebacker and
sophomore Tony Robinson has moved in at defensive tackle. Senior
Nate Stimson has moved from tackle to end.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary will use Saturday's game against New Mexico State to
decide if these changes are right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we have to get a lot more aggressive and a
lot tougher with our assignments on defense,'' O'Leary said.
``That's all coachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors contributed to Saturday's performance, including
inexperience. Delaunta Cameron, the only returning linebacker,
missed the first two weeks of preseason camp with a shoulder
injury. Five of the other seven players up front were playing as
full-time starters for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tech's best defensive player _ free safety Travares
Tillman _ went down with a neck sprain in the second quarter and
missed the rest of the game. And Boston College had a strong
offense led by Scott Mutryn, a fifth-year senior quarterback, and
running back Mike Cloud, the third-leading rusher in the Big East
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was just a lack of experience or maybe some players
were just tired,'' Cameron said. ``But there are no excuses. We're
just going to have to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsall, the former secondary coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars,
watched the game film four times Sunday and decided that the
defensive scheme and the calls were proper, although it appeared
that Jacket defenders were out of place on several big plays by
Boston College. Tech coaches and players seem to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a star-studded outfit on defense,'' Edsall said.
``For us to be a good defense, each guy has to play to his
potential and beyond. If we don't do that, you see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   This defense was supposed to be better than the one that
couldn't stop Georgia and Virginia when it had to last year and
finished last in the ACC in total defense. But on Saturday, the
defense looked worse, giving up 271 yards rushing and another 220
yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things I was concerned about showed up,'' Edsall said.
``That's not to say we're throwing the towel in. We're going to be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defenders still believe in themselves, senior defensive
end Jesse Tarplin said. They've just got to correct their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that our mistakes were so big and horrible; (they
were) just simple stuff,'' Tarplin said. ``Being physical is
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two tacklers for the Yellow Jackets against Boston
College were the safeties _ Jerry Caldwell with nine tackles and
Tillman with seven. Tech will have a tough time winning if that
trend continues, and both Tarplin and Cameron know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious, (and) I know other people on defense are anxious
to show Tech fans and people in the community this is a good
defense,'' Cameron said. ``People say this will be the same defense
as last year, not aggressive. We're going to go out and show people
this weekend.''

 &HT;    Questions raised about Blue Cross, Blue Shield advantage
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's biggest health-care prize is up for grabs _
and debate _ as about 400,000 state employees and dependents are
moved to a managed care network next year.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before bids are due, a group of legislators and industry
officials are questioning whether Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Georgia, the state's largest health insurer, has a built-in
advantage to land that business.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nadine Thomas (D-Atlanta), chair of a legislative
panel studying the bid process, recently noted Blue Cross, or a
company connected to it, have ongoing contracts to handle the
claims and other administrative functions for the Georgia Merit
System.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems Blue Cross and Blue Shield's hands are all over the
Merit System,'' Thomas said. ``I have concerns about this not being
a fair (bidding) process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blue Cross on Tuesday countered that hospital-doctor
networks _ potential bid competitors _ have an edge in regions
where they have virtual medical monopolies. They can refuse to join
Blue Cross' network, or can price their bid below the insurer's,
said Neil Vannoy, a Blue Cross vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know a lot more about us than we know about them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, State Merit covers about 263,000 employees, which,
along with dependents, amounts to 546,000 Georgians. Of that total,
about 138,000 are members of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The state is moving non-HMO employees from a traditional
insurance plan to a preferred provider organization, a form of
managed care that allows patients to choose a doctor or hospital
outside a network. But they must pay more for that choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Merit System has divided the state into nine regions. Along
with Blue Cross, other possible bidders include Georgia First,
Principal/SouthCare, and Humana, as well as local hospital-doctor
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it's the largest health-care contract
available in the state of Georgia,'' said Brent Layton of
consulting firm Layton &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Without the change, the Merit System will deplete its financial
reserve and run up a huge deficit, a consultant's report said.
</P>
<P>
   The state health benefits plan lost about $32.4 million in
fiscal year 1998, after a $21 million loss the previous year. The
Merit System, if unchanged, is projected to lose $83.5 million in
fiscal 1999, according to consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to us that something major had to be done,''
Dana Russell, Merit System commissioner, told a recent legislative
hearing. ``This is not painless,'' he said. ``But it is better than
the alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   When using network doctors and hospitals, employees will still
get 80 percent or 90 percent of the charges paid for them, after
meeting a deductible. But for out-of-network care, those
percentages would drop to 60 percent or 70 percent. Premiums and
deductibles may also rise, Russell said, citing the projected
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Final bids for the nine regions are due in October, with the
selections done in December. Startup is July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, too, has insisted that Blue Cross doesn't hold a
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas and others pointed to Blue Cross' existing contracts
with State Merit as a potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Medical necessity decisions for the state plan are made by a
subsidiary of WellPoint Health Networks. WellPoint, which also does
consulting work on the Merit System's drug formulary, plans to
acquire Blue Cross in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And Blue Cross also holds a multiyear contract to handle claims
administration for State Merit, providing customer service as well.
That contract, which won't expire till 2001, is worth $29 million
annually to Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of doctor and hospital groups also have raised
questions on confidentiality of future information about a PPO,
with Blue Cross, a competitor, being the claims administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The State Employees Union pointed out that some of the bid
evaluation concerns a PPO's computer compatibility with the
administrator, Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russell acknowledged a part of the bid application deals with
that information interface. ``Perhaps there is a slight benefit''
to Blue Cross, Russell said. But ``it's such a small percentage''
of the overall evaluation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Vannoy said the Blue Cross information connection is a standard
in the industry. The firm has agreed not to use any information on
other PPOs gained through claims handling, he said.

 &HT;    Beck makes his first cut in 18 months
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Chip Beck had made a cut, on March 14,
1997, Tiger Woods was still a month away from winning the Masters.
Fuzzy Zoeller was still politically correct. Mark McGwire was still
with the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   That it happened to one of golf's truly nice guys only made it
more difficult to watch. But finally, that excruciating struggle is
over for Beck.
</P>
<P>
   After 47 tournaments without making a cut _ or a paycheck _ the
former University of Georgia player qualified Friday for weekend
play at the Greater Milwaukee Open. Two days later Beck, who turns
42 Saturday, earned the most beautiful $6,300 of his career and
tied for 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it's about time,'' Beck said. ``You never realize how
difficult something like this is until it happens to you. . . .
It's only one made cut, but when you've missed as many as I have,
it has a great impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Milwaukee, Beck had posted only three rounds in the 60s
since the Honda Classic in March 1997. Last week, he managed three
in four rounds, shooting 69-68-73-68 for a 72-hole total of 6-under
278. In an ironic twist, Beck tied with PGA champion Vijay Singh,
whose streak of 53 made cuts was snapped at this year's Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal had stretched so long, Beck had begun to research
other means of employment. Having extended himself financially
during his prolonged slump, Beck and his wife, Karen, who have four
children, have put their $6 million home in Lake Forest, Ill., near
Chicago, on the market. Beck also has two children from his first
marriage who live in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually tried to use this time, in a way, to broaden
myself,'' Beck said, ``because I feel I'm too young and I have too
many hopes and dreams for my future to just kind of die on the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Beck had given clues to the turnaround. After
shooting an opening 69 at Milwaukee, he pledged, ``You're going to
see a new Chip Beck. I'm driving the ball better than I have in
years.'' But even the final hurdle Friday did not come without
adversity. While Beck eventually would qualify easily at 5-under,
he temporarily faltered toward the end, bogeying Brown Deer's sixth
and seventh holes, on his final nine. Righting himself, Beck split
the fairway with a drive at the eighth, then birdied the ninth,
sinking a 12-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Beck said. ``In the past, I would have let
the bogeys bother me, but this time I put it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's voice was cracking when he pondered the pain of the past
two seasons. ``I've felt close in the last month or two, but I've
had such disappointments. I didn't know if I'd really be able to
come back.''

 &HT;    NELSON RETURNING TO SENIOR TOUR
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Larry Nelson, off the Senior PGA Tour for six weeks
because of a herniated disk in his neck, is returning for Friday's
Comfort Classic at the Brickyard Crossing Golf Club in
Indianapolis. After a scary period a few weeks ago, when the pain
returned to Nelson's right arm and shoulder to resurrect fears of
surgery, he found relief the last two weeks. On Monday, Nelson
declared his strength 85 percent to 90 percent returned. ``It's
exciting for me to go back to play,'' Nelson told The Golf Channel.
``I don't know what kind of factor I'll be in the tournament.'' One
thing hasn't changed since Nelson withdrew from the U.S. Senior
Open July 24. He's still third on the money list behind Hale Irwin
and Gil Morgan. But Irwin ($2,302,350) has more than doubled
Nelson's $1,087,753. Dominating his sport in stunning fashion,
Irwin has not finished out of the top five in his 16 tournaments,
has won six times and been runner-up five times. ``It's
phenomenal,'' Nelson said about Irwin. ``I don't care where you're
playing. He could be playing with the Atlanta Junior Golf
Association and it would be remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia will try anything
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calcavecchia, who will defend his Subaru Sarazen World Open
title in November, has passed $1 million in earnings for the second
straight year. Imagine what kind of year he could be having with a
trustworthy putter. Frustrated, he went to a cross-handed grip on
the 12th hole of his Friday round at the NEC World Series of Golf
two weeks ago and has decided to stick with it. For Calcavecchia,
though, that's a relative term. ``I've had quite a few rounds this
summer where I've used three or four grips in one round,'' he said.
Although Calc moved from 120th to 100th in the putting stats last
week, he's says, ``It's not like I'm standing over a 10-footer and
saying, 'Oh, this is in.' . . . I guarantee you, nobody ahead of me
on the money list has putted any worse than I have. Nobody else
with a million dollars is ranked in the hundreds.'' Not true.
There's three of them _ Vijay Singh (124th), Billy Mayfair (129th)
and Tiger Woods (132nd).
</P>
<P>
   Ammaccapane looking like her old self
</P>
<P>
   Her resurgence didn't come in time to make her one of captain
Judy Rankin's picks for the Solheim Cup team, but Danielle
Ammaccapane has moved to 10th on the LPGA money list ($417,507)
with her second win of the season Sunday at the Safeway
Championship in Portland, Ore. After finishing ninth, sixth and
third on the money list in 1990-92, Ammaccapane has not cracked the
top 25 since, falling to 84th in 1996. Her father, Ralph, a
co-owner in their Phoenix sports bar, was in tears Sunday after
Danielle's win despite a closing 72. His other daughter, Dina,
finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Since winning three tournaments in four weeks, including the
U.S. Women's Open, rookie Se Ri Pak has cooled off. She has tied
for 10th in her last two events and is second on the money list
($800,076), behind Annika Sorenstam ($806,188). . . . England's
Justin Rose, 18, who needs to earn 55,000 pounds for an exemption
on the European Tour in 1999, has not yet made a cut. He has two
events remaining out of his seven sponsor exemptions, but he seems
headed for qualifying school. . . . President Clinton played
Ballybunion in Ireland last week, missing some lurking headstones
that border the first tee and robbing assembled reporters of some
potential symbolism. . . . U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne and
last year's champion, Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar, head the four-man
team that will represent the U.S. at the World Amateur Team
Championship in Chile Nov. 19-22. Also named were 1998 U.S. Amateur
runnerup Tom McKnight of Galax, Va., and Joel Kribel of Pleasanton,
Calif., who lost to Kuchar in 1997. . . . Jeff Sluman's
neighborhood cleaned up at the Greater Milwaukee Open. Rick Bruder,
Sluman's Chicago neighbor, agreed to caddie for him at the last
minute. ``He probably kept me relaxed,'' Sluman said about Bruder,
who is not a golfer himself. ``I was kind of laughing inside at how
nervous he was.''

 &HT;    Trio of companies help medical industry cut costs, coordinate
care, enter Information Age
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was not until April that the Information Age dawned
in the examination rooms of Evanston (Ill.) Obstetrics and
Gynecological Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, when the four doctors saw patients, questions were
asked, notes were scrawled and paper was filed. Same as it ever
was. Norman Rockwell could have painted that picture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dr. Ned Wagner sits at a PC before and after exams. He
types what he's learned into a database readable by each doctor at
each office. Within a year, that information will be available to
all 81 doctors in the Illinois Evanston Hospital pre-natal group.
</P>
<P>
   And now, when a patient's sample comes back from the lab, a
software program prompts Wagner to make sure the results are
normal, asks whether the patient has been told the results and
whether follow-ups are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealth and the power of the tool of electronic records is
shared information in the community of physicians that care for a
patient,'' Wagner said. ``The repetitive nature of what we do makes
it possible to streamline some of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Information Age is also the era of corporate medicine. Under
managed care, doctors are becoming subsidiaries, turning their
practices from mom-and-pop shops into sophisticated small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consolidation is forcing doctors to share information
outside the walls of their office with others in their health care
groups.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of Atlanta companies are helping meet the need, making
hundreds of millions of dollars supplying the health care field
with easier ways to swap those facts.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, health care groups, hospitals and doctors offices
are expected buy $17 billion worth of information technology this
year.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. is the industry leader, taking in $1.2 billion last
year selling ways to reduce the paper trail in offices like
Wagner's in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Medaphis had revenue of $573 million last year selling, among
other things, computer systems that automate billing, scheduling
and patient admitting.
</P>
<P>
   National Data Corp.'s health care division took in $358 million
in 1997 automating things such as billing records and prescription
forms. NDC started as a processor of prescriptions for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Americans started clamoring for lower health
care costs. The amount Americans spent for health care shot from
about 9 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product in 1980 to 13.6
percent in 1996, an increase of $450 billion, according to the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers further increased the need for technology, putting more
pressure on those running the new companies, said Steve Ely,
Medaphis' vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who has been then CEO of a $200 million company
suddenly becomes, through acquisition, the head of a $1.5 billion
company,'' Ely said. ``There's more information to deal with. They
start looking at how they can improve their information technology
infrastructure to get a better handle on their business systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care also has been a factor, forcing doctors to be
concerned about insurance coverage and what it does or does not pay
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors can't make arbitrary choices anymore,'' Ely said.
``Automating some of the coverage issues increases their efficiency
and increase the time they can focus on their patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Medaphis' revenues have hovered in the $500 million to $600
million range for the last three years. Its stock traded at $50 as
recently as April 1996, but has sat below $12 the last 18 months.
Problems with one of the technology companies Medaphis acquired in
1994 led to lower-than-expected earnings, which dropped share
prices 60 percent in August of 1996 and 38 percent in October of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are slowly emerging from a turnaround, and the new
management team is what people are betting on going forward,'' said
Steve Fitzgibbons, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP;Co. became the industry leader, in part, by buying its
competition: 17 companies since 1993, plus two announced this
summer that await stockholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbons said HBO &AMP; Co. has no real weak spot. Its stock has
appreciated almost 1,400 percent since 1997. Its management is
respected. Integrating software from the newly acquired companies
is one of its few challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan James, vice president of marketing for HBO &AMP; Co., said
the company spends between $50 million and $60 million a year
integrating software.
</P>
<P>
   NDC President Robert Yellowlees said the growth information
technology in health care is still a relatively untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest segment of the economy with a relatively low
level of automation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors' offices, systems start at $100,000 and can run as
high as $750,000, depending on size of the group and power of the
hardware. Systems for hospitals start at $500,000, HBO &AMP; Co.'s
James said.
</P>
<P>
   James said the key is to make the computer systems easy to use
and powerful. ``Doctors see 25 to 40 patients a day,'' he said.
``Anything that slows them down they will reject.''
</P>
<P>
   James said the health care industry is moving toward systemwide
computer systems _ admitting to scheduling to CAT scans to home
health care visits to billing, all from one source.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to learning new technology, Evanston's Wagner had
an edge. He designed a software program his hospital group has used
for years to manage the treatment of patients with abnormal pap
smears. The rest of his office was less receptive, more like
doctors in general, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest hurdle for doctors is that it's a change in
behavior,'' Wagner said. ``Using paper and charts to accumulate
data is a time-honored and well-honed tool. Everyone has a pen in
their pocket, not everyone has a terminal at their fingertips. The
low-hanging fruit is to show them how it makes the tedious
easier.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Excuse me. After you.'' Robot welders know nothing about
speaking or manners, of course, but there are times when they need
to be ``nice.'' And that's what Patent No. 5798627 does.
</P>
<P>
   Recently issued to Malcom Gilliland of Marietta and Kenneth
Gilliland of Atlanta, the patent protects a method for preventing
collisions of two or more robot welders operating close together.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preventing wrecks on the robot highway, the
patent also covers technology that protects objects being welded
from overheating and distortion.
</P>
<P>
   The robot welders are programmed to perform certain tasks and to
stop at specified points in the job. Then, via electronic
communication with a central controller, they are directed to their
next tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The controller might direct one robot to pause so that a second
robot can pass by without collision, or perform a specified welding
operation that is best done when the first robot is not working.
Several robots can be directed by the controller.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pause or operation is completed, the robots resume
their programmed tasks when the controller determines they are in
the correct positions.
</P>
<P>
   Welding can cause excessive heating of the welded object if two
or more operations are performed closely together in space or time.
The heat can cause distortion of the object, a problem prevented by
Patent No. 5798627.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gilliland said the controlled robots were developed for
welding metal panels of Navy ships, but they could be adapted to
other welding jobs, such as auto manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   One day when you apply for a loan, approval or disapproval might
be ``automatic,'' thanks to a new patent that protects a data
method for the ``automatic determination of the approval status of
a potential borrower of a loan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Patent No. 5797133 was issued Aug. 18 and assigned to
Strategic Solutions Group Inc. of Atlanta, which is now known as
Bisys Creative Solutions Inc., according to a Bisys spokesman, who
also said the firm did not grant interviews about its patents or
technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Patent Office, however, the patent
involves an automated telephone and processing system used by a
data firm or lender to take loan-application calls.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded messages give instructions and ask questions, which
callers answer by pressing buttons on their phone. The data thus
gathered is translated into numerical values and stored in a data
processor and, along with credit bureau information and criteria
provided by the lender, is used to automatically determine ``the
approval status and credit limit of the potential borrower.''

ALANIS MORISSETTE: A JAGGED VOICE COMES BACK A STAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aftershocks from Alanis Morissette's ``Jagged Little Pill''
haven't subsided since the album was released in 1995. In one
pop-culture masterstroke, the album introduced a mainstream
audience to what punks, post-punks, riot grrrls and alternative
rockers had been shouting for more than a decade: that women were
angry, intelligent, carnal, sick of being victims and ready to
speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette wasn't afraid to let her voice break or shriek;
her tunes were clear-cut while the arrangements had a raw,
distorted edge, and her words whiplashed from avenging
righteousness to self-help.
</P>
<P>
   As the album swept the Grammy Awards and went on to sell 16
million copies in the United States and an estimated 28 million
worldwide, it ushered in imitators from Tracy Bonham to Meredith
Brooks to Natalie Imbruglia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette's new album is due for release on Nov. 3, and
advance information is scarce; she has not even revealed the
album's title. But she has held on to the combination that worked
on ``Jagged Little Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   As on that album, she is writing songs with Glen Ballard, and
she is producing them with him. The album's reception will test
whether Morissette, now a star, can still connect with the longings
and frustrations of a mass audience, particularly the young women
who came to her concerts and sang along on every verse of every
song.
</P>
<P>
   The album will also test the music business itself, which in its
zeal for quick hits and niche marketing has virtually lost the
ability to build loyal audiences or follow through on blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been an era of one-hit wonders, as the music
business has promoted songs rather than careers. Yet Ms. Morissette
galvanized rock in the mid-1990s, arousing intense devotion and the
kind of equally intense antipathy that shows she struck a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Ms. Morissette's new album to out-sell ``Jagged
Little Pill''; such worldbeating albums are exceedingly rare
conjunctions of individual talent and the Zeitgeist. But if anyone
can hold on to a mass audience that has shown a rapidly diminishing
attention span, Ms. Morissette should be the one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette is by no means the only forthright woman who will
be releasing an album in the next few months. From folk-rock to
hard rock to hip-hop to pop, many of the fall's major releases are
by women.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Sheryl Crow, adding a new Celtic tinge to her
California folk-pop on ``The Globe Sessions''; Joni Mitchell, who
denounces the music business on ``Taming the Tiger,'' and P.J.
Harvey, whose blues-haunted songs are laced with eerie electronica
on ``Is This Desire?'' Jewel, on a new album this fall, will show
whether she has moved beyond platitudes, while the rapper and
empire-builder Missy Elliott has been working on a new album.
</P>
<P>
   The unclassifiable Bjork, who has been known to deploy anything
from dance rhythms to orchestral strings, may also release an album
before the end of 1998; Bette Midler's ``Bathhouse Betty'' is due
this week, perhaps bringing back some of the vulgar energy that
disappeared with her sappy 1990s hits. Hole, Courtney Love's band,
is likely to tour in conjunction with the album it released earlier
this month. Acknowledging the inevitable, Rolling Stone magazine
will release an anthology of women in rock.
</P>
<P>
   While women make artistic strides, men will be making a racket
this season, serving the eternal teen-age need for sonic mayhem and
taboo-tweaking. Marilyn Manson's latest provocation, ``Mechanical
Animals,'' is due this week, no doubt to howls of protest from some
faction he has taken pains to offend. Music fans demonstrated
through buying patterns that hard-rock's fondness for blunt impact,
its disdain for propriety and its indifference to melody linked it
to hip-hop; now bands have caught up, and a metal-rap bandwagon is
well under way.
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against the Machine, the metal-rap band whose music
harnesses free-floating teen aggression for what it hopes are
political motives, is due to release an album in November.
</P>
<P>
   Korn, another metal-rap band, whose songs agonize over the
wrongs heaped on misfits and the powerless, released ``Follow the
Leader'' in August; during the fall, it is to headline what it
calls the ``Family Values Tour,'' a caravan of loud rockers
including Monster Magnet and Fear Factory. While fans find
catharsis, adults are expected to cower.

SCHOOLS MARK A SOMBER REOPENING IN FLOOD-RAVAGED TEXAS TOWN

   DEL RIO, Texas _ The drawings, in crayon and pencil, show
fantastic scenes of raging blue oceans, insect-like helicopters,
and humanoid figures in various states of peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma Concha died. The water took away her home,'' was the
creation of one kindergarten student at Travis Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Each drawing included the child's narration as taken down by the
classroom teacher. Some dealt with less tragic themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My toys were all covered up with water,'' read one. Another
said simply, ``A wire burned me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week unscheduled vacation prompted by the floods
from Tropical Storm Charley on Aug. 23, about 10,000 Del Rio
children went back to school Tuesday. The deluge devastated parts
of this border city of 31,000, killing nine people and leaving
hundreds homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Other than having to drink bottled water, most children had not
been directly affected by the flooding, which ravaged a
lower-income neighborhood called San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students from the flood area, however, are now
living in motels, shelters or with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Tuesday, the district's top administrator reported no
significant problems at any of the 15 school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really going along quite smoothly. I've had people
standing by to resolve any situations at the campuses, and they
really haven't gotten any calls,'' Superintendent JoAnne Ackermann
said.
</P>
<P>
   For students in the San Felipe area, the flood was very personal
and very costly.
</P>
<P>
   They needed only look at the debris of their old neighborhood on
the way to school Tuesday to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, heavy equipment operators, Texas Army National Guardsmen
and state prison inmates on work details have replaced familiar
friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At Travis Elementary, which serves about 400 kindergarten
students, about 20 were absent Tuesday, a bit higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The school, like the neighborhood just to the south, had been
flooded when the San Felipe Creek left its banks after more than a
foot of rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   And on the first day back at school, the curriculum was modified
a bit to allow everyone to examine the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the classes, we're allowing the kids to express
themselves,'' Principal Linda Guanajuato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the cafeteria walls will be covered with their
illustrations. It's one way for them to tell what they saw and
felt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In each class, teachers also gave lessons from the, ``After the
Flood Coloring Book,'' which was distributed by the Red Cross after
the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the weather and how it affects us every day
and how some of their houses got flooded,'' said Veronica Guerrero,
a teacher whose class had almost perfect attendance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all but one today, and I called the mom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he was too traumatized to come back. They were
rescued in the fire truck, and he's just not ready,'' Guerrero
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Lamar Elementary escaped flooding, but a great many
of its 430 students did not.
</P>
<P>
   Three staff members also lost their homes, said Principal Maria
Ramirez, who grew up nearby and whose aging parents had to be
carried to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a third of our students were affected, and we have quite
a few that lost everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said that during the two-week flood break, teachers and
administrators tracked down and contacted each family to offer
comfort and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was we had heard about what happened and we're
here to help you in any way that we can. The children living at the
Civic Center were so excited to see someone from school,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the water fountains were all taped shut because the
water remains undrinkable, balloons and posters with cheerful
messages brightened the Lamar campus.
</P>
<P>
   One poster read, ``Welcome, Survivors.'' Another: ``We missed
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Casillas, the counselor at Lamar, said the effects of the
disaster for some children may last throughout the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the need right away to attend to the children crying in
the classrooms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other counselors have been assigned to the campus, and a
storage room has been cleaned out and converted to a counseling
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're meeting right now with mental health professionals ...
to deal with the long-range effects,'' Casillas said. ``We're
talking about parents' meetings, classroom presentations, talking
to students in groups and individual counseling.''

CONFRONTS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling to correct hed)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-five years ago this week, on Sept. 11, 1973,
the democratically elected Marxist president of Chile, Salvador
Allende Gossens, died during a military coup as planes of the
Chilean air force bombed La Moneda, the presidential palace in
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was rule by a repressive military junta led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, which lasted until the election of a
civilian president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Allende's death is recalled in a poignant and
thought-provoking double bill opening at the Film Forum. The first
portion is ``The Coup d'Etat,'' the 91-minute central section of
``The Battle of Chile,'' Patricio Guzman's remarkable record of the
Marxist period, a documentary first seen in New York in its
191-minute entirety in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The second portion is the 58-minute ``Chile: Obstinate Memory,''
the 1997 film that Guzman compiled when he returned to his homeland
to seek out survivors among Allende's supporters and to show ``The
Battle of Chile'' for the first time to members of a generation
born in the intervening years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the program provide a striking portrait of the
fervor of revolution and despair surrounding its death, it also
raises disturbing questions about the impact of historic events on
those who live in their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Some among the young weep at the repression of popular will and
the ``disappearances'' of so many of the supporters of the Allende
regime. Others look about at the stability and prosperity of Chile
and their own untroubled lives and see good in the coup, arguing
that it anticipated and bypassed a far more destructive civil war
between Chile's haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those partisans of the revolution who lived
through it and now recall their dead comrades and deal as best they
can with their memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanting to forget is self-defense,'' says Allende's widow,
Hortensia Bussi. ``I want to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the context of the longer version of ``The Battle
of Chile,'' Guzman's ``Coup d'Etat'' is freighted with tragic
inevitability as its cameras _ some operated by cinematographers
who died in the making, others who vanished forever in the junta's
prisons _ track the few months from late June 1973, when an initial
coup attempt failed, till Allende's overthrow and death.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashedly pro-revolutionary, the cameras seem to be everywhere
among the workers and marchers who put Allende in office with a
third of the national vote. At the same time, Guzman's film makes
it clear that while the workers may control many of the factories,
Allende cannot muster the support in the Chilean legislature to
carry out a Marxist program. And it leaves no doubt where the
sympathies of most in the armed forces lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile: Obstinate Memory'' would be a moving document even if
it had confined itself solely to those who supported and survived
the revolution. But by turning to members of a new generation, it
poses the most profoundly troubling of historical questions: Did
those who died die in vain?
</P>
<P>

EXOTIC RANCH HID THEFT RING, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLAR, Texas _ From behind the closed gate of the Lawhon Exotic
Ranch, officials say, the tentacles of a theft ring reached out to
five states, to Costa Rica, and even to a deceased witness in the
Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are only metal barns, some emus and the occasional
donkey on a well-kept patch of land just outside Tolar. But this
year authorities discovered a huge collection of stolen vehicles _
pickups, front-end loaders and earth-moving machines _ on the
property. The Department of Public Safety says it was the most
expensive collection of stolen vehicles it has uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when the ranch's owner, Charles W. Lawhon, 48,
was accused of stealing a Johnson County earthmover, authorities
have found more than 120 stolen vehicles valued at more than $3
million. They were scattered across Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
Minnesota and North Dakota, and the DPS says that some vehicles may
even have been shipped to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Lawhon's barn, investigators found such gee-whiz touches
as movable walls and vehicles hidden behind hay bales.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they believe that the ring had drivers who moved
vehicles and heavy equipment between Texas and the other five
states.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators say they have learned that the theft ring was
able to pluck brand-new pickups from dealerships and heavy pieces
of machinery from businesses without being detected. Some vehicles
found on Lawhon's ranch were stolen as long ago as 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The ring might still be thriving if Johnson County Commissioner
R.C. McFall had not stumbled upon Lawhon apparently trying to steal
a county-owned 38,000-pound back-end loader that had been parked
along the road, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   McFall said he is still dumbfounded by Lawhon's aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted like he was a cool cucumber,'' McFall said. ``After I
had caught him, he told my foreman, `I can't believe he thinks I
was trying to steal that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS says Lawhon was one of four principal members of the
ring, although investigators aren't certain that he was the
mastermind. Although he has been indicted in Hood and ]Johnson
counties, he is expected to go through the federal judicial system.
Don Carter, Lawhon's attorney, said his client is expected to plead
soon to federal charges, most likely interstate transportation of
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has accepted full responsibility,'' Carter said. ``He
certainly wasn't the mastermind. I think that fact will bear itself
out later, after he pleads in federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   Three others, including Lawhon's 29-year-old nephew, Johnny
Lawhon Jr. of Mabelvale, Ark., are believed to be major players,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Lawhon, who gained notoriety after finding Whitewater
documents and a cashier's check made out to President Clinton in
the trunk of a car, died March 29 in an auto accident. Internet
reports of his death were circulated on anti-Clinton Web sites
under such headings as ``Clinton Witness Life Expectancy Hits All
Time Low.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators now say they believe that Johnny Lawhon was
also part of the theft ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were four main characters _ one now deceased,'' said DPS
Sgt. Mike Ditto. ``All I can say is he was from Arkansas and some
vehicles came from Arkansas. So he had some kind of involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other men who have not been charged have been identified as
being involved. One has ties to Costa Rica, which prompted
investigators to look for stolen goods in that Central American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The theft ring used a variety of methods to steal vehicles. Law
enforcement agencies speculate that some vehicles were simply
driven off of dealer lots by people posing as employees. Others
vanished at night or were simply moved from businesses or
construction sites before anyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people knew what they were doing,'' Ditto said. ``They
knew how these dealers worked and how to move large pieces of
equipment quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lawhon owns C&AMP;S Trailer World, a custom-trailer
business, and has also owned a front-end-loader business in south
Fort Worth. His nephew worked at a transmission shop in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   After Charles Lawhon was caught in Johnson County, McFall was
concerned that Lawhon would smooth-talk his way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you saw his spread and it was unreal,'' McFall said.
``He had those movable walls and that James Bond loft, where the
ramp comes down. You could not believe that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One matter that authorities say is puzzling is why Lawhon kept
some of the property so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``His statement was he was going to have a big sale one day,''
DPS Sgt. Jimmy Towe said. ``We don't know if he really was, but
that's what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Hood County Sheriff Allen Hardin, who stowed much of the stolen
property at the Sheriff's Department until the owners could be
found, said Lawhon's real motive may have been the thrill of
stealing _ and then holding the property.

   MOSCOW _ The music is still playing and the beer is still
flowing, but three weeks into Russia's latest crisis, the good
times at the Chesterfield Cafe _ a popular watering hole for
Moscow's high-living young professionals _ are already running on
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the quietest night of the quietest week,'' said
Chesterfield manager Martin Bainbridge, who left London's night
club business two and a half years ago to take part in Moscow's
giddy expansion. ``For a week and a half, I have had people coming
in here, saying this is their last drink in Moscow. But it is worse
for the Russians, who are at the bottom, watching their ruble
literally disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil that has brought Russia to its knees is
taking a big toll on the small but visible middle class that arose
here on the wave of this city's boom, working for banks, real
estate and advertising agencies, start-up companies and Western
firms, and spent money like there was no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   It has also cut a swath through the class of foreign bankers,
brokers, traders, technicians and adventurers who came here to cash
in. Now that it is crashing, some are packing their bags.
</P>
<P>
   Until these recent weeks, Moscow's professional elite had been
insulated from Russia's economic ills. Their salaries _ paid on
time and in dollars, or at least pegged to the dollar _ were high,
in some cases higher even than Western standards. Their appetite
for the good things in life _ from expensive restaurants to
designer clothes _ changed the face of Moscow, giving it a flashy,
if sometimes vulgar, glow.
</P>
<P>
   Work in Moscow _ a city that to the rest of Russia seemed like
Disneyland, bursting with new high rises and untold riches _ was
easy to find, particularly for those Russians eager and able to
take advantage of their new-found freedom: unemployment,
officially, was less than 1 percent and that didn't count the
bustling gray economy, which has stubbornly persisted below the
radar of government tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in less than a month, all that has changed. ``It is as if
somebody came in and turned off the lights,'' said Igor Mikheyev, a
Russian television producer, who was informed Tuesday that his
studio's programs were being pulled off the air, as Russia's major
television channels cut back on daytime programming, due to a drop
in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news has come on like a steam roller. First came the
banking crisis, and the blocking of bank transactions, including
salaries and savings withdrawals. Then came the collapse of the
ruble, which has sent prices skyrocketing, and emptied the stores
and markets of imported goods. Then came salary cutbacks, and now _
with increasing frequency _ layoffs, or as some employers are
describing it, temporary unpaid holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Spending patterns have already changed drastically. Cash
registers are silent at Moscow's chic boutiques, the telephones are
quiet at foreign auto showrooms and travel agencies are reporting a
drop in bookings to Turkey and other vacation spots favored by
Russia's new middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive restaurants are seeing fewer diners, who, according to
one manager, are talking more and drinking less once they see the
exorbitant prices for imported wines and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   News on Moscow's rumor mill is traveling so fast, and the
country's condition is so grave, that no one is keeping up with the
statistics. By the estimates of one Moscow recruiting agency, about
60,000 professionals in Moscow have either been laid off, sent home
on temporary, unpaid leave, or seen their salaries cut by as much
as one third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting applications from all the banks, sometimes
entire departments,'' said Oleg Mayev, managing director of Normal
DL Consulting, a headhunting firm that recruits for top financial
and business companies. ``Our advice is simple: hold on to the job
you have, or be ready to take whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The tune has changed since the days when young, well-educated
Russians, with degrees and foreign languages, could take their pick
in an eager job market. ``It was really a mad situation,'' said
Michael Obermayer, chairman of the Eastern Europe division of
McKinsey &AMP; Co., the big management consulting firm, recalling how
he had to make a hard sell to convince Russians with business
school degrees, to accept the firm's standard salary of roughly
$100,000 a year. ``In the hey dey here, Russian companies were
literally promising them the world. I spent hours telling these
applicants to invest in themselves, and not go for the quick
buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for many Muscovites, who scrambled in recent years to find
a foothold in their new world order, just hanging on has become
agonizing. Ludmila Salnikova, editor of Health, a monthly magazine
insert, has seen its pages cut and her staff cut by half. Her own
handsome $2,000 a month salary was also halved, and then cut again
as the ruble's value is just a third of what it was against the
dollar three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a state of shock,'' said Ms. Salnikova. ``We
will print this year's last edition in October, and after that _ we
don't know. There is complete silence.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Gloom has also settled in among Russia's foreign community,
particularly in the financial sector, which has been hard hit by
the collapse of the Russian stock market and the banking system's
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   MFK Renaissance, once the hottest of Moscow's investment firms,
this week laid off 170 people, or nearly 30 percent of its staff.
At United Financial Group, another Moscow-based investment firm has
also cut staff, and dropped its salaries by an average of 30
percent, with senior executives taking cuts of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign companies are also going ahead with layoffs,
trimming costs, and putting new projects on hold. Advertising
agencies have been particularly hard hit, as several major Western
companies have curtailed both television and print campaigns, some
because their warehouses have already been emptied of goods, others
because they are holding back to see which way the Russian economy
is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Western investors are battening down the hatches,
waiting for the current storm to pass. ``We had a staff of 320
people before the crisis, and paradoxically we now have 322,'' said
Nick Gordon-Smith, managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston,
which has reported big losses from its Russian investments. ``We
want to wait for the dust to settle, then evaluate what the
business opportunities here are. In the long term, it is obvious
that Russia is going to be here. And in the long term, we know we
are keeping an office here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in business,'' said Chris Abel-Smith, the British
general manager of Premier Video Film, a leading producer of
copy-righted videos in Russia, who closed down his production
facility temporarily as retail prices began to climb. ``Ultimately,
the demand is still there, and we are still well positioned to
carry on. But you can't produce a product in this environment when
you have to pay royalties in hard currency.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis began to hit his operations two weeks ago, Robert
Greco, an importer and distributor of Heineken beer, moved quicker
than others, laying off about one half of his staff of 150,
renegotiating office and warehouse leases, even as his profits and
payments were held up in the quagmire of the Russian banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of his customers, Greco is now looking to shift to
Russian-produced beers, which are now selling at less than one half
of the price of imports.'' It just means taking a big step
backwards,'' he said. ``It is hardest on the consumers _ a middle
class that was just emerging, and starting to enjoy the imported
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Greco was nursing his beer at Chesterfield, where Bainbridge has
also had to adjust his business, and his menu, to the crisis.
Shepherd's pie and fish-and-chips, made from local products, have
substituted for T-bone steaks, imported from France. The
restaurant, which used to be open around-the- clock, now opens at 6
p.m. and closes at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The empty chairs and gloomy atmosphere are a far cry from the
old days, when Russians and foreigners, flush with cash, would drop
by on their nightly round of Moscow's lively night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is a party town,'' said Bainbridge, ``There are a lot
of young go-getting people in Moscow. In London, people go to clubs
once, twice a week. Here they were going five times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's over,'' echoed another Englishman, a
telecommunications expert who has already bought his ticket home
Friday flight, bailing out of what he sees as a painfully botched
business opportunity. ``But it was good while it lasted, wasn't
it,'' added his drinking companion, before the two ducked out the
door without giving their names.

STRAIGHT FROM CENTRAL CASTING: MARK MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He's Central Casting's first and only choice to be
the Babe Ruth of our time.
</P>
<P>
   This home run stuff isn't exactly new to Mark McGwire. He hit a
home run his first time up as a Claremont, Calif., Little Leaguer
and he has been hitting them at a regular rate ever since. And for
the past four years, he has been hitting home runs at a greater
pace than any other man in history.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will soon hold the record for most home runs in a major
league baseball season by himself. And why not? He entered Tuesday
night's game with the Cubs as the record-holder for most home runs
in two (120), three (172), and four (210) consecutive seasons _ and
he was tied with Roger Maris for one-year honors with 61.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting home runs is his craft, and it involves far more than
just sheer strength. The McGwire mind and the McGwire body are in
perfect synchronization, and they have been for a lot longer than
the past six months. McGwire has been building toward this moment
for at least six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it to our players all the time,'' said Cardinals
manager Tony La Russa, who was McGwire's first big league manager
when both were employed by the Oakland A's. ``He had the infamous
'91 (.201, with 22 home runs), and then the comeback in '92 (42
homers, 104 RBIs). But when he came to spring training in '93, you
could see he had improved his body and his conditioning. From the
first time he took BP that year, you could see he was quicker and
stronger. You ask any coach who was with our club that year. We
were saying, `Holy smokes! He's just gotten better and better.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem. While the top 98 percent of him was
just fine, the bottom 2 percent was not. After getting off to a
torrid start in '93 (15 extra-base hits and 24 runs batted in
during his first 25 games), he was sidelined with a heel injury
that would eventually require surgery. He had nine home runs in his
first 82 at-bats but he made only two pinch-hitting appearances
after May 14.
</P>
<P>
   He had problems with both his left heel and his back in 1994,
the result being that in two seasons, he was restricted to 74 games
and 219 at-bats. He spent more time on the disabled list in 1995,
but he very quietly became one of only seven major league players
to hit 30 homers in fewer than 400 at-bats. In fact, he narrowly
missed joining Hank Aaron (40/392 in 1973) as the only players to
hit 40 in fewer than 400 at-bats, finishing with a whopping 39 in
just 317.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was able to play 130 games in 1996, should anyone
have been surprised when he smashed 52 home runs? Or 58 in 156
games last year? Or whatever it is he will wind up with this
season? He is a swatmeister supreme; that's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   The more anyone looks at what McGwire is doing, the more
awe-inspiring it is. Start with the fact that he plays half his
games in Busch Stadium, which has always been a distinctly
pitcher-friendly park. The Cardinals felt so defeated by the
dimensions and ball-carrying capabilities of the stadium during the
first 25 years or so of the park's existence (it opened in 1966)
that St. Louis teams were always built on pitching and defense, and
not just because of the football-inspired artifical turf that
wasn't removed until 1996. With the exception of Jack Clark, a St.
Louis cleanup batter might hit 15 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, La Russa was managing the A's. He had been a
lifelong American Leaguer, but as a mainstream baseball guy, he was
well aware of the reputation enjoyed by Busch Stadium. Now suppose
someone had suggested to him back then that in the following
decade, Roger Maris's record would be eclipsed by a man playing for
the St. Louis Cardinals. What would he have thought?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had watched enough TV games there to see the ball come off
the bat and say, `Wow, they always seem to die at the warning
track,''' said La Russa. ``So my answer is, you can never tell
about baseball, but I would have said that it's possible but the
odds are way down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now La Russa is being asked if this assault on the record is a
unique happening or perhaps the first of many years in which the
34-year-old McGwire will threaten to raise the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be,'' he said. ``I have great respect for amazing
talent, and if I were to say to you I'd be surprised if he were to
do it again, that would mean I had underestimated his amazing
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not merely the talent that impresses La Russa. ``Mark
has superhuman powers of concentration,'' maintained the skipper.
``He has been locked in all year long. That's his greatest
strength, his strength of mind, not his strength of body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long season,'' La Russa continued. ``This is
the sixth month of the season. He has had pressure on him to
perform since the first batting practice in Jupiter (Fla.). He had
a great spring training. He hit a grand slam on Opening Day and he
had a great April. He had a great May, a great June, a great July,
and a great August. There have been no hiccups. Of his first 61
home runs, I'd say at least 40 of them have been meaningful in some
way. I believe this is one of the great clutch performances of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? Sixty-two will come and go. Once he owns the
record, he is likely to transcend relaxation and head directly to
serenity, without passing Go or collecting $200. Did someone say
70?
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing the greatest regular-season achievement in the
history of American sport. ``There are times in life to
celebrate,'' said an ebullient Bud Selig, a commissioner who
happens to love the game as few do. ``This is a time to
celebrate.''

YELTSIN'S SILENCE ON PRIME MINISTER HAS MOSCOW BUZZING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-MIDDLECLASS, CHINA-RUSSIA-MARKET.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The big news in Russia on Tuesday was what did not
happen.
</P>
<P>
   After the Communist-led parliament, in a stormy debate on
Monday, again rejected President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime
minister, he did not rush to renominate Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Yeltsin was holed up with his advisers at his residence
just outside Moscow, pondering his hand. The silence out of
Yeltsin's headquarters underscored his dilemma and nourished
speculation that he was considering other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now the president's turn to have his say,'' said Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist leader.
</P>
<P>
   None of Yeltsin's choices are good. Yeltsin could press ahead
with Chernomyrdin's nomination and dare the Communist-led
parliament to vote down his choice for a third time, a move that
would force the dissolution of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Yeltsin to stand firm against the Communists,
but it would turn the political battles over the past two weeks
into an all-out war. The Communists warned the president Tuesday
against disbanding the parliament and trying to rule by decree,
invoking the specter of huge social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin could settle on a compromise candidate. That would spare
the nation a prolonged political squabble as the Russian economy is
reeling. That, however, could also mean ceding influence and
prestige to the Communists and perhaps backing away from market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As the president weighed his options, the potential replacements
for Chernomyrdin were piously hiding their ambition under a cloak
of humility and statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Stroyev, the 61-year-old leader of the upper house of
parliament, has often been mentioned as a compromise choice. A
Yeltsin ally, he also serves as the head of the administration in
Oryol, an agricultural area south of Moscow that tends to be
pro-Communist and was the birthplace of Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Stroyev urged Yeltsin to think long and hard before
re-entering the political fray, but insisted he had no interest in
being prime minister. He endorsed Yevgeny Primakov, the hard-line
foreign minister whose candidacy has also been promoted by Gregory
Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko Party.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, however, was not to be outdone in disclaiming any
interest in higher office. Tuesday afternoon he issued a statement
stressing how happy he was in his current job and asserting that he
had not encouraged Yavlinsky to propose him as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot consent to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The canny foreign minister, however, seemed to leave the door
open a crack. ``It is my consistent belief,'' he said, ``that a way
must be found out of the current political crisis within the
shortest possible time by means of consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, who has been waging
an entirely unsubtle campaign to position himself as a likely
successor to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov raised eyebrows the other day by criticizing
Chernomyrdin. But Tuesday he insisted that he had not talked to
Yeltsin about taking Chernomyrdin's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am already head of the Moscow government,'' he said. ``Isn't
that enough?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Moscow speculated about just who might be nominated,
Chernomyrdin sought to demonstrate that it was too soon to write
his political obituary.
</P>
<P>
   His aides Tuesday issued a blizzard of decrees and statements
intended to show that their man was on the job and in control.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, they announced, had signed decrees on customs
duties, bank policy and personnel. He ordered a reduction of the
excise tax on oil production, a measure dearly sought by the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Chernomyrdin has signed 67 resolutions and 58
directives since he was appointed acting prime minister last month,
his spokesman boasted.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's leaders jockeyed for power, however, the economic
collapse continued. The exchange rate slipped to 23 rubles to the
dollar, a far cry from the rate of 6.2 rubles in mid-August. There
was talk of postponing the last major privatization of a state oil
company for lack of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave of Kaliningrad declared a state of emergency.
Workers struck in the closed nuclear cities of Chelyabinsk and
Arzamus over wage arrears and even picketed in front of the Atomic
Energy Ministry building in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As the politicians caught their breath before another round of
wrangling and intrigue, even they agreed Russia would pay a heavy
price for allowing the political circus to go on for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to calculate the budget in these
conditions,'' said Aleksandr Zhukov, the chairman of the
parliament's budget committee. ``If in the next three to four days
the situation with the prime minister is not resolved, the economic
conditions will deteriorate and it will be very difficult to get
out of the economic whirlpool.''

MEXICAN CONSUMERS DENIED CAR LOANS, MORTGAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Inside the lobby at Taxquena Motors Tuesday, &UR;  &LR; four
new Volkswagens sat like sparkling jewels behind a panel of
floor-to-ceiling windows. And a half-dozen salesmen paced the
white-tiled floor waiting for anyone to come in and take a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   But there were hardly any takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of demand for our cars,'' said one salesman who
was back at his desk trying to keep busy. ``But it's hard to get
credit these days and the interest rates are incredibly high.''
</P>
<P>
   In an early sign that the anxieties sweeping across Latin
American markets are &UR;  &LR;  affecting the lives of ordinary citizens,
volatile interest rates have forced several Mexican banks to
temporarily stop lending money to borrowers for mortgages and cars.
Many car dealers and manufacturers have also suspended most of
their financing and leasing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's biggest banks announced on Friday that
they were halting most of their consumer credit programs because of
rapidly rising interest rates and a plummeting currency. Late last
week, the Mexican peso hit a record 10.2 to the dollar, and
short-term interbank interest rates surged to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory G. Tallas, director general of First Chicago Bank
Mexico, attributed the tighter credit policies to the losses many
Mexican banks have suffered recently in mutual fund investments,
particularly in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses on the market have hit the banks' capital ratios,
leaving these guys in tough shape,'' Tallas said. ``This is
affecting the amount of money they can lend to business enterprises
and the amount of credit available for the average Joe in the
street is completely dried up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of credit depends on the (stock) market,'' said
Yolanda Miranda, a Mexico City branch manager for Inverlat Bank.
``We don't know how long this could last because at this moment we
don't have a strong market. It could last months.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks' decisions affect nearly all consumer loans for buying
homes, cars, personal computers, televisions and stereos. It will
also make it harder for businesses to secure lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bancomer and Banamex, two of Mexico's largest banks, said they
suspended credit as an ``act of responsibility.'' Bancomer will not
issue new credit cards during &UR;  &LR; September and those who already hold
cards will see increases in their annual interest rates of between
15 and 20 percent, said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining credit is generally more difficult and more expensive
in Mexico and other Latin American countries than in the United
States. Car financing programs typically require a minimum down
payment of 35 percent to 40 percent with monthly installments
stretched out over just two to three years. Bank-issued credit
cards carry annual interest rates ranging anywhere from 35 percent
to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most bank officials said they would loosen their credit policies
when interest rates stabilized and demand for new loans went up
again. Meanwhile, as concerns have grown over rising interest
rates, so have warnings from government officials and radio and
television announcers who tell Mexican citizens not to accumulate
too much debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the banks came only two days after Mexico's finance
minister, Jose Angel Gurria, joined his Latin American counterparts
last week in stressing that their economies are sound. After
meeting with officials from the International Monetary Fund in
Washington, D.C., Gurria said that recent drops in Latin American
stock markets were the result of overreaction by investors.
</P>
<P>
   But a survey released Monday by the Bank of Mexico shows that
confidence in the economy among analysts &UR;  &LR; has fallen dramatically
over the last month. Only 17 percent of the analysts surveyed by
the central bank in August had a favorable outlook for the economy,
compared with 77 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican banks are not alone in tightening their credit policies.
The Buenos Aires newspaper Clarin reported Monday that most
Argentine banks have also suspended new construction loans because
of the country's dwindling cash supply as investors have fled that
economy.

LONG-TERM TREASURIES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the stock market soaring on the possibility of
an interest- rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the price of
long-term Treasury securities dropped significantly and shorter
maturities were down a little Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds have been strong lately as investors fled the turmoil in
global stock markets, but that appears to have changed since the
chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, said on Friday that the Fed
might consider lowering interest rates if the global financial
crisis continued to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., interpreted
Greenspan's remarks as positive confirmation for eventual Fed
easing of the current 5.5 percent federal funds rate, which banks
charge each other for overnight loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, he strongly implied that at its last Federal
Open Market Committee meeting on Aug. 18 the Fed probably abandoned
its policy directive with a tightening bias in favor of an unbiased
directive, a leading indicator of past easing at the Greenspan
Fed,'' he said. He also cited benign labor costs, which has been
one of Paine Webber's key markers for eventual Fed easing.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 6/32, to 102
2/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, increased to 5.36 percent, from 5.28 percent on Friday.
The nation's markets were closed on Monday in observance of the
Labor Day holiday. For investors the loss amounted to about $11.88
per $1,000 of bonds held.

SPORTS COLUMN: SIMPLY RECALLING MR. MARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing. Column appeared Sept. 6.)  (th) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Maris was not a subtle man but he might have appreciated
some of the nuances of the current home run derby, particularly the
controversy over Mark McGwire's use of testosterone-boosting pills
and the second-banana status of Sammy Sosa. As a decent man, Maris
would not have wished the Curse of the Bambino on the next home run
king, although he would have appreciated having it finally lifted
from his own crew-cut head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wonder what my baseball career would have been had I
not hit the 61,'' Maris said in 1984, a year before he died.
``Because after that point, it was no fun anymore. It's not even
fun to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him why he was talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful, earnest, he nodded and said: ``You know, there's
going to be other kids who will go into the game like I went into
the game, thinking you're going to get credit for what you do. I
think a lot of times how much nicer things could have been if I got
a fair shake. But this is the real side, and there's a lot of kids
that can learn from this. You got to have a tough skin if you want
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The villain in his story was ``the media,'' which made him ``a
whipping boy,'' for not being Mickey Mantle. Like Sosa, Maris was
swinging in the shadow of a designated hero. Mantle, only three
years older than Maris but by then a Yankee for 10 years, was
supposed to finally fulfill his promise as heir to Babe Ruth and
Joe DiMaggio. Maris, who had been touted as ``a future Mickey
Mantle'' when he came up with Cleveland in 1957, became a Yankee
three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the glorious 1960 season, he hit 39 homers to Mantle's
league-leading 40 and was voted most valuable player as the
so-called M&AMP;M boys led the Yankees to the pennant. In those days,
fans booed Mantle and cheered Maris, who thought life could only
get better. And it did, at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, '61 was an easy season,'' Maris said. ``It was fun.
It was exciting. How could it not be?'' At 26, Maris was a complete
ballplayer and a cooperative if colorless interviewee. He just
wasn't as glamorous as the country-slick Mantle, whose mean streak
and unprofessional life style were rarely acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The writers dismissed Maris as ``unworthy'' of wearing the
``Ruthian'' crown. Commissioner Ford Frick, a former sportswriter
who had been the Babe's chief ghost, announced that any record
broken beyond the 154 games of Ruth's schedule would bear a
notation.
</P>
<P>
   Was he protecting his own legacy as well as Ruth's? Whatever the
reason, Maris wore the so-called asterisk like a scarlet letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bitters me up,'' he said 23 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that has seen so many performance-enhancing and
diminishing changes, including movable outfield walls, night games,
jet travel, expansion, improved bats and balls, not to mention such
chemical advances as androstenedione, the asterisk seems silly. One
could as easily be affixed to McGwire's final number.
</P>
<P>
   By 1962, Maris' career was joyless. He hated the winter banquet
circuit that took him away from his wife and children, and he began
responding sourly to ``rips'' in print. He was steaming from such
criticism when he blew off a spring training interview with Jimmy
Cannon. The dyspeptic columnist then wrote that Maris was ``a
whiner'' and ``a thrilling freak'' and implied, incorrectly, that
Mantle was now disgusted with him.
</P>
<P>
   This gave permission to writers around the league to vent their
anti-Maris or anti-Yankee or anti-superstar rage, which, said
Maris, ``spread like the old cancer.'' Fans punctuated the stories
by throwing chairs, nuts and bolts, empty bottles at the
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drove me into something of a shell,'' Maris said. ``I just
didn't enjoy being at the ball park like I did. It was very
difficult every day to say, `Well, here we go again.' I mean, it
was almost like going into a snake pit. It's sort of interesting
though, with the reputation the media gave me over the years,
people are afraid of me before they meet me. And then, after
awhile, they say, `I just can't believe you're anything like you
are.' And that's gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   This was at his beer distributorship in Gainesville, Fla., over
several days of interviewing for the CBS Sunday morning show with
Charles Kuralt. While he told the producer Kathy Sulkes and me that
his lymphatic cancer was in remission and that his prognosis was
hopeful, there was the sense that he wanted to set the record
straight while he could. The Maris of those days was affable and
wry, obviously happy in the cocoon of a warm family.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' office walls were a reflection of his nostalgic
priorities. All the baseball photographs, including the famous shot
of the 61st swing, were behind his back, visible to visitors. He
faced his future, pictures of him swinging a golf club with family
members, customers, old Yankees, politicians. It was not a long
future; he was 51 when he died. Roger the whiner had waited five
years before sharing his symptoms with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who treated him shabbily are gone, but so are
many of the people who might be motivated to make amends. That
Roger Maris belongs in baseball's Hall of Fame is too obvious to
belabor. This season's carnival proves that breaking the record _
and it is still Babe Ruth's record in most minds _ is qualification
enough.
</P>
<P>
   What a good time to give a decent man credit and a fair shake. &QL;

MOWLAM WELCOMES BC EFFORT TO ASSIST NORTHERN IRELAND LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than two decades have elapsed since Northern
Ireland had a parliament.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that many of the 108 elected members of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly, a cornerstone of the Good Friday
peace agreement, have had no experience as legislators.
</P>
<P>
   To help prepare them for the task ahead of them, Boston
College's Irish Institute this fall and next year will hold a
series of comprehensive seminars in Boston for assembly members
from all eight Northern Ireland's political parties, as well as
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to very positive outcomes,'' said Mo
Mowlam, the British minister for Northern Ireland who was at the
college Tuesday for the launching of the political leadership
program. ``It enables people to be together and that trust and
confidence are central'' to making the peace agreement work.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland was placed under direct British rule in 1972,
after its parliament collapsed amid rioting and sectarian violence
by the Irish Republican Army and Loyalist groups. Earlier this
year, voters in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
approved a historic peace accord calling for the creation of an
assembly, which for the first time would include leaders of Sinn
Fein, the political arm of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Landry, chairman of BC's political science department, will
travel to Northern Ireland late next month to brief assembly
members on the upcoming seminars in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Landry said Tuesday that until recently, the political parties
have been accustomed to dealing with each other primarily on a
``conflictual'' and ``symbolic'' level.
</P>
<P>
   The seminars, Landry said, will help assembly members make the
transition to ``nuts and bolts'' legislative governance.
</P>
<P>
   This fall's programs will include meetings with Massachusetts
legislators and city councilors and the use of projects such as the
Deer Island sewage treatment plant as case studies in effective
government.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, seminars will focus primarily on specific topics such
as education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The program at BC, initiated by Mowlam, is being funded by BC
and the United States Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes as an IRA splinter group, which has claimed
responsibility for the Aug. 15 car bombing in Omagh that killed 29
people and wounded more than 330, called for a complete cease fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam Tuesday said she was suspicious of the cease fire call by
the the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad it had to happen after Omagh rather than before,''
said Mowlam. ``We will need alot more evidence than what has been
said in the last 24 hours'' to believe the Real IRA is sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the carnage they have brought, Mowlam asserted that
``evil'' splinter groups such as the Real IRA would fail in their
attempts to sabotage the peace agreement because the people of
Northern Ireland want the accord to work.
</P>
<P>
   During her three-day stay in Boston, Mowlam was also laying the
groundwork for a 11-city tour in the United States next month to
woo investors for Northern Ireland. Jobs, she said, would help
cement the peace process.

CASTING AN EYE ON ARTFUL BOOKS AND ASIAN ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (af) 
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget that books are endangered by the computer and that Asian
art is collected mostly by Asians. Both are on the minds of the
nation's curators, who have assembled some of the strongest and
most diverse selections of such works ever shown in this country.
And both have the power to inspire responses ranging from simmering
excitement to deep serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the pleasures of browsing through the pages of
century-old maps of America in the atlases that will go on view in
October at the New York Public Library, or perusing the zany
comic-strip images and revealing portraits in the late 20th-century
books that will be shown in November at the Museum of Contemporary
Art in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And a rare opportunity awaits the bibliophile in each of us when
one of the world's great medieval manuscripts, the lavishly
illustrated ``Housebook,'' goes on view at the National Gallery of
Art in Washington in November. The book was recently unbound, and a
selection of its finest images, 35 sparsely colored pen and ink
drawings ranging from the size of a postcard to that of a miniature
poster, will be the centerpiece of ``Love and War: A Manual for
Life in the Middle Ages.'' (The pages, being shown for the first
time in America, will move in May to the Frick Collection in New
York.)
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-century ``Housebook,'' owned by Count Johannes of
Waldburg-Wolfegg in Germany, presents a starkly different view of
medieval life than the more familiar romanticized reinventions of
the period seen in the Victorian paintings of Edward Burne-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A curious blend of a cookbook and a how-to manual, ``Housebook''
is a veritable encyclopedia of secular life that presents images of
offbeat machines like the first pedal-operated spinning wheel and,
for astrology buffs, personifications of the planets. But most of
the images are of people.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings in ``Housebook'' are refreshingly candid and
occasionally funny, depicting all strata of society. They show men
fishing, mining, jousting, as soldiers and acrobats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most engaging images are those of elegantly dressed
aristocrats dancing, playing cards, flirting and bathing,
juxtaposed with scenes of peasants jitterbugging in the Morris
dance and making love in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The artist, called the Housebook painter, even injects humor
into a traditional view of the Holy Family, showing the Madonna and
Child and Joseph rolling a ball to the baby Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The witty way in which an old story is given a new twist plays
to a contemporary sense of irony. ``The response to these drawings
is not nostalgia but delight,'' said Andrew Robison, a senior
curator at the National Gallery. ``The images make you smile. And
you will not need a magnifying glass to study them.''
</P>
<P>
   In museums and galleries, on the fashion runways of New York and
Paris, in films and in restaurants, Asian artifacts elicit somewhat
different reactions: curiosity and wonder. The more we see them,
the more we are drawn to contemporary objects that reflect ancient
crafts, especially in works from Japan like the baskets coming to
the Asia Society next spring and the computer-designed fabrics
favored by Tokyo's high-fashion houses, which will be seen at the
Museum of Modern Art in November.
</P>
<P>
   But what most of us yearn to see more of these days are the
masterpieces _ centuries-old works from Asian lands, the types of
bronzes, porcelains, jades, lacquerwares and furniture that once
adorned temples and palaces throughout the East.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly though, Chinese furniture, one of the most influential
areas of Asian decorative arts, has been underrepresented in
American and European museums.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is trying to correct that
oversight in the most ambitious exhibition of Ming and Ching
furniture ever held in this country. The show is installed in the
museum's new Asian art complex of 22 galleries, which will have its
grand opening on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the show are two glorious architectural treasures:
a soaring 17th-century reception hall from a Ming mansion and a
lattice-framed 18th-century scholar's study with an adjoining rock
garden. Both were brought from China _ eaves and all _ and
painstakingly reassembled in two galleries in the new complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk into the Ming room and your blood pressure drops,''
said Robert D. Jacobsen, the museum's Asian-art curator. ``It's a
calming, centering experience to be in there.''

BOSTON MINISTER TAKES OATH AS AMBASSADOR TO TANZANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Massachusetts neighborhoods converged in a
gold-toned reception room overlooking the capital Tuesday as the
Rev. Charles R. Stith was sworn in as US ambassador to Tanzania
with pledges to increase trade and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was tinged by somber reminders that Monday marked
one month since the twin bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya. At the opening of his speech, Stith read the names of the 10
embassy employees, all Tanzanians, who were killed in the Dar es
Salaam bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone needed reminders. Outside, in a semi-circular
driveway that has long welcomed visitors to the State Department,
workers Tuesday finished installing 26 metal posts to keep out
cars. To add another layer of protection, the driveway was also
blocked by three government-owned Dodge Ram trucks, so new that the
price stickers were still on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the State Department, on once-bustling
Virginia Avenue, police waved away cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's determination to go to his post and supervise the
reconstruction of the embassy is a sign ``the United States will
not let terrorism scare us away from protecting out interests
overseas,'' said Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bombings, which killed 263 people and wounded
more than 5,000, Stith said, ``We were devastated by the loss, but
let the message go forth. ... We will never be intimidated by
terrorist thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him stood Edith Bartley, 25, an American whose father and
brother were killed in the Kenya explosion, and to his side was
John Lang, the top-ranking State Department official, who
coordinated the rescue effort in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombings, career diplomats considered Tanzania a
quiet, out-of-the way posting. The country of 29 million is a
democracy with free elections and a government that echoes
Washington's talk of free trade. Stith, though, will have the added
duties of overseeing reconstruction of the embassy and repairs on
the ambassador's residence while consulting with the FBI and other
agencies on the bombing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a rousing speech to nearly 400 friends _ mostly from Boston's
religious, academic and business communities _ Stith spoke about
the path from the segregated St. Louis neighborhood where he grew
up to his new assignment in East Africa as a US diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have risen from the cusp of poverty to become a
representative of this country and an adviser to its president is
an honor, and it is humbling,'' Stith said to applause in the
ornate Benjamin Franlin room atop the State Department. The
late-afternoon swearing-in ceremony had the air of a testimonial
dinner. The audience included retired Superior Court Judge Harry J.
Elam, former Boston schools superintendent Robert ``Bud'' Spillane,
Oak Bluff's Police Chief Joseph Carter, and Harvard University
professor Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bombings, the job in Tanzania ``is no longer a
pretty inconspicuous post,'' said Roxbury District Court Judge
Edward R. Redd. ``It's going to require extra vigilance and extra
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith will be joined in Tanzania by his wife, Deborah
Prothrow-Stith, an associate dean at Harvard's School of Public

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The American Embassy here was an easy target
for terrorists. Its perimeter was patrolled by unarmed guards
earning about $100 a month. The embassy's parking lot, shared with
a local bank, had an exit lane protected by neither guards nor
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   On August 7, attackers driving a truck packed with explosives
turned off Haile Selassie Avenue and roared up that road, flashing
past an uninstalled security barrier that the local bank was
planning to erect to protect the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The truck reached the edge of the building, where it was
confronted by several unarmed private security guards, who
scattered after the attackers threw a grenade-like device at them.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of the Nairobi bombing, based on interviews
with guards and other witnesses, shows that the embassy was left
vulnerable to the most rudimentary attack.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the State Department vowed to tighten the
security of its embassies around the world, the interviews show
that the Nairobi post had failed to achieve a basic aspect of
security: control of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And Nairobi is not alone. An administration official in
Washington said it was common for embassies to be near private
property with security precautions left to the local owners. In
Malaysia, the embassy was next door to a gas station. After the
bombings in Africa, the official said, the U.S. government bought
the gas station and immediately emptied its tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a typical problem for us,'' the official said. ``We
have a number of situations in which we share commercial parking
lots.''
</P>
<P>
   The House International Relations Committee plans to hold
hearings later this month on the embassy bombings, and will examine
a number of security issues, including why the exit lane was left
vulnerable to terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 18 months, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence
Bushnell, repeatedly complained to her superiors in Washington
about the lack of security at her embassy, and the committee wants
to know whether she specifically raised questions about access to
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said the embassy in Nairobi did not
request any money to secure the road leading out of the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it would have made a difference,'' said one embassy
official, who like most of the U.S. officials interviewed for this
article spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``If we had had
control of that outside parking lot and more guardposts, they would
have gone somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. embassies around the world employ unarmed guards from
private security companies rather than armed guards or soldiers to
handle day-to-day security outside the building. U.S. Marines
normally control access to embassy buildings and protect classified
documents, and handle security problems within the embassy itself.
But external security is often handled by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion here on Aug. 7, U.S. officials initially
praised the guard company, United International Investigative
Services, which is based in Anaheim, Calif. The officials pointed
out that the two Kenyan guards at the rear gate of the embassy's
underground garage had refused to allow the van carrying the bomb
to enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vehicle had gotten down that parking ramp, none of us
would be talking to you,'' said one high-ranking embassy official.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial praise for the guards, who all survived the
blast, did not address why the terrorists had such an easy time
driving up to the barrier at the top of the ramp leading into the
embassy garage, coming close enough to gut the embassy building and
kill three dozen people inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to several witnesses, the Mitsubishi Canter van
carrying the bomb entered the parking lot through an exit lane
leading out to Haile Selassie Avenue. There was no barrier there to
stop the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy shared the rear parking lot with the adjacent
Cooperative Bank, U.S. officials said. The bank employed guards
from Wells Fargo Co., who controlled a barrier at the entrance of
the parking lot 50 yards to the north. The entrance was on an
access road that ran parallel to the avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had hired a contractor to install a cantilevered bar
barrier, like those used at railroad crossings, across the exit
lane, but the work had not yet been completed, U.S. officials said.
The useless barrier was laying on the ground the day of the attack,
several guards said. State Department officials said they had no
plan to build a security barrier controlling access to the rear of
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a barrier, the exit ramp was supposed to be guarded
by one of the embassy's private security guards in the parking lot,
the guards said in interviews. But the guard on duty that day near
the mouth of the exit lane, Jomo Matike Boke, did nothing to stop
the van from entering, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Boke's failure was not surprising, since he was filling in for a
sick colleague and had never performed the assignment before, the
guards said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the bombing, William Guidice, president of
United International Investigative Services, said the truck
carrying the bomb had first tried to enter a parking lot at the
front of the building, claiming to have a delivery for the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Guidice maintained that the guard turned the truck away from the
front lot and told the men inside to go around to the back gate to
make the delivery. The guard, Francis Emomeri, declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI investigators and embassy officials now say they doubt
that story. No witnesses have been found who saw the truck come to
the front of the embassy, law-enforcement officials said, though at
least one witness has told investigators he saw a second car
leading the van toward the embassy before the blast.

MURDOCH MOVE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED UNSETTLES BRITISH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Given that most British people think baseball is an
unfathomable American bastardization of cricket, few here batted an
eye last year when media mogul Rupert Murdoch bought the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Australian-born tycoon has set his sights on
Manchester United, England's most famous and financially successful
soccer team, all hell has broken loose. It is suddenly the biggest
story in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things that arouse the passions of the English
like soccer, or what they call football. But one thing that comes
close is anything that the ambitious, controversial tycoon touches.
Put together, soccer and Murdoch are a volatile mix, politically
and culturally, in England and the rest of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Murdoch's BSkyB cable network confirmed that it was
trying to buy venerable Man United, an announcement that sent the
team's stock value soaring about $190 million in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged fans plan to picket at Wednesday night's game at Old
Trafford, Man United's hallowed stadium. They are convinced that
Murdoch wants to corner the television market on the team, making
its games exclusive to his cable network, which already has a
virtual monopoly on Premier League games. As Sky prepares to launch
a 200-channel digital network, landing the games of the New York
Yankees of English soccer would be an enticing lure for potential
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's initial offer of about $900 million for the team has
spawned interest from other corporations, including Enic, an
entertainment conglomerate which has financial backing from the US
giant Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Man United fans who are lamenting the bidding war
that Murdoch has started. Fans of the 19 other Premier League clubs
fear that if Murdoch acquires the team, his network will show Man
United games at the exclusion of others.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer fans here take their game seriously, and consider it
beneath the purely bottom-line thinking that dominates most
professional sports in the rest of Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing fear that soccer, one of the few things that
provides common ground for all classes and races in a society often
divided by class and race, will become just another commodity to be
bought and sold by the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in his shop in North London, Nick Marcos, an elderly
tailor, shrugged as he bemoaned the growing commercialization of a
game he played as a child in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money today,'' he said. ``The game has become
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the threat that Murdoch's sudden interest in Man United
poses to English football, it refocuses attention on the
relationship between Murdoch and British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
whose government must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since his May 1997 landslide election, Blair has enjoyed an
extended honeymoon with the press, especially Murdoch's holdings.
But Blair's alleged coziness with Murdoch continues to surface as a
sore point, a welcome development for political opponents who have
little else to beat him up with.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of that, Blair's closest adviser, Peter Mandelson, the
trade and industry secretary who can approve or veto the deal,
swiftly announced that Murdoch's bid would be given intense
scrutiny to make sure it does not pose an undue threat to
consumers. Fans are not reassured by Mandelson's close friendship
with Murdoch's daughter, Elisabeth, Sky's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say there is probably little the government can do to
stop Murdoch from buying Man United, but politically it must be
seen to be doing all it can to stop him. If the government blocks
Murdoch, it will score points with fans everywhere but risk
incurring the wrath of Murdoch's extensive media empire.
</P>
<P>
   All this bother over a soccer team leaves some people puzzled.
As London's Evening Standard observed in an editorial, ``It says
much about national priorities that there has been far more public
anguish about Mr. Rupert Murdoch's threatened bid for Manchester
United than ever there was about the creation of his dominant media
empire in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch controls about 40 percent of the British media, from
racy tabloids that showcase naked women to the more upmarket
broadsheet, The Times of London. If he succeeds in his latest
acquisition bid, he will own just one soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   But, for millions of people, it's the only team that matters.

 NAIROBI, Kenya: the blast. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is certain is that the van was headed east on Haile
Selassie Avenue when it abruptly made a hard left turn, bounced
over a curb, then slipped through the exit lane and into the
parking lot, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Benson Okuku Bwaku was the guard manning the barrier leading
into the underground garage. He said he saw the 3.5-ton Mitsubishi
Canter truck with a covered cargo bay turn off the avenue and speed
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier was up, Okuku Bwaku said, because he had just
allowed a three-wheeled mail cart, driven by an embassy worker
named Francis Kile, to pass out of the embassy's garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel something in my blood that the van was unusual,''
he recalled. ``I asked Kile to move his cart quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck would have reached the barrier in seconds had a white
sedan not pulled out of another parking garage under the
Cooperative Bank Building across the lot from the embassy, he said.
The sedan ended up nose to nose with the van and for a minute
neither could move.
</P>
<P>
   Okuku Bwaku said he saw a man jump from the passenger side of
the van. Feeling panicked, the guard pushed the barrier down and
fastened it to the post. When he looked up, the man was next to
him, about six feet away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was black-skinned with Arab features, long sideburns and
fine, straight black hair that hung down to the middle of his neck,
the guard said. He wore a plaid shirt and grey, denim cargo pants
with large pockets on the thighs. His hands were in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said was: `Open the gate.' Not loud. Not soft,'' Okuku
Bwaku recalled. ``I did not talk to him. The barrier was down. He
pulled his hands out of his pockets. In his left hand he had what
looked like a hand grenade. In his right hand he had three objects
with three strings falling from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The man hurled the grenade-like device at Okuku Bwaku's head
with his left hand, the guard said. He ducked. The grenade landed a
few yards behind him and exploded near a car in the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Okuku Bwaku ran about 25 feet toward Haile Selassie Avenue and
stopped. He said he desperately tried to radio the Marine guard at
post one, a bulletproof control room in the reception area of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break! Base! Terrorism! Terrorism!'' he said he shouted into
the radio. The attacker threw a second device at him. It sailed
over him and exploded in a paved plaza surrounding the embassy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the drop barrier there was an iron fence and a pair of
heavy steel gates, through which cars had to pass to enter the
garage. As Okuku Bwaku ran toward the avenue, a second guard, Joash
Okindo, locked the steel gates with a padlock. He was critically
injured in the blast that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the embassy, Cpl. Samuel Gonite was on guard in the post
one control room. Like the other six Marines at the embassy that
day, he declined through a military spokeswoman to be interviewed
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokeswoman, Maj. Mary Baldwin, said the corporal was
not aware of the fracas at the back gate until the first grenade
exploded. She said he immediately checked the monitors connected to
cameras on the roof but saw nothing unusual. He told his superiors
he looked outside to see if the noise might have been a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Baldwin said the corporal was trying to make one of the
roof-top cameras pan around to the rear parking lot when the second
car bomb exploded. He either did not receive or did not hear Okuku
Bwaku's frantic radio transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, his focus was not on the radio, but on getting
the embassy secure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Okuku Bwaku was running for his life. He ran around the
corner of the embassy, intending, he says, to sprint to the
post-one control room and alert the Marines. He had gone about 15
yards when the car bomb exploded, sending him flying to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Baldwin said Gonite recalled a 10-second delay between the
first grenade and the big explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A seismograph at the University of Nairobi Geology Department
registered a small tremor at 10:39 and 20 seconds. Eight seconds
later, it registered a shockwave from the explosion that measured
3.4 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   Though Okuku Bwaku never saw the truck move closer to the
parking lot ramp, another guard on duty nearby did.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, who asked not to be identified, said he was standing
near the outlet ramp of the parking lot, when the delivery truck
made a sharp turn off Haile Selassie and into the parking lot,
moving fast.
</P>
<P>
   He described the truck as a late model, cream-colored one with a
Dubai license plate on the back fender. He saw the truck squeeze
past the sedan and approach the barrier just after the man who had
leaped from the passenger side threw a grenade at Okuku Bwaku.
Law-enforcement officials say the driver of the truck was killed in
the explosion. It is unclear how many other terrorists were present
when the bomb went off or how many were involved in the bombing
conspiracy, they said. Some witnesses have reported seeing another
man climb out of the back of the van.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Richardson, a former military policeman who is one of
the partners in the guard company, said the guards receive about 80
hours of classroom training and 40 hours of practical training
before being put on the job. The company also gives frequent
refresher courses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach them about terrorism and the things they should look
for,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson acknowledged it was virtually impossible for
unarmed guards to stop armed men from driving a car filled with
explosives up to the rear of the embassy, especially given the lack
of physical barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in that location,'' he said. ``You get very little
forewarning about what's taking place or what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that particular area, with unarmed security officers, it's
hard to protect something like that, or even to put a lot of fear
into anyone,'' he added.

 NAIROBI, Kenya: he added. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richardson said he and his partners had applied for permission
to start an armed-guard service last year, but the Kenyan
government had turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said it would have been possible to employ
armed guards at the embassy _ several banks in the neighborhood do
_ but until the attack last month, the potential threat to the
embassy did not seem high enough to warrant armed patrols.
</P>
<P>
   A security official at the embassy, who asked not to be
identified, said even with better-trained guards, the embassy would
be difficult to protect because of its location.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story chancery sits at the corner of the city's two
busiest avenues and heavy pedestrian traffic flows around it
constantly, like water over a stone in a creek.
</P>
<P>
   The building has precious little setback on any side, and the
parking lots at the front and rear come up within a few meters of
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location of that building from a security standpoint is a
nightmare,'' the official said. ``It should have been moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said the U.S. ambassador, Ms. Bushnell,
renewed her complaints several times about the lack of security,
recommending at least twice in writing that the chancery be moved
to a new location.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year and a half that she's been here she's been
fighting with Washington to get us out of that building,'' a close
aide to Ms. Bushnell said. But the answer came back from Washington
that there was no money available for a new embassy, and the old
building would be remodeled instead, embassy officials said. It
remains unclear whether the security system in the rear parking lot
was to have been changed in the planned renovation, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't anything that wasn't brought to Washington's
attention,'' another embassy official said. ``They told us to be
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, several guards from the United International
Investigative Services said they had not received adequate training
to counter a terrorist attack like the one on August 7.
</P>
<P>
   Some said their training had lasted only two weeks, rather than
a month as Richardson maintained. Bombs were covered, they said,
but only in a cursory way. In essence, they were taught to clear
the area when a suspicious package or suspected bomb is found, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   First hired in November 1996, the company receives about $1
million a year from the State Department to provide full-time
security at the embassy and about 180 official residences. The
contract requires 540 guards, who make about $83 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to live in slums without water or electricity, several
guards said the salary did not encourage them to risk their live
for the embassy, they said. What's more, their salaries were cut
recently, along with health benefits for their families and a daily
meal allowance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are getting is too little,'' said one guard, who asked
not to be named.

MEXICAN CONSUMERS DENIED CAR LOANS, MORTGAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Inside the lobby at Taxquena Motors Tuesday, &UR;  &LR; four
new Volkswagens sat like sparkling jewels behind a panel of
floor-to-ceiling windows. And a half-dozen salesmen paced the
white-tiled floor waiting for anyone to come in and take a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   But there were hardly any takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of demand for our cars,'' said one salesman who
was back at his desk trying to keep busy. ``But it's hard to get
credit these days and the interest rates are incredibly high.''
</P>
<P>
   In an early sign that the anxieties sweeping across Latin
American markets are &UR;  &LR;  affecting the lives of ordinary citizens,
volatile interest rates have forced several Mexican banks to
temporarily stop lending money to borrowers for mortgages and cars.
Many car dealers and manufacturers have also suspended most of
their financing and leasing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's biggest banks announced on Friday that
they were halting most of their consumer credit programs because of
rapidly rising interest rates and a plummeting currency. Late last
week, the Mexican peso hit a record 10.2 to the dollar, and
short-term interbank interest rates surged to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory G. Tallas, director general of First Chicago Bank
Mexico, attributed the tighter credit policies to the losses many
Mexican banks have suffered recently in mutual fund investments,
particularly in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses on the market have hit the banks' capital ratios,
leaving these guys in tough shape,'' Tallas said. ``This is
affecting the amount of money they can lend to business enterprises
and the amount of credit available for the average Joe in the
street is completely dried up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of credit depends on the (stock) market,'' said
Yolanda Miranda, a Mexico City branch manager for Inverlat Bank.
``We don't know how long this could last because at this moment we
don't have a strong market. It could last months.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks' decisions affect nearly all consumer loans for buying
homes, cars, personal computers, televisions and stereos. It will
also make it harder for businesses to secure lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bancomer and Banamex, two of Mexico's largest banks, said they
suspended credit as an ``act of responsibility.'' Bancomer will not
issue new credit cards during &UR;  &LR; September and those who already hold
cards will see increases in their annual interest rates of between
15 and 20 percent, said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining credit is generally more difficult and more expensive
in Mexico and other Latin American countries than in the United
States. Car financing programs typically require a minimum down
payment of 35 percent to 40 percent with monthly installments
stretched out over just two to three years. Bank-issued credit
cards carry annual interest rates ranging anywhere from 35 percent
to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most bank officials said they would loosen their credit policies
when interest rates stabilized and demand for new loans went up
again. Meanwhile, as concerns have grown over rising interest
rates, so have warnings from government officials and radio and
television announcers who tell Mexican citizens not to accumulate
too much debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the banks came only two days after Mexico's finance
minister, Jose Angel Gurria, joined his Latin American counterparts
last week in stressing that their economies are sound. After
meeting with officials from the International Monetary Fund in
Washington, D.C., Gurria said that recent drops in Latin American
stock markets were the result of overreaction by investors.

   But a survey released Monday by the Bank of Mexico shows that
confidence in the economy among analysts &UR;  &LR; has fallen dramatically
over the last month. Only 17 percent of the analysts surveyed by
the central bank in August had a favorable outlook for the economy,
compared with 77 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican banks are not alone in tightening their credit policies.
The Buenos Aires newspaper Clarin reported Monday that most
Argentine banks have also suspended new construction loans because
of the country's dwindling cash supply as investors have fled that
economy.

BOSTON MINISTER TAKES OATH AS AMBASSADOR TO TANZANIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Massachusetts neighborhoods converged in a
gold-toned reception room overlooking the capital Tuesday as the
Rev. Charles R. Stith was sworn in as US ambassador to Tanzania
with pledges to increase trade and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was tinged by somber reminders that Monday marked
one month since the twin bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya. At the opening of his speech, Stith read the names of the 10
embassy employees, all Tanzanians, who were killed in the Dar es
Salaam bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone needed reminders. Outside, in a semi-circular
driveway that has long welcomed visitors to the State Department,
workers Tuesday finished installing 26 metal posts to keep out
cars. To add another layer of protection, the driveway was also
blocked by three government-owned Dodge Ram trucks, so new that the
price stickers were still on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the State Department, on once-bustling
Virginia Avenue, police waved away cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's determination to go to his post and supervise the
reconstruction of the embassy is a sign ``the United States will
not let terrorism scare us away from protecting out interests
overseas,'' said Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bombings, which killed 263 people and wounded
more than 5,000, Stith said, ``We were devastated by the loss, but
let the message go forth. ... We will never be intimidated by
terrorist thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him stood Edith Bartley, 25, an American whose father and
brother were killed in the Kenya explosion, and to his side was
John Lang, the top-ranking State Department official, who
coordinated the rescue effort in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombings, career diplomats considered Tanzania a
quiet, out-of-the way posting. The country of 29 million is a
democracy with free elections and a government that echoes
Washington's talk of free trade. Stith, though, will have the added
duties of overseeing reconstruction of the embassy and repairs on
the ambassador's residence while consulting with the FBI and other
agencies on the bombing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a rousing speech to nearly 400 friends _ mostly from Boston's
religious, academic and business communities _ Stith spoke about
the path from the segregated St. Louis neighborhood where he grew
up to his new assignment in East Africa as a US diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have risen from the cusp of poverty to become a
representative of this country and an adviser to its president is
an honor, and it is humbling,'' Stith said to applause in the
ornate Benjamin Franlin room atop the State Department. The
late-afternoon swearing-in ceremony had the air of a testimonial
dinner. The audience included retired Superior Court Judge Harry J.
Elam, former Boston schools superintendent Robert ``Bud'' Spillane,
Oak Bluff's Police Chief Joseph Carter, and Harvard University
professor Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bombings, the job in Tanzania ``is no longer a
pretty inconspicuous post,'' said Roxbury District Court Judge
Edward R. Redd. ``It's going to require extra vigilance and extra
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith will be joined in Tanzania by his wife, Deborah
Prothrow-Stith, an associate dean at Harvard's School of Public
Health; their son Percy; their daughter Mildred, known as ``Mimi,''
and his mother-in-law, Mildred Prothrow, 80, who has plans to
volunteer at a school or hospital..
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing tapes to learn how to speak Swahili _ not that
I've learned anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Percy, 19, will take a year off from Bates College to work for
his father at the embassy. ``After the bombing, I had some friends
in college ask me, `Do still want to go there?' '' he said. ``We
definitely do.''

AMID FISCAL CRISIS, NO INTEREST IN PRIME MINISTER'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Wanted: Russian prime minister nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Job description: Save country from certain collapse. Applicant
must be aging former Soviet Communist Party member. Relevant work
experience a plus.
</P>
<P>
   With its economy unravelling by the day, its currency falling
fast, and its outlying regions growing increasingly restive over
the power vacuum in Moscow, Russia badly needs a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seems to want the job of putting one together except
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the acting prime minister whose nomination
by President Boris N. Yeltsin was emphatically rejected a second
time by lawmakers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, three men whom the Communist-dominated State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, would rather see as premier _ acting
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, and
Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the upper house of parliament _ all said
thanks, but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. As the ruble dropped another 10 percent
to 20.82 to the dollar amid soaring prices, panic-buying, and
growing shortages in stores, several Russian regions announced they
would try to tackle the crisis on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Kaliningrad, a tiny Russian enclave tucked between Poland and
Lithuania, Governor Leonid Gorbenko declared a ``state of
emergency'' that amounted to an effort to control prices and
restrict hoarding. Siberia's Omsk province has announced strict
price controls of its own, as has the tiny semi-autonomous ethnic
Republic of Chuvashia on the river Volga, home to 1.2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, an interim government spokesman said Russia had
plenty of food stocked up. But Russia looks increasingly likely to
default on its foreign debt obligations, which would make it harder
than it already is for Russian firms to get letters of credit to
buy products abroad. The food imports upon which the country
depends for an estimated 50 to 75 percent of its diet have dried
up. The only things in ample supply are dire predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis is very dangerous,'' said former acting prime
minister Yegor Gaidar, who freed prices in 1992 to kick off
Russia's post-Soviet transformation, as well as the price increases
that drove him out of office in less than a year. Tuesday, Gaidar
predicted a new round of hyperinflation if the government does what
the Duma and most other people in Russia want and prints money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have serious consequences and could end with the
formation of a Nazi regime,'' Gaidar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who replaced Gaidar and was prime minister for
five years before Yeltsin fired him in March, says he can put
Russia together again, but the Duma looks poised to reject him a
third time. That would allow Yeltsin to dismiss the Duma, and push
Russia into a constitutional crisis that would make pulling the
economy out of its tailspin even more impossible than the task
seems now.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma has moved to prevent that from happening. If Yeltsin
reappoints Chernomyrdin, the house will begin impeachment
proceedings, senior lawmakers said Tuesday. While it is difficult
to actually remove the Russian president from office, during an
impeachment investigation Yeltsin would lose his right to dissolve
the Duma _ assuming he decides to obey the rules laid off in
Russia's much trampled-upon 1993 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting darkly that Yeltsin may be considering a military
solution to the standoff, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said
Tuesday that Russia's poorly fed army was not ready to back the
president. Yeltsin ended a power struggle with his parliament in
1993 by sending tanks to shell the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the Duma's stiff resistance to Chernomyrdin has caused
Yeltsin to pause. Tuesday, the Duma waited all day for Yeltsin to
either name a new candidate or reappoint Chernomyrdin. Instead, the
president remained holed up in his suburban residence south of
Moscow, huddling with advisers, according to the Kremlin press
service. As the Duma waited in vain for an answer, its supply of
imported fresh-ground coffee ran out, bringing the crisis home to
the entrenched lower house. Yeltsin is expected to name his
candidate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaidar said Russia now needed a government with ``a clearly
defined reformist reputation'' willing to cut spending, raise and
simplify taxes, and win back battered international confidence,
Reuters reported. Yeltsin forced the Duma to accept a government
like that in April, under Sergei Kiriyenko, the 35-year-old premier
the president sacked after the ruble collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   This time, lawmakers have made it clear they want the next
government led by someone like most of them: aging former Communist
Party officials who reject Gaidar's monetarist solutions to
Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, the 60-year-old mayor of Moscow, fits that bill, and
enjoys a reputation in Russia and abroad as a can-do manager,
thanks to his efforts to clean up Moscow. A lot of people charge
that Luzhkov is a crook, too, but the mayor has fought and won
dozens of libel lawsuits against anyone willing to put that in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov is also openly ambitious, but the job he covets is
Yeltsin's, not Chernomyrdin's. The mayor has been putting together
a formidable war chest, a media empire, and a chauvinistic foreign
policy in preparations for scheduled presidential elections in
2000. But Luzhkov Tuesday denied having ambitions to become prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am already a prime minister _ of the government of Moscow,''
Luzhkov told reporters. ``There are no discussions about that and
none are planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroyev, too, has the sympathies of many Duma members. The
former Soviet Communist Party secretary of Oryol, an agricultural
region 200 miles south of Moscow, Stroyev stayed on as governor
after the Soviet collapse. His 1997 reelection, in which he won
over 95 percent of the vote, was panned as unfair and undemocratic
by most observers, but praised as a victory for reform by Yeltsin.
As the speaker of the upper house of parliament, the Federation
Council, which is made up of regional leaders, Stroyev, 61, has
been a loyal supporter of Yeltsin while talking about things the
Communists like to hear, like the need for greater state support
for agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Stroyev Tuesday declined to be considered for the job of
prime minister, instead offering his support to Primakov, the
acting foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's candidacy was suggested by the reformist leader
Grigory Yavlinsky. This may have come as a surprise to American
commentators who see the gruff 68-year-old Primakov as an
entrenched enemy of the West and Yavlinsky as reform's last best
hope. But in Russia, Primakov is seen as the consummate pragmatist
and a true patriot, and thus one of the few people in the country
who can sign songs from ``West Side Story'' with Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, as the two did in Manila in July, and not be
slammed as a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also Tuesday refused to be considered a candidate,
saying he would gladly accept an invitation to continue as foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate, Communist lawmaker and the former
head of the Soviet State Planning Agency, Yury Maslyukov, was out
of town and presumably out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that none of the prime minister candiates wants to
anger Yeltsin by appearing to want the job too much. Like the czars
he jokingly compares himself to, Yeltsin has set up a system in
which all power is concentrated in his office. Luzhkov, Primakov,
and Stroyev have been careful in recent years to avoid appearing
anything less than loyal supporters. But to do the job of prime
minister, they will need more autonomy than any of their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The key condition any candidate for the job will demand of
Yeltsin, according to former Kremlin political adviser Vyacheslav
Nikonov, is that the president give up some of his power.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Is Yeltsin ready to accept that?

<TEXT>
<P>
   A major new study of the records and experiences of tens of
thousands of students over 20 years at the some of the nation's top
colleges and universities concludes that their affirmative action
policies created the backbone of the black middle class and taught
white classmates the value of integration.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which challenges much of the conservative thinking
about affirmative action, is to be released Wednesday by Princeton
University Press in a book titled ``The Shape of the River:
Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and
University Admissions.'' It was written by two former Ivy League
presidents, William Bowen of Princeton University, an economist,
and Derek Bok of Harvard University, a political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Examining grades, test scores, choice of major, graduation
rates, careers and attitudes of 45,000 students at 28 of the most
selective schools, the authors say that although they are both
advocates of race-conscious admissions policies, they wanted to
test the assumptions underlying such policies.
</P>
<P>
   Having completed the work, they say it should put to rest major
objections to such policies, especially that both whites and blacks
are ultimately cheated by them.
</P>
<P>
   With its rich database and carefully calibrated tone, the study
will most likely lead the charge in a liberal counteroffensive to
recast the debate over affirmative action, which in the last two
years has been rolled back in California and Texas and is under
serious challenge in Michigan and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The counteroffensive, involving books, articles and academic
conferences, seeks to broaden the notion of ``merit'' beyond tests
and grades and hails affirmative action less as a means of
overcoming past discrimination _ an older argument with decreasing
political support _ and more as a way to insure a healthier future
for whites and blacks. Among the other new studies are ``Chilling
Admissions: The Affirmative Action Crisis and the Search for
Alternatives,'' published by the Civil Rights Project of Harvard
University, and ``The Black-White Test Score Gap'' from the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowen-Bok study limits itself to the practice of
race-conscious admissions in elite higher education; that is, to
considering the race of applicants to be a critical factor in
whether they should be admitted, as important as, say, their region
of origin or their extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   The study begins by documenting the problem clearly: blacks who
enter elite institutions do so with lower test scores and grades
than those of whites. And as they work their way through liberal
arts colleges like Yale and Princeton and state schools like the
Universities of Michigan and North Carolina, black students receive
lower grades and graduate at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   But after graduation, the survey found, these students achieve
notable successes. They earn advanced degrees at rates identical to
those of their white classmates. They are even slightly more likely
than whites from the same institutions to obtain professional
degrees in law, business and medicine. And they become more active
than their white classmates in civic and community activities.
</P>
<P>
   The authors call black graduates of elite institutions ``the
backbone of the emergent black middle class'' and say that their
influence extends well beyond the workplace. ``They can serve as
strong threads in a fabric that binds their own community together
and binds those communities into the larger social fabric as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking findings is how much an elite college
education serves as a pathway to success for all races. Blacks who
graduate from elite colleges earn 70 percent to 85 percent more
than do black graduates generally.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites report fairly substantial social interaction
at college, which they say helped them relate to members of
different racial groups later in life. Finally, the more selective
the college, the more likely were blacks who attended it to
graduate, obtain advanced degrees and earn high salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' focus on selective universities illustrates what
they consider an often-ignored point: the debate over
race-conscious admissions is relevant only to about 25 percent of
American universities. The rest take all or nearly all who apply.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok say there are many other facts that have been
overlooked in the debate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, this issue has involved much emotion but little
evidence,'' said Bowen, who is now president of the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation, which sponsored the research. ``When the Supreme
Court decided Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954, it relied
heavily on social science studies. We hope our data influence the
current Supreme Court when it rules on affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent developments show that race-conscious
admissions policies, approved within limits by the Supreme Court in
its splintered 1978 Bakke ruling, are in trouble with the American
public and may face re-examination by the justices.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 Hopwood case, for example, the 5th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals barred the use of race in university admissions,
both public and private, in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of cases, expected to go to trial in mid-1999, challenges
the undergraduate and law school admission systems at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, charging that they give
illegal advantage to black and other minority applicants. In 1996,
California banned the consideration of race in its public
university admissions. In the state of Washington, a similar ban is
up for voter approval in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shape of the River'' draws on data about students who
entered college in 1976 and 1989 and on lengthy follow-up
confidential questionnaires with them. It focuses on blacks because
of the quantity of data available and because blacks have been the
heart of the debate. But the authors say a companion study of
Hispanic students is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of those receiving questionnaires responded. The
database, called College and Beyond, was built by the Mellon
Foundation beginning in late 1994. It provides statistical life
histories as well as personal views of 45,184 individuals on
education and occupation, income, retrospective views of college,
interaction with other races and civic participation.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 institutions involved in the study were Barnard College,
Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, Denison University, Duke
University, Emory University, Hamilton University, Kenyon College,
Miami University (Ohio), Northwestern University, Oberlin College,
Pennsylvania State University, Princeton University, Rice
University, Smith College, Stanford University, Swarthmore College,
Tufts University, Tulane University, the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the
University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, Washington
University, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University, Williams
College and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok say in their book that a ``race-neutral''
admissions policy would be disastrous for American society,
reducing black percentages at top schools to less than 2 percent
from the current 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration of what that would mean, they constructed a
rough profile of 700 black students admitted in 1976 under
race-conscious policies. Of the 700, 225 obtained professional
degrees or doctorates; 70 are now medical doctors, 60 are lawyers,
125 are business executives and more than 300 are civic leaders.
Their average annual earnings are $71,000.
</P>
<P>
   A more troubling question, the authors acknowledge, regards the
white students whom these black students displaced. Would society
have been better off if they had attended instead of the blacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the central question,'' the authors write, ``and it
cannot be answered by data alone.'' It is a clash of ``principle
versus principle, not principle versus expediency.'' They come down
firmly on the side of admitting the blacks, saying that society
needs them because of the scarcity of black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But they added a statistical argument and illustrated it with an
analogy to parking spaces for handicapped drivers drawn from a
forthcoming article by Thomas J. Kane. ``Eliminating the reserved
space would have only a minuscule effect on parking options for
non-disabled drivers,'' Kane writes. ``But the sight of the open
space will frustrate many passing motorists who are looking for a
space. Many are likely to believe that they would now be parked if
the space were not reserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok point out that if more than half of the blacks
accepted at selective colleges had been rejected, the probability
of acceptance for another white applicant would rise only 2
percent, to 27 percent from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, like handicapped parking spaces, race-conscious
admission policies have a major impact on the minority group in
question whereas eliminating them would only marginally help
members of the majority community.
</P>
<P>
   One commonly voiced objection to affirmative action that the
authors seek to demolish is the assertion that since blacks
admitted through race-sensitive policies do not keep up with their
white colleagues, they end up failed and stigmatized, an argument
put forth by Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom in their influential
book ``America in Black and White'' (Simon and Schuster, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``When students are given a preference in admission because of
their race or some other extraneous characteristic,'' the
Thernstroms wrote, ``it means that they are jumping into a
competition for which their academic achievements do not qualify
them and many find it hard to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowen and Bok say their data contradict that assertion. They
found that the black dropout rate for the elite institutions
practicing affirmative action was 25 percent, much lower than the
national black dropout average of 60 percent. The more selective
the college, the lower the black dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, one of a handful of people given
advance copies of the book, said he was deeply impressed by the
quality of the study and by its conclusion that blacks given a
chance to attend elite colleges went on to lead successful lives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the stigma that opponents say affirmative action
imposes on blacks who attend these schools, Powell dismissed it,
saying, ``I would tell black youngsters to graduate from the
schools magna cum laude and get one of those well-paying jobs to
pay for all the therapy they'll need to remove that stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the authors say, their findings offer robust support
for the way in which selective colleges have engaged in admissions
procedures, examining merit in a broad context and assessing both
the needs of the institution and the society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask what bothers the public about these admission
policies, it is probably the sense that there is some unfairness
here,'' Bok said. ``I have two responses. One is that there is a
tendency to equate fairness with high school grades and scores that
is not well-founded in terms of admissions practices. Second,
fairness is something that really has to be defined in terms of
what the institution is legitimately trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of universities and colleges, race turns out to be
very relevant because we are interested in what students can teach
one another and race is a part of that in an increasingly diverse
society. Well-prepared minorities have a special leadership role
because there have been so few in the past. So what is fair
involves the question of the purpose of a university. And,
ultimately that question is not soluble with data.''

POLLOCK AND MONET: DISTANT KINSHIP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was dubbed the ``young man from Wyoming'' in the publicity
for his first show 55 years ago. Never mind that he actually spent
less than a year in Cody, a turn-of-the-century tract development
cooked up by William (Buffalo Bill) Cody, or that he went to high
school in Los Angeles until he dropped out to move to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The notion stuck of Jackson Pollock as a kind of cowboy, and
therefore a quintessentially American artist, the paradox being
that much of the American public vilified him, his work epitomizing
to them the sort of nonsensical art that Europe was always foisting
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   How specifically ``American'' were Pollock's pictures? It's
fitting that two of the big shows this fall are the Pollock
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in November and the late
Monet show at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston this month.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time critics regarded Monet's last years, at Giverny,
as irrelevant and anachronistic against the backdrop of movements
like Cubism and Constructivism. Most of the works stayed in Monet's
studio at his death, unsigned. He didn't even try to sell or
exhibit them, nor did his heir, his son Michel, who let them remain
in the studio for nearly 30 years, hoping opinion might shift in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
   It finally did. Artists like Andre Masson wrote admiringly of
the pictures in the early '50s. Big collectors like Walter Chrysler
Jr. and institutions like the Modern bought some of them,
justifying their value specifically in terms of what was going on
in art then: Monet's late works were called near-abstract
precursors of Abstract Expressionists' paintings. Pollock became a
kind of retroactive stamp of approval for Monet.
</P>
<P>
   As the critic Tom Hess put it at the time: ``In the past decade
paintings by such artists as Pollock, Rothko, Still, Reinhardt,
Tobey, and writings by such artists as Andre Masson and Barnett
Newman, have made us see in Monet's huge late pictures, and in the
smaller, wilder sketches he made for them, a purity of image and
concept of pictorial space that we now can recognize as greatly
daring poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Pollock's supporters helped to establish his bona
fides by relating his art to late European modernism, which
included Monet. Popular books like John Canaday's ``Mainstreams of
Modern Art'' juxtaposed Monet with Pollock, giving credence to one
through the other. And Hess, writing about ``a web of hues'' and
``handwriting loops and swirls,'' used language associated with
Pollock to describe Monet.
</P>
<P>
   The coincidence of the two shows this season may therefore tell
us not just what sets Monet and Pollock apart, but, at least
implicitly, what connects them.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, popularity isn't a link. No matter what the
critics said, the public never needed any excuse to like Monet's
late Waterlilies. On the other hand, Pollock's paintings probably
continue to mystify and annoy people for whom even Duchamp's urinal
is, by now, a comprehensible, if not necessarily agreeable, act of
cultural insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent difficulty of Pollock's art perhaps partly
explains why this exhibition is the first full-dress retrospective
of his work in this country in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It will be especially interesting to see how art experts react
to it. Pollock as much as any artist has been through the ringer of
critical opinion since he died in a car wreck 43 years ago. He has
been a lightning rod for Pop painters, feminists and just about
everyone else who has wanted to rewrite the story of postwar
American art, proof among other things of his unshakable
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Will this engender a certain feeling that he is old news by now?
His abstractions, exemplars of the 1950s, may seem unrelated to
what artists are doing in the '90s _ until, that is, you realize
the impact they have had on everyone from Richard Serra to Sue
Williams to Jason Rhoades to Terry Winters; and the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be surprised if his work comes as a revelation to
many people.

 &HT;    CLINTON SUMMONS DEMOCRATS FOR WHITE HOUSE MEETING
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton summoned House Democratic leaders
for an urgent White House meeting Wednesday morning amid signs that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was nearing completion of a
massive report to Congress on possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh polls suggesting that Clinton's troubles could badly
hurt Democrats in November elections, the president decided to
postpone his departure for a brief trip to Florida on Wednesday so
he could meet over coffee in the White House residence with some of
his party's most prominent members.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a lot to talk about,'' said White House spokesman
Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the session would cover legislative matters as well as
the Clinton's relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the White House was trying to schedule a second
meeting Thursday involving Democratic and Republican leaders from
both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., were scheduled to meet Wednesday to
discuss possible procedures for impeachment proceedings against
Clinton. That meeting also is to include Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and the panel's ranking
Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Committee staff members from both parties met Tuesday afternoon
in an attempt to resolve disputes over how to handle Starr's report
and conduct hearings on its findings. Those details are expected to
be put in the form of a resolution, which will be taken up by the
Rules Committee as soon as Starr notifies Gingrich that the report
is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's political activity was unfolding as anticipation grew
of a report from Starr's office, which has been investigating for
eight months charges that Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky and
later urged her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   After denying the affair in January, Clinton admitted to it in a
televised address Aug. 17, but he has continued to insist that he
did not counsel her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters he
expected Starr to deliver his report to Congress ``this week or
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, asked Starr in a
letter Monday that Clinton be allowed to have a week to review the
report and prepare a rebuttal before it is sent to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starr rejected the request Tuesday, saying in a letter that ``no
barrier should intervene between the House of Representatives and
its prompt receipt of impeachment-related information.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political position appeared to slip further Tuesday as
veteran Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., joined Democrats who have
publicly denounced the president's behavior in the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're fed up,'' said Hollings, who is in a tough battle for
re-election. ``The behavior, the dishonesty of the president is
unacceptable, and we'll see with the report what course the
Congress will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a moderate Republican group called Women in the Senate and
House urged Clinton to resign, saying he has ''tarnished the
presidency, crippled his effectiveness and shattered the trust of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That came two days after Paige Patterson, president of the
Southern Baptist Convention, Clinton's own denomination, called
Sunday for Clinton to resign ''for the good of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Tuesday, ''There are a variety of leaders in the
religious community, and some have taken a contrary point of view.
But they need to speak for themselves, out of their own conscience
and their own spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's efforts to direct attention to national
priorities yielded more embarrassment for him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, snubbed the
president by refusing to attend an event at an elementary school in
nearby Silver Spring, Md., in which Clinton called for increased
federal resources for badly needed repairs to the nation's crowded
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening had announced Saturday that he wouldn't show up out
of concern that Clinton's troubles over Lewinsky could hurt
Glendening's own re-election chances this November.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Glendening's views represented those of one
governor and not a national trend, adding that Clinton ''probably
understands why the governor feels the way he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening's fears could be well-founded, suggest the findings
of a bipartisan poll released Tuesday that showed Clinton's
popularity declining and voters deeply disturbed by the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and
Republican pollster Ed Goeas, showed Clinton's job approval rating
at 56 percent, compared to ratings of 62 percent or higher in
similar polls late last month. The new poll found Clinton's
personal approval rating, a measure of how people regard him as a
person, at 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters said there were indications ``that Democratic
voters, demoralized by President Clinton's problems and seeing
little incentive to vote for politicians and a system teetering on
the brink of moral bankruptcy, may choose to stay home'' on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas was more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has lost the trust of a large segment of the
American people,'' Goeas wrote, ''and he suffers from a diminished
moral authority to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake and Goeas jointly surveyed 1,001 registered voters around
the country between Aug. 24 through Aug. 26. The poll has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

 &HT;    SENATE CAMPAIGN DEBATE REOPENS WEDNESDAY
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's two-day countdown toward the year's
climactic vote on campaign finance reform will start Wednesday
morning, supporters of tighter restrictions said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under an arrangement with Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., agreed to
offer their bipartisan bill late Tuesday as an amendment to the
Interior Department appropriations bill. Revived after a similar
bill was passed by the House in early August, their bipartisan bill
would ban big, unregulated gifts to political parties and tighten
rules for pre-election ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be having two full days of debate'' on Wednesday and
Thursday, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The key vote will be Thursday night. At that time, Republicans
expect to show that they have the votes to conduct a bill-killing
filibuster. Under Senate rules, McCain and Feingold will need votes
from 60 of the 100 senators in order to stop the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has ``no new head counts,'' he is ``cautiously
optimistic that the uphill battle'' for the measure will be
successful, said his press secretary, Nancy Ives.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar test last winter, supporters were eight votes
short. Seven Republicans and all 45 Democrats sided with McCain and
Feingold, while 48 Republicans voted against.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 48 holdouts has announced a change of position,
although eight have been targeted in newspaper ads placed in their
home states by Public Campaign. Ellen Miller, executive director of
the pro-reform advocacy group, said, ``It's about time that the
senators follow the will of the people they were elected to
represent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote to table it,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., one of
eight GOP targets, said Tuesday. ``I think it's an ineffective bill
and probably has First Amendment problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ads are aimed at swaying Lott, Lauch Faircloth of North
Carolina, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of
Colorado, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Mike DeWine of Ohio and
Christopher ``Kit'' Bond of Missouri.

EXCERPTS FROM STUDY ON ACADEMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with AFFIRM-IMPACT) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the study ``The Shape of the River:
Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and
University Admissions,'' written by William Bowen and Derek Bok,
which is to be released Wednesday by Princeton University Press:
</P>
<P>
   One reason why we care so much about who gets admitted ``on the
merits'' is because, as this study confirms, admission to the kinds
of selective schools included in the College and Beyond universe
pays off handsomely for individuals of all races, from all
backgrounds. But it is not individuals alone who gain. Substantial
additional benefits accrue to society at large through the
leadership and civic participation of the graduates and through the
broad contributions that the schools themselves make to the goals
of a democratic society. These societal benefits are a major
justification for the favored tax treatment that colleges and
universities enjoy and for the subsidies provided by public and
private donors. ...
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, to say that considerations of merit
should drive the admissions process is to pose questions, not
answer them. There are no magical ways of automatically identifying
those who merit admission on the basis of intrinsic qualities that
distinguish them from all others. Test scores and grades are useful
measures of the ability to do good work, but they are no more than
that. They are far from infallible indicators of other qualities
some might regard as intrinsic, such as a deep love of learning or
a capacity for high academic achievement. ...
</P>
<P>
   (S)electing a class has much broader purposes than simply
rewarding students who are thought to have worked especially hard.
The job of the admissions staff is not, in any case, to decide who
has earned a ``right'' to a place in the class, since we do not
think that admission to a selective university is a right possessed
by anyone. ...
</P>
<P>
   Race almost always affects an individual's life experiences and
perspectives, and thus the person's capacity to contribute to the
kinds of learning through diversity that occurs on campuses. This
form of learning will be even more important going forward than it
has been in the past. ...
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been little hard evidence to confirm the
belief of educators in the value of diversity. Our survey data
throw new light on the extent of interaction occurring on campuses
today and of how positively the great majority of students regard
opportunities to learn from those with different points of view,
backgrounds and experiences. Admissions ``on the merits'' would be
short-sighted if admissions officers were precluded from crediting
this potential contribution to the education of all students.
</P>
<P>
   Imposition of a race-neutral standard would produce very
troubling results from this perspective: such a policy would reduce
dramatically the proportion of black students on campus _ probably
shrinking their numbers to less than 2 percent of all matriculants
at the most selective colleges and professional schools.

APARTHEID ASSASSINS CONFESS KILLINGS IN OTHER LANDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Some of the apartheid era's worst
assassins began confessing to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission on Tuesday about murders and bombings they committed
outside South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although the assassins, all former policemen, hope to get
amnesty against prosecution in South Africa for planning an
explosion that went off in the heart of London and for mailing
letter bombs that killed women and children in Angola and
Mozambique, they are, by confessing, opening themselves up to
charges and possible extradition requests from the countries where
the crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
   An observer from Scotland Yard was in the audience Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are scheduled to take three weeks. The only person
to testify Tuesday before microphone problems cut the hearings
short was Johan Coetzee, commander of the national police Security
Branch from 1980 to 1983 and commissioner from 1983 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In his application for amnesty from the commission, which
investigates apartheid-era crimes, Coetzee outlined the plot behind
the bombing of the London headquarters of the outlawed African
National Congress on March 14, 1982. He described how bomb parts
were sent to London in a diplomatic pouch _ other reports have said
they were inside a cookie tin in the pouch _ and assembled inside
the South African Embassy. The bomb killed no one but damaged the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was intended, Coetzee testified, both to scare the
ANC and to ``demonstrate our government's disenchantment'' that the
British government was letting the ANC and its ally, the South
African Communist Party, maintain public London offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Pretoria government was also incensed because it had
evidence that a 1981 rocket attack by five black guerrillas on
Voortrekkerhoogte _ South Africa's equivalent of the Pentagon _ had
been aided by two white British sympathizers who rented the house
in Pretoria where the guerrillas hid, and concealed their rockets
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The London bombing was ordered, repeatedly and adamantly, by the
late Louis le Grange, then minister of police, Coetzee testified.
He said he had not been told if anyone above le Grange _ including
President P.W. Botha _ gave the order. However, he was assured that
Pretoria was ``prepared to face severe diplomatic consequences''
with the British if the bombers were caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe,'' he added, ``that le Grange would have
decided on such an operation on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, the hearings are expected to go into other
crimes, including letter bombs that killed Ruth First, wife of Joe
Slovo, then head of the South African Communist Party, in
Mozambique, and Jeanette Schoon, wife of Marius Schoon, an ANC
activist, and their 7-year-old daughter, Katryn, in Angola. Mrs.
First's three grown daughters were in the hearing room Tuesday, as
were Schoon and his 15-year-old son, Fritz, who was 2 years old and
in the room with his mother and sister when they were killed. Both
families oppose amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Schoon, speaking in a hallway after the hearing, said he once
pressed Angola to arrest Williamson, who frequently travels there
to run a vegetable-import business. ``They didn't do anything,'' he
said, somewhat bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Schoon said that this is the second time since his wife and
daughter were killed that he has been in the same room with the man
who confessed to their murder. Asked his feelings about the
commission, he said: ``I think it's going to bring national
reconciliation. In my case, it's not going to bring about personal
reconciliation. But on the whole, I'm in favor _ the really big
maggots are beginning to come out from beneath the stones.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coetzee mentioned other ``extraterritorial operations'' he was
involved in planning: commando raids on ANC sites in Maseru,
Lesotho, and Gabarone, Botswana, and a bombing raid on Maputo,
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Other people expected to testify include Craig Williamson, the
ex-policeman sometimes referred to as ``Super-spy'' in the South
African newspapers, who has already confessed to mailing the letter
bombs and overseeing the London bombers, and Eugene de Kock, known
as ``Prime Evil'' for his command of an assassination squad. He is
serving two life sentences and more than 200 years in prison for
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these men are ever prosecuted by the countries where the
bombs exploded ``depends on whether they ever choose to leave the
country,'' said John Allen, chief spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, any ex-policeman who confesses to taking part in
the London bombing could be arrested if he appeared at an airport
of a European Union country. The Mozambican and Angolan justice
systems barely function, but Botswana is capable of effecting
arrests, and army generals who planned the Gabarone raid have
resisted confessing it to the commission because they still enjoy
hunting trips into Botswana, Allen said. He added that there were
no agreements he knew of with any country to ignore the crimes if
the amnesty applicants here confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson's lawyer, Allan Levin, said he had asked Justice
Minister Dullah Omar for assurances that, if Williamson is granted
South African amnesty, he would fight any extradition request by
Britain or any other country. ``The minister has refused,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Counseling his client to testify was therefore a calculated
risk, Levin said. Williamson, who is well-known and easily
recognizable because he is obese and bearded, poses readily for
photographs and repeatedly talks about his crimes to journalists,
faced almost certain criminal prosecution in South Africa and a
$500,000 civil suit by Schoon. Amnesty will remove those threats
even if it opens him up to the possibility of pursuit by Britain.

GANG MAKING INROADS IN NEW ENGLAND, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as LA-GANG)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An infamous national gang, whose earliest roots were nurtured by
Latino felons in the prisons of Chicago in the 1940s, is slowly
expanding deep into New England, according to authorities who
pursued alleged local gangsters for four months.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled arraignment Wednesday of Michael Angel Baez, 18,
arrested in Lowell, Mass. last weekend on a series of heroin
charges, is the latest troubling milepost of the Latin Kings'
incursion into the metropolitan Boston area, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing in numbers,'' said Detective Lieutenant Thomas
J. Quigley, commander of the Massachusetts State Police gang unit.
``I wouldn't say it's growing in large proportions, but there has
been an increase in the number of identified gang members.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez, known as ``King Mikey,'' was accompanied by other alleged
members of his gang in Lowell Friday night when he was arrested on
a 16-count drug indictment issued by a grand jury earlier that day.
State and local police allege Baez has sold heroin to undercover
state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, about seven spectators, who appeared to be supporters
of Baez, appeared in Lowell District Court on the mistaken belief
he was to be arraigned there. Dressed mostly in black, they left
quickly after Baez did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant James Trudel, of the Lowell Police special
investigation section, said the four-month probe _ which included
undercover and electronic surveillance _ was touched off by a
springtime murder that officials worried would trigger even more
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Khedy Leang, 13, was shot to death April 16 _ the youngest ever
to die in Lowell as a result of gang activity. &UR;  &LR; Police said another
youth and three friends planned the murder to avenge a knife attack
on his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Latin Kings are not suspects in that murder, they
were identified as part of the police crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided it was time to start targeting the gang,'' said
Trudel. ``They have a very rigid tier of authority that's
structured so if one person is arrested, the next person in line
immediately steps in. They have chapter meetings and a strict set
of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudel said more arrests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We're trying to stop them before they get a foothold in the
city,'' he said. ``We've shown we can go after their top player,
and we're going to work our way down until we can get as many as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lowell officials said Baez was the leader of just 12
``hard-core'' followers, Quigley estimated there are as many as
2,000 members of the Latin Kings in Massachusetts. There are
chapters operating in Boston, Worcester, Springfield, Brockton,
Lynn, Lawrence, Lowell, Fitchburg and Leominster, he said. The
Latin Kings also have groups now operating from Illinois and
Florida and from Connecticut to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's most conspicuous chapter, in New York City, won
national attention last year when its leader, Antonio Fernandez,
known as ``King Tone,'' said he was seeking to transform the gang
from street-corner violence to storefront activism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Locally, members of the Kings have promised to use five
points of their so-called ``crown'' _ love, respect, sacrifice,
honor and obedience _ for good.
</P>
<P>
   But if the members have heard the more temperate edicts from the
group's national leader in New York, local authorities say they've
seen little evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of what they're proclaiming, but we just haven't
seen it here,'' said Quigley. ``We're dealing with crimes that they
commit. And a lot of the crimes they commit are against their own
people, be it assault and battery or extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Students of street gangs said the temperate rhetoric is little
more than a facade for far-reaching criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have employed a very sly method of deceiving the
public,'' said Edwin Delattre, dean of the Boston University School
of Education who had studied and written about gangs. ``Their real
business is criminality and criminal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They present this front that says they're interested in civic
and ethnic pride and the self-esteem of the young. They have
mastered this jargon and the lingo of being on the side of the
young,'' Delattre said. ``But they have deceived parents, and
children and business people alike. These people are not
benevolent. They're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Delattre said the Latin Kings, already estimated at 30,000
strong nationwide, are pushing for a national membership of 100,000
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, David C. Brotherton, a gang specialist at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice who is writing a book about the Latin
Kings, said there is evidence that the Latin Kings are seeking to
remake themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing it in terms of their drop in the involvement in
crime and the recidivism has dropped,'' said Brotherton, who has
interviewed more than 100 gang members.
</P>
<P>
   But police are skeptical, and intend to keep pressure on the
Latin Kings' fledgling efforts in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the interaction that I've had with the Latin Kings shows
that they're gang members with one thing in mind,'' said Trudel,
``and that purpose is to spread their gang through criminal
activity. I consider them a dangerous organization. We want to have
them looking over their shoulder.''

BOSTON MINISTER TAKES OATH AS AMBASSADOR TO TANZANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Massachusetts neighborhoods converged in a
gold-toned reception room overlooking the capital Tuesday as the
Rev. Charles R. Stith was sworn in as US ambassador to Tanzania
with pledges to increase trade and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was tinged by somber reminders that Monday marked
one month since the twin bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya. At the opening of his speech, Stith read the names of the 10
embassy employees, all Tanzanians, who were killed in the Dar es
Salaam bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone needed reminders. Outside, in a semi-circular
driveway that has long welcomed visitors to the State Department,
workers Tuesday finished installing 26 metal posts to keep out
cars. To add another layer of protection, the driveway was also
blocked by three government-owned Dodge Ram trucks, so new that the
price stickers were still on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the State Department, on once-bustling
Virginia Avenue, police waved away cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's determination to go to his post and supervise the
reconstruction of the embassy is a sign ``the United States will
not let terrorism scare us away from protecting out interests
overseas,'' said Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bombings, which killed 263 people and wounded
more than 5,000, Stith said, ``We were devastated by the loss, but
let the message go forth. ... We will never be intimidated by
terrorist thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him stood Edith Bartley, 25, an American whose father and
brother were killed in the Kenya explosion, and to his side was
John Lang, the top-ranking State Department official, who
coordinated the rescue effort in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombings, career diplomats considered Tanzania a
quiet, out-of-the way posting. The country of 29 million is a
democracy with free elections and a government that echoes
Washington's talk of free trade. Stith, though, will have the added
duties of overseeing reconstruction of the embassy and repairs on
the ambassador's residence while consulting with the FBI and other
agencies on the bombing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a rousing speech to nearly 400 friends _ mostly from Boston's
religious, academic and business communities _ Stith spoke about
the path from the segregated St. Louis neighborhood where he grew
up to his new assignment in East Africa as a US diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have risen from the cusp of poverty to become a
representative of this country and an adviser to its president is
an honor, and it is humbling,'' Stith said to applause in the
ornate Benjamin Franlin room atop the State Department. The
late-afternoon swearing-in ceremony had the air of a testimonial
dinner. The audience included retired Superior Court Judge Harry J.
Elam, former Boston schools superintendent Robert ``Bud'' Spillane,
Oak Bluff's Police Chief Joseph Carter, and Harvard University
professor Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bombings, the job in Tanzania ``is no longer a
pretty inconspicuous post,'' said Roxbury District Court Judge
Edward R. Redd. ``It's going to require extra vigilance and extra
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith will be joined in Tanzania by his wife, Deborah
Prothrow-Stith, an associate dean at Harvard's School of Public
Health; their son Percy; their daughter Mildred, known as ``Mimi,''
and his mother-in-law, Mildred Prothrow, 80, who has plans to
volunteer at a school or hospital..
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing tapes to learn how to speak Swahili _ not that
I've learned anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Percy, 19, will take a year off from Bates College to work for
his father at the embassy. ``After the bombing, I had some friends
in college ask me, `Do still want to go there?' '' he said. ``We
definitely do.''

IBM TO OFFER DISK DRIVE OF TINY SIZE, BIG CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Business Machines Corp. plans to announce
Wednesday that it has developed an ultra-small, one-inch disk drive
aimed at the explosively growing market for hand-held computers and
consumer appliances like digital cameras and digital cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The drive, which will not be available commercially until
mid-1999, is particularly striking because it is intended to fit
into the same flash memory chip slots that are now standard in
digital cameras and other consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive will store about 5 billion bits of information a
square inch, weigh about half as much as a golf ball and store as
much as 340 megabytes of information, or the equivalent of about
300 hefty novels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the IBM disk advance offered further evidence that
the disk drive industry was now moving at a technological rate of
change in excess of the Moore's Law constant, which has marked
progress in the chip industry for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a silicon
chip doubles every 18 months. In recent years, the disk drive
industry has matched this rate of progress, increasing storage
density at the rate of about 60 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The current advance is particularly striking because chip makers
have been boasting that their tiny chips will ultimately displace
rotating memory systems that were once as large as washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, however, has now succeeded in forming an alliance with
compact flash manufacturers to create a standard that will permit
users to choose either flash memory chips or the new one-inch disk
drive interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, which IBM calls the Microdrive, fits into a new
industry standard called a CompactFlash Type II slot that is
already in use by some digital camera makers like Canon Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Microdrive can also be used with a standard PC card adapter
if a device does not have the new slot. IBM said that Canon,
Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi and Minolta were evaluating the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the issue was whether the market for consumer
devices beyond high-end digital cameras would emerge quickly enough
to justify the new small disk. The new drives are unlikely to be
used in existing laptops or even the newest generation of so-called
subnotebook laptops, which are using another type of small disk
drive that measures 2.5 inches and is coming in increasingly
thinner versions.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which now controls 40 percent of that market, recently
began shipping a drive that is 9.5 millimeters thick, compared with
the current standard of 12.5 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an engineering marvel,'' said James Porter, president
of Disk/Trend Inc., a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif.
``However, they still have to create a new market. I think they
will probably take some time for these to develop.''

VALUE OF HOME RUN BALLS COULD EXCEED $1 MILLION EACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as MCGWIRE-SOSA; attn.: Ill.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The baseball that Mark McGwire hits for his 62d home
run will have a retail market value of around $9. But the minute
somebody catches it, the value will skyrocket to $1 million or
more.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the contention of Steve Ray, a memorabilia
dealer who came to Busch Stadium intending to make just such an
offer to whoever winds up with the historic souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee he will get a chance. The previous six
homer balls _ including the 61st, which tied Roger Maris's
single-season record _ were caught by fans who returned them to
McGwire. All professed a love for the game and agreed with McGwire
that the balls belonged either in his possession or in the Baseball
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ray doesn't necessarily disagree with that notion, the
bottom line is that the market value of the 62d home run ball is
unlimited. With that in mind, his company, North Shore Sports LLC
of Northbrook, Ill., has combined with two New York memorabilia
dealers for a $1 million offer. The dealers will also shell out $1
million for the last home run ball of the season by McGwire or
Sammy Sosa, depending on who holds the record at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   If Ray's company gets the ball, it will have the option of
marketing it or selling it to the highest bidder at auction. If the
company retains the ball, it would be loaned to the Hall of Fame,
much like a priceless painting for a museum exhibit. Each way, the
company would get some free publicity and a leg up on the
television shopping market, which reportedly has put in a bid of
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding frenzy is no surprise. The selling of rings,
jerseys, bats, and baseballs is big business, Ray said. The lid
came off when Wal-Mart purchased a Honus Wagner baseball card from
Wayne Gretzky for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was use it in a promotion,'' he said. ``They set
it up with packs of cards. If you bought one, you got an entry
blank. From what I heard, they gave away the $600,000 card in a
raffle, but they did $180 million in business from it. That's the
promotional value of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who stands 6 feet 6 inches, said he had a seat in the
left-field bleachers at Busch and planned to bring his glove
Tuesday night. He would love to catch the ball himself and cut out
the middle man. But he doubts that will happen. When the ball is
caught, he will try to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One million is a great number,'' said Ray. ``It's a lot of
money. Do we think the ball is worth more? We don't know yet. This
piece is known across the entire world, not just the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think the piece should be given back to Mark
McGwire. But we're not the first people to make an offer on this _
and I don't think we will be the last. We're in the business. This
is my industry. This is why we do what we do. That guy (Mike
Davidson, who caught No. 61 Monday) was offered $100,000 for the
ball and it didn't affect him. You think $1 million will affect
him? Yes, that much changes your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray acknowledged that the person catching the ball may have
staggering tax considerations _ though one of the burdens was
lifted Tuesday when the Internal Revenue Service, under
congressional pressure, ruled that gift tax laws will not apply to
the person who donates the ball to McGwire immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The sports memorabilia business is unique, said Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you're going to a mom-and-pop store and buy a
pack of cards,'' he said. ``It's a real business today. You can
display stuff and it brings you back to your childhood. It's not
like coins, which sit in a safety deposit box. This is fun.''

   GREENSPAN-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Although there were many
players on Tuesday's stock market stage, the hero of the piece was
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. In a now
well-known speech before students at the University of California
at Berkeley on Friday, Greenspan suggested that the Federal Reserve
Board may cut interest rates if the financial crisis that has
humbled Asia and Russia and now threatens Latin America worsens.
Investors have come to believe, though it is not always so, that
falling interest rates inevitably push stock prices higher. Many of
these believers stampeded into stocks Tuesday.

   GREENSPAN-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Although there were many
players on Tuesday's stock market stage, the hero of the piece was
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. In a now
well-known speech before students at the University of California
at Berkeley on Friday, Greenspan suggested that the Federal Reserve
Board may cut interest rates if the financial crisis that has
humbled Asia and Russia and now threatens Latin America worsens.
Investors have come to believe, though it is not always so, that
falling interest rates inevitably push stock prices higher. Many of
these believers stampeded into stocks Tuesday.

   HMOS-ELDERLY (New York) _ After aggressively recruiting the
elderly and the disabled into their Medicare plans, many of the
nation's HMOs are now heavily retreating. The United Healthcare
Corp., once a darling of Wall Street, recently took a $900-million
charge against earnings, in part to scale back its Medicare
operations in 35 counties. In the last year, Aetna, Pacificare

   IN THE JUDEAN DESERT, WEST BANK _ Here is the parcel of land
that has been mired in the most recent stalemate between the
Israelis and the Palestinians: undulating dunes laced with scrub,
starkly beautiful if desolate, and barren but for the lizards and
an occasional Bedouin encampment.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast of Hebron and barely more than an hour from Jerusalem,
this is the latest 3 percent of the West Bank that the Israelis
have been loath to surrender and the Palestinians hesitant to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to become a so-called nature reserve within the
13 percent of territory that Israel would turn over to the
Palestinians if the long-stalled second withdrawal were to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, is to
arrive in Jerusalem on Wednesday, his first trip since May, when
not only the size and location but the very notion of a final
parcel of land was a deal-breaking issue.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer the Israelis have quietly agreed to surrender 13
percent of the West Bank, provided that they retain security
control over the last parcel. The Palestinians have tentatively
agreed to accept, although they have balked at Israel's demand for
zoning control over the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Not even two weeks before the Jewish High Holy Days, when
Israeli diplomacy effectively shuts down for a month, Ross' trip
comes at a critical moment for all parties to the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are eager for a foreign policy success, or at
least eager to avert failure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
feeling new political pressure as serious talk of a secular
centrist party has arisen. And Yasser Arafat is eager to gain
formal ownership of more land before next May, when the interim
peace accord expires and he says he intends to declare a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   While some Palestinians and some Israelis alike believe that
neither leader truly wants an accord, advisers to both insist that
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi feels pretty close, pretty confident that the whole thing
could move forward now,'' said David Bar-Illan, a spokesman, using
Netanyahu's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, a close adviser to Arafat, said: ``He has
depression. I tell him, `You are like Job. In your place I would
destroy the whole peace process.' But he says, `Fortunately I am
not like you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been facing an increasingly outspoken Palestinian
National Council, with some members quite critical of his
allegiance to two ministers accused of corruption. And he must also
massage tense relations with Hamas, the militant Islamic movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his home in Gaza City, the spiritual leader
of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, described the peace talks as a ``kind
of entertainment for people, just a waste of time, like a pretty
balloon waiting to be punctured.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, every time Ross and his negotiating team check into the
Laromme Hotel in Jerusalem, both sides turn hopeful. A
knowledgeable but skeptical Israeli observer put at 55 percent
their chances of making concrete progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ross' last visit, the primary channel for negotiations has
been between a personal confidant of Netanyahu, Yitzhak Molcho, an
urbane and almost apolitical lawyer, and Ahmed Qurei, better known
as Abu Ala, the senior Palestinian negotiator, who is also
considered the most skillful.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Israeli and Palestinian politicians have
questioned the Clinton administration's clout. ``America is weak,
so Arafat must wonder whether they can deliver, and that affects
their role here,'' said Natan Sharansky, the minister of industry
and trade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ross' challenge is to work out a package that addresses, among
other things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Israel's demands for a Palestinian crackdown on illegal
weapons and for a large police force, possibly using the local CIA
station for inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Israel's demand that Arafat convene the Palestine Liberation
Organization leadership _ or some part of it _ to eliminate from
the Palestinian Covenant a call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palestinian Authority's demands for a timetable for
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, and for the setting up of a
committee that would address the third redeployment of Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   This land itself is still an issue within Israel. The land to be
handed over has not been publicly identified by the Israeli
government. It has been referred to only abstractly as the 3
percent, or the nature reserve. It would be declared a nature
reserve so that there could be no construction, but it is unlikely
to be a park.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army, which uses this area as a firing zone, and
Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister who is now minister of
infrastructures, say it is of critical strategic importance, since
it is close to the Dead Sea and Israel's eastern border.
</P>
<P>
   But the only other option would be to hand over a piece of land
much closer to the Jewish settlements near Mount Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Here there are few residents. With harsh sun and dryness during
the summer and severe flooding in the winter, it is inhospitable
terrain, even for animals. It is home to a species of lizard with a
thick, spiked tail and to the eagle. Several Bedouin families and
their goats live in the hills, but mostly above the parcel in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would change here under the Palestinian Authority,''
said Salaam Jahaleen, a Bedouin man. ``There is no electricity, no
water, and there will be no electricity, no water. No TV, no
teachers. It's land that nobody wants to invest in.''

MARAKET LIKES GREENSPAN COMMENT; DOW JONES SOARS 380 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market, which has carried investors on a
wild downward ride during the last two weeks, shot through the
ceiling Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
hinted that the nation's central bank might cut interest rates to
offset an economic slowdown. The Dow Jones industrial average
jumped 380 points, its largest one-day point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Following investors around the world, who had an extra day to
digest Greenspan's Friday remarks because of the Labor Day holiday
here, US stock buyers sent share prices flying at the opening bell
and barely looked back. The 30-stock Dow gained almost five percent
to close at 8020.78. The computer-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index
jumped 94.32 points, or more than six percent, to close at 1660.84,
its second largest point gain.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate cut would help American companies by prolonging
the nation's economic boom, which started in April 1991 and is
approaching a peacetime record. But analysts conceded that a rate
cut alone would not solve the mounting problems in Russia, Asia and
elsewhere that have frightened investors in recent weeks. They
traced the upward bound in stock prices both here and abroad to
relief among investors that someone is finally turning attention to
the world situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan speech didn't change any of the fundamental problems
in the world economy'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in New York, ``But it counts when
somebody as powerful as he is steps in and says the Fed will act if
a major crevice opens in the world financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rally saw the Dow stocks gain back most of what they
lost in last week's five-percent market plunge, but that still left
the bellweather average _ and the market as a whole _ well below
their highs for the year. Before the rally, the Dow had lost almost
1,700 points, or 18 percent of its value, from its mid-July peak.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week, a worsening economic crisis in Asia that has
spread to Russia and Latin America had many investors convinced
that free markets were in retreat worldwide and that it was only a
matter of time before the long US boom ended. The result was a
broad selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In his Friday speech in Berkeley, Calif., Greenspan alluded to
those fears, warning that the United States ``can't remain an oasis
(in) a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress,'' and
hinting that the Fed is no longer as worried about boom-spurred
inflation as it is of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed chairman never said that an interest rate cut
is imminent, he took the unusual step of disclosing that the
central bank's governing board changed its internal policy last
month from one of tilting toward a rate hike to one that makes a
rate cut as likely as not. That was all global investors wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the market as violently oversold as it was by Friday,
investors were looking for a reason to buy,'' said Richard B. Hoey,
chief economist with The Dreyfus Corp., which manages more than
$100 billion. ``If it hadn't been Alan Grenspan, it would have been
something else,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's buying binge was especially good news for stocks
battered in the recent market plunge, particularly those of
financial institutions and computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big financial gainers were American Express, up 6 3/8
to 80; J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co, up 3 9/16 to 90 1/2, and Citicorp, up 6
3/16 to 98 11/16. BankBoston shares, which lost more than 40
percent of their value since peaking in July, rose 1 13/16 to 37.
Leading the computer comeback was Dell Computer, whose shares had
fallen nearly one third despite recently reporting record profits.
Dell was up 5 3/16 to 59 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The big question now is whether the rally will continue or
falter, and some analysts said they saw signs of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, most of the gains were among the so-called big
capitalization stocks rather than smaller firms, a sign, according
to some, that investors are still edgy about the market's prospects
and eager to avoid risky bets. While both the Dow and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which include most big companies' shares, rose
five percent, the Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks gained a
somewhat more modest 4.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the runup comes just as analysts are about to begin
issuing their latest quarterly profit predictions, and all signs
point to a string of disappointments. For example, while analysts
began the three-month quarter in July predicting that profits of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies would jumped 10 percent, they
now believe profits will rise a mere 1.6 percent, and further
reductions are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Nothing much has changed since Friday,'' said Richard O.
Lodewick, reseach director with Boston Partners Asset Management,
which manages $17 billion. ``The prospect for growth of US comanies
have not changed signifcantly because of what Alan Greenspan
said.''

MOTHER CHARGED IN STRANGULATION DEATHS OF HER 6 CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL _ A wisp of a woman, not quite five feet tall and
wearing a hospital gown to court, was charged Tuesday with six
counts of second-degree murder for the strangulation deaths of her
children.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an organization that provides services for battered
Asian women began planning a defense fund for Khoua Her, based on
their belief that her actions were the byproduct of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as the response of a woman who was abused and
exposed to violence,'' said Pacyinz Lyfoung, executive director of
Asian Women United of Minnesota. ``We are not condoning what was
done, but we are supporting Khoua Her in this difficult time in her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her was a sad-eyed, silent presence at her brief arraignment, at
which a judge ordered her held on $1 million bail pending a
psychiatric evaluation. No pleas were entered on her behalf, but
her court-appointed public defender said he would enter innocent
pleas at the earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old woman, married at 13 and a mother six times
before age 20, stood with a frown fixed on her face. She showed no
other emotion as a translator relayed the proceedings to her. She
smoothed her hair once, glanced briefly at spectators in the small
courtroom, and at one point rested her cheek on her hand.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed dazed at times, and moved gingerly in and out of the
courtroom. Her lawyer, Bruce C. Wenger, said afterward she had hurt
her back last Thursday night, apparently in a suicide attempt on
the night of the children's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Wenger did not elaborate on Her's injuries, but a complaint
released Tuesday by St. Paul police added new details to the grim
discovery five days earlier at the McDonough Homes public housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramedics arrived at the family's townhouse around 7
p.m., having been summoned by a ``suicide in progress'' call that
Her made to 911. Forcing open a locked screen door and pushing open
an unlocked inner door, the officers found a semiconscious Her on
the floor, a brown extension cord draped loosely around her neck
and a red mark on her skin beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Her, in the living room, police found a small girl, lying
face down with a piece of black material tied tightly around her
neck. The girl was still warm, the officers said, but attempts to
revive her failed.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the stairway in the two-story home, a second
officer found an older boy, a strip of black material near his head
and an abrasion on his neck. A second boy was found in an upstairs
bedroom, also with a strip of material near his head.
</P>
<P>
   A third boy and a girl were found dead in the basement, and
shortly after, the sixth child, the youngest girl, was found dead
in the first-floor bathroom. The children were identified as boys
Kouaeai, 11, Samson, two weeks shy of his 10th birthday, and Tang
Lung, 7; and girls Nali, 9, Aee, 6, and Tung Ke, 5.
</P>
<P>
   While on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, Her allegedly spoke
at first only about suicide, but later stated, ``Well, I killed the
kids.'' She also allegedly told the dispatcher she tried to kill
herself about an hour before calling 911 and was having trouble
breathing. Police have not released the 911 tape.
</P>
<P>
   She offered no motive, the complaint says, saying, ``I don't
know why I killed my kids.'' Police found only Her and the children
in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Her's supporters pointed to what by all indications was a
combative relationship between Her and her estranged husband, Kong
``Tou'' Hang, who identified the children and told police he had
last spoken with his wife about a month ago. The two had been
brought together by Hang's mother in a Thai refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been called to their home 17 times since February
1996, with husband and wife trading accusations of abuse. Hang told
police Her had threatened him with a shotgun in June 1997, but it
was Her who received a protective order against Hang.
</P>
<P>
   Police earlier had said they wanted to question Her's boyfriend,
with whom she had been living, but Tuesday homicide investigators
said he had been ruled out as a suspect.

ON BROADWAY, HIGH HOPES FOR THREE CHAMELEONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadway seems to have chosen to dress like a wary,
much-married bride this season. There's plenty of something old and
something borrowed (from vintage movies and, of course, England)
and very little of something new.
</P>
<P>
   (For something blue, there's always the salty-mouthed Sandra
Bernhard, who is returning with her one-woman show ``I'm Still Here
... Damn It!'')
</P>
<P>
   Theater traditionally confounds handicappers, and at moments
like this it's a consolation to think that there are no guarantees
of what will run wire-to-wire. Did you really predict that a rock
operetta about AIDS and heroin addiction would break out of a small
downtown theater and go on to a robust life on Broadway and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   Still, I admit there are a few things I am looking forward to
with the sort of hopes that are usually dangerous. These are
centered on three actors who, though none have been on Broadway
recently, arrive with sterling pedigrees and in roles that would
seem to fit them like wet suits.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Short, the comedian of a thousand professional
alter-egos, will appropriately be playing not one but a number of
roles in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of the 1962
musical ``Little Me'' this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Dench, the great English actress who recently won American
hearts as a startlingly human Queen Victoria in the movie ``Mrs.
Brown,'' returns to New York this spring in David Hare's London hit
``Amy's View.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kevin Spacey, the Academy- and Tony Award-winning actor who
defies the casting director's notions of ``type,'' is also due this
spring as Eugene O'Neill's dream-smashing salesman in ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' a role he played to feverish acclaim in London.
</P>
<P>
   None of this trio gives off the megawatt glamour or Personality
with a capital P usually associated with stars. They are all, by
self-definition, chameleons, and anyone who knows their work has
marveled at the different colorings they seem to assume so
reflexively.
</P>
<P>
   They have technique to spare, for sure, but they are also
propelled by something far more potent: the fierce, fluid will to
become someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Short, who first claimed attention as a quick-sketch artist on
the Canadian comedy show ``SCTV'' and on ``Saturday Night Live,''
has always invested his oddball personae (remember the albino
show-biz baby Jackie Rogers Jr.?) with an energy and detail that
transcend cartoonishness.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has never quite figured out how to harness that force.
Nor, to date, has the stage, even though Short brought a winning
flair to the singing schlemiels of the ill-fated musical adaptation
of ``The Goodbye Girl'' and the Encores concert production of
``Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Little Me,'' which (like ``The Goodbye Girl'' and
``Promises, Promises'') has a book by Neil Simon, with songs by Cy
Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, this morph master may finally have the
opportunity he deserves. Short will be playing the doomed men in
the life of Belle Poitrine (an auspiciously cast Faith Prince), the
all-American femme fatale.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Caesar, a spiritual ancestor of Short's, created the parts.
Personally, I can't wait to see what Short does with the Maurice
Chevalier-like music hall performer who goes down with a
Titanic-like ship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dench (aka Dame Judi) is a short, round-faced woman who
soared to majesty on the London stage long before she took on
Victoria. Many critics believe her Cleopatra, for the Royal
National Theater opposite Anthony Hopkins, may be the best of the
century. (``She's 5-foot-nothing, yet she's got sex and wit, wit
and sex,'' said the director Peter Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Amy's View,'' she plays, most suitably, an eminent actress
for whom the stage is, quite simply, a religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dench, after all, has repeatedly said she prefers theater to
movies because a film performance is fixed; she can't keep growing.
``Layers, I play a lot of layers,'' says her character in ``Amy's
View,'' later observing that true artistry ``comes with the passage
of time: you go deeper _ right down to the core.'' Any time Ms.
Dench goes exploring for that core, you would be well-advised to
accompany her.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey also knows from layers. Think about how he piled them on
and then peeled them away as a furtive, compulsively chatty felon
in ``The Usual Suspects.'' Indeed, trying to find the actor beneath
the layers of characterization has become a cottage industry for
celebrity profilers.
</P>
<P>
   None has been successful. ``Nobody knows who I am yet,'' he once
said, ``and I want to keep it that way.'' But you never doubt that
you know his characters intimately, whether Spacey is playing a
nice Jewish gangster in ``Lost in Yonkers'' on Broadway or a
murderous Southern antiquary in the movie ``Midnight in the Garden
of Good and Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Iceman,'' he portrays a spiel spouter who is campaigning
against the illusions that people live by and who, in the play's
final act, divests himself of his own. This could turn out to be
the most provocative striptease of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Barney Frank Tuesday shrugged off a
crude remark made by a California congressman over the weekend as
part of the price of being a well-known, openly gay politician.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, a Republican,
apologized afterward for the remark, made at a San Diego
appearance, in which he mocked Frank and gay sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about Cunningham's comment, Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said, ``He seems to be more obsessed with homosexuality
than most homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said his high visibility made criticism and comments about
his sexuality and personal life inevitable. ``It comes with the
territory,'' he said. ``I get involved in controversy so I have to
expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Pope, a spokeswoman for Cunningham, said her boss would
have no further comment. ``He said he was out of line and
apologized and that is it,'' she said. She said she did not know
whether Cunningham intends to apologize to Frank. Frank said he had
not heard from him Tuesday.

RENO LAUNCHES NEW EVALUATION OF DEMOCRATIC FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as Reno-Gore)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno Tuesday began a
preliminary investigation into whether President Clinton or his
campaign was involved in an illegal effort to use Democratic Party
``soft money'' to pay for 1996 reelection campaign ads, Justice
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is slated to decide at the end of 90 days whether to seek
the appointment of an independent counsel, whose work would be
separate from the probe being conducted by Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As news of Reno's decision emerged in the late afternoon, White
House officials privately expressed exasperation that Starr's probe
could be followed by yet another investigation by another
independent counsel whose work could go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to conduct a preliminary review into Democratic
fund-raising comes nearly two years after reports first surfaced
about a string of alleged irregularities in the party's
fund-raising operation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a step she has long resisted, Reno announced her move in
a letter to the three-judge panel that could &UR;  &LR; decide whether to
appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have commenced a preliminary investigation,'' Reno wrote,
``involving President of the United States William Jefferson
Clinton concerning political advertisements during the 1996
election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican-authored Senate report issued last year concluded
that Clinton oversaw an elaborate enterprise in which millions of
dollars in unregulated soft money _ raised for the Democrats'
party-building efforts _ was used to pay for Clinton's reelection
ads. Such ads are supposed to be financed only with regulated
``hard money,'' which is more restricted and regulated than soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has previously launched 90-day reviews to examine whether
an independent counsel should be appointed to examine if Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore illegally solicited campaign funds in
telephone calls from the White House. Reno decided last year
against seeking a counsel to examine the phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 26, Reno said she had received new information about
Gore's calls that warranted another 90-day review. On Sept. 1, Reno
also ordered a 90-day preliminary review to determine if former
White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes violated campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in making her third decision in a month to start a
preliminary review of fund-raising matters, Reno again cited new
information as she decided to open the 90-day review into whether
the Clinton-Gore campaign illegally used Democratic Party soft
money. While Justice Department officials declined to describe the
new information, it apparently involved a Federal Election
Commission audit that turned up new questions about the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC audit reportedly recommended that the Clinton-Gore
reelection campaign repay $13.4 million in federal matching funds.
The Clinton-Gore campaign agreed to a $37 million spending limit in
the primaries in return for getting matching funds, and it would
have to repay an unspecified amount of money if it broke the limit
by using party soft money.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 campaign, both the Clinton and Bob Dole
campaigns benefited from millions of dollars worth of ``issue
advocacy'' ads broadcast by their respective parties. The ads were
supposed to help ``party-building'' efforts, but many of them left
the impression that they were election ads for Clinton or Dole. At
the time, officials of both parties said they were allowed to run
the ads as long as they didn't directly call for the election of a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Common Cause, the self-styled citizen's lobby that
has long sought an investigation of the ads, Tuesday said they were
pleased with Reno's announcement. But the organization's president
said Reno should have expanded the 90-day probe to include an
examination of similar ads by the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is long overdue,'' Common Cause president Ann McBride
said. ``However, we believe that what happened in the 1996 election
happened in the Clinton campaign and Dole campaign. It is very
important this be a bipartisan investigation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back to work. Back to school. Back to the roaring
bull market.
</P>
<P>
   So it went Tuesday as stocks kicked once again into high gear on
their biggest one-day point move ever. On a wave of emotional
buying that crescendoed in the last half hour of trading, the Dow
Jones industrial average rose 380.53 points on the day, a 4.98
percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were many players on Tuesday's stock market
stage, the hero of the piece was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan. In a now well-known speech before students at the
University of California in Berkeley on Friday, Greenspan suggested
that the Fed may cut interest rates if the financial crisis that
has humbled Asia and Russia and now threatens Latin America
worsens.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have come to believe, though it is not always so, that
falling interest rates inevitably push stock prices higher. Many of
these believers stampeded into stocks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But traders gave other reasons for the manic move in stocks, all
having more to do with psychology than with economics. In other
words, the world remains an economically precarious place, higher
stock prices notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, investors seemed to return from their Labor Day
weekend thinking that the unrelenting selling of the past two weeks
had taken stocks to levels that even Chicken Little would consider
overdone. It was time to hunt around for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may also have done a little check of the calendar and
found that it was time again to buy. Why? Because since 1981, all
bear markets have lasted an average of about 60 days. This includes
the whipping that investors took during the summer of 1983, the
crash of 1987, the bear market of 1990 and the decline of early
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor working in favor of stocks Tuesday was a flood of
buying by investors who had made bets that share prices were going
to continue their downward spiral, what Wall Street calls
short-covering. This is a type of forced buying caused when
pessimistic investors who had sold short-selling shares they did
not own in the hopes of buying them back later at lower prices see
these shares rise in value. Hurrying to cut their losses on trades
gone awry, these investors buy back the shares they had sold
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Goldman, Sachs market strategist Abby Joseph
Cohen appearing on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' on Sunday, giving her
cheery predictions for stock prices. Perhaps this audience, more
politically- than equity-inclined, had not yet heard her argument
for higher stock prices. Maybe they rushed to call their brokers
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's surge was impressive, traders said that its
steepness, particularly in the final half hour of trading, looked
very much like the work of so-called momentum investors, those who
buy stocks only after they have made a strong directional move.
Many of these investors execute their trades near the end of the
day in the hopes that the surge will draw in other investors the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday belonged to Greenspan. His comments telegraphing
the possibility of a rate cut were all investors needed to get
their grooves back.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Yes and no. Some of the stocks that made
the biggest moves Tuesday, favorites like America Online, Lucent
Technologies and Cisco Systems, do not qualify as interest-rate
sensitive stocks. It is to be expected that bank stocks would rally
on news of a possible rate cut, but why should lower interest rates
propel the shares of Internet darlings and computer makers?
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, shares of certain companies that would benefit from
lower rates barely budged Tuesday. Homebuilders Toll Brothers,
Lennar Corp. and Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp. only inched up on the
day.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, ironic that Greenspan's remarks ignited a new
round of stock market euphoria that he has scolded investors for
exercising in the past. And one money manager noted Tuesday's move
was another example of the market absorbing news almost
instantaneously, leaving no time for investors to mull it all over
and no room for error.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Tuesday's trading, a substantial interest rate cut _
one-half of one percentage point, not the one-quarter Greenspan is
famous for _ was almost instantly factored into stock prices. What
happens if the Fed doesn't ease monetary policy in its meeting
Sept. 29? The market would be mighty disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a possible rate cut gave fuel to Tuesday's fiery
stock prices, traders pointed out that it shouldn't have been news
to investors. Bond traders are already counting on not one, not
two, but three one-quarter percentage point cuts in rates.
Investors can see these expectations in the 5-year Treasury trading
at a yield of 4.92 percent Tuesday compared with the federal funds
rate of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough Tuesday, while stocks were racing, bonds yawned. The
30-year Treasury bond yielded 5.36 percent at the end of the day's
trading, up from the 5.28 percent close of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What stock market investors heard in Greenspan's Berkeley speech
was that they now had something they had been sorely lacking for
weeks: a backstop. A tower of strength. A grownup in charge. With
the world in disarray, the International Monetary Fund weakened and
President Clinton hobbled, equity investors seized on Greenspan as
the best candidate to save the planet.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that there is truth to this assessment.
Greenspan will do what he has to do to calm markets worldwide. But
there is also truth in this: the future health of the stock market
depends not so much on interest rates as it does on corporate
profits. And those are still looking dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Salomon Smith Barney's economics group lowered their
estimates for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 profits for both 1998 and 1999
last Friday. The analysts, led by Mitchell Held, wrote that they
were now expecting earnings growth on the S&AMP;P of just 1.5 percent
this year and, more ominously, a decline of 1 percent next year.
They believe that the downturn in Asia will continue well in 1999
and that growth in the emerging markets of Latin America will slow
from 3 percent in 1998 to zero next year. Take into account Canada,
a country that has seen its currency crater and one that accounts
for 25 percent of U.S. exports, and you have questions about the
health of nearly 75 percent of the market for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded: ``Financial market developments of recent
weeks will result in slower economic activity on a global scale in
the year ahead, dimming the earnings outlook for domestic companies
considerably.''

CITING NETSCAPE LETTER, MICROSOFT AGAIN SEEKS DISMISSAL OF
ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a document that Microsoft says undermines the
government's case against it, a Netscape attorney wrote to the
Justice Department in March and admitted that the Internet browsing
function cannot be removed from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft filed the letter with a 48-page brief Tuesday renewing
the company's call that the government's antitrust case should be
dismissed. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is scheduled
to hear arguments on that question Friday. If he does not dismiss
the case, the trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's brief continued the recent escalation in rhetoric
used by the warring sides in the highly publicized legal battle.
Microsoft accused the government of ``blatant misrepresentation,''
``a smear tactic,'' ``vague and constantly changing allegations,''
``a profound lack of confidence in the case they filed in May,''
and ``a baseless personal attack on the credibility of Microsoft's
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They attempt to distract the court from the fatal defects in
their claims by slinging as much mud as they can at the defendant
(Microsoft) and by giving prominence to numerous irrelevant facts
in a desperate attempt to cloud the issues,'' Microsoft said in its
brief. ``Plaintiffs (the federal and state governments) apparently
hope that a combination of overblown rhetoric and the sheer volume
of paper they have submitted in opposition to Microsoft's motion
will lead the court to throw up its hands in frustration, conclude
there must be disputed issues of fact and deny Microsoft's motion
(for dismissal) without seriously considering the sufficiency of
plaintiffs' claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department shrugged off the latest filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's reply is nothing new,'' said Justice Department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona. ``We look forward to proving at the
upcoming trial that Microsoft engaged in a series of
anti-competitive acts to maintain its operating system monopoly and
to extend that monopoly to Internet browsers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its case against Microsoft, the Justice Department and the
attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia accuse
the Redmond-based software giant of illegally seeking to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers. The illegally anti-competitive acts allegedly included
forcing consumers to use Microsoft's Internet browser by
integrating the browser into the ubiquitous Windows operating
system, and forcing computer manufacturers, Internet service
providers, Internet content providers and online service providers
to promote Microsoft's Internet browser through various licensing
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief yesterday, Microsoft said there is no evidence to
support any of those claims, and cited the letter from Netscape
Communications Corp. attorney Allen Snyder to Justice Department
antitrust chief Joel Klein.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Snyder said ``we are totally unable to provide
examples of files that can or can not be deleted from Windows 98
since ... it is our understanding that it simply is not possible to
delete any portion of IE (Internet Explorer), or of browser
functionality, from Windows 98 as presently configured without
severely interfering with the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the letter shows the browser is an integral part
of the operating system, and not an add-on inserted for
anti-competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also claimed that it has canceled all of the offending
licensing deals to answer any concerns about Netscape's ability to
distribute its own competitor browser to consumers. Microsoft said
it dropped controversial licensing deals with Internet service and
content providers ``because they were generating negative publicity
and because Microsoft determined that they were not commercially
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it is discontinuing the controversial
``channel bar,'' a feature that allowed consumers to move easily to
World Wide Web sites of Microsoft's paying partners, such as
Disney. The feature was unpopular among Microsoft critics, who
worried the company was starting to control what types of content
consumers would see on the Internet. More importantly, the feature
also proved unpopular with consumers, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it does not expect to include the ``Channel Bar''
in upgrades or future versions of Windows 98.

THE STARR REPORT AS CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - They say the report from Ken Starr may run a thousand
pages long, not counting the brown-paper wrapper and anatomy
charts. We are talking ``Gone With the Wind'' in length and in
scope, just as we'll be saying ``gone with the wind'' to the
presidency of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The report should be ready for Congressional eyes this week or
next. The salient questions number three, by my reckoning:
</P>
<P>
   - Was that ``Newsweek'' source _ the one who said ``When people
read (this) report, they'll want to throw up?'' _ right on the
money?
</P>
<P>
   - How long until the impeachment hearings start?
</P>
<P>
   - How much scratch are we talking if we option Starr's findings
to Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   This last question is key, because it represents the American
public's only chance to recoup the $40 million Starr has frittered
away. Plus _ let's be honest _ entertainment value may be the only
legacy left for President Number 42.
</P>
<P>
   Bill's always loved Hollywood; Hollywood's always loved Bill.
Adapting the Starr report might be a natural. Think silver screen,
big stars, Oscars:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Full Monica'' _ Fresh out of job offers from Revlon, a
group of unemployed former White House interns decides to take it
all off to, uh, make ends meet. Starring presidential
adviser/career counselor Vernon Jordan as himself and, in a cameo,
Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza as the &UR; political hack who demands the
interns stop dancing at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The flick would be rated R for nasty imagery, but it could've
been worse. We could've sold to the pornmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Line of Fire''? ``Air Force One''?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me while I go take a shower.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say we couldn't sell Starr's goods to television.
Again, there's limitless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Years'' _ Modeled after ``60 Minutes,'' this
investigative news hour stars Starr himself! Finished with Clinton,
the special prosecutor rids the country of some other overhyped
public figures: The pilot reveals that Ellen DeGeneres once kissed
men and that Mark McGwire doesn't wear a cup. He might be slow,
obsessed and pricy, but Ken Starr always gets his man.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this would work better as a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allewinsky McBeal'' _ The fact that the ``Big Creep'' won't
call sends our heroine running to a shrink. While on the couch, she
finally gets to the bottom of her irrational fear of dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, forget that Bob Saget. He's got nothing on our newest
reality TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos and Audios'' _ Linda Tripp
hosts this half-hour laughfest. Now you can actually hear the men
getting hit in the groin with errant golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should we leave out the cable networks. No way Lifetime, the
chick channel, could possibly resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary!'' _ You go girl! She gives investment advice _ stay
away from land in Arkansas! She gives fashion tips _ black works
best at resignation ceremonies! And she knows what life's like as
the other woman _ mortifying! She's the First Lady, and if half the
village tunes in, she's got herself a ratings winner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the President himself. Mr. Televised Town Hall
seems a natural as a talk-show host, where he could feel your pain
_ among other things. The trouble is, gabbing's a crowded field,
and Bill Clinton may be the only man in America with less
credibility than Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to typecast the guy, but I think he's stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spin City'' _ A politician in trouble tries to lie his way
clear, with absolutely no luck at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I have to admit it _ even to me, that sounds like
dullsville. Clinton's sitcom would probably be cancelled midway
through its run.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in America as we wait for the special prosecutor to
weave his thousand-page tale. Life mirrors art. &QL;

PEACE GETS LIP SERVICE AS TALKS ON CONGO END 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ Despite the official announcement
Monday night of a cease-fire agreement in the Congo, the latest
peace negotiations ended Tuesday much like the others in recent
weeks _ with nothing more than a joint statement endorsing peace as
an ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   The talks did succeed in bringing together all the parties
involved in the conflict, including the presidents of Congo,
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Uganda and Rwanda. But apparently
several issues left the participants deeply divided and at times,
officials acknowledged, there were heated exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the rebel forces also attended, but they were
kept separate from the heads of state and complained that they had
been badly treated and had been forced to spend four hours in a
stifling room without windows.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidents gathered for a news conference late Tuesday
morning, the rebels left for the airport, saying they did not feel
bound by anything the presidents had signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much support a cease-fire,'' said Bizima Karaha, one
of the leaders of the rebel group, the Congolese Democratic
Coalition. ``But because we have been excluded from it, we are not
bound by it.''.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents had little to show for their hours of discussion.
They issued a communique saying that ``the Congo needs peace'' and
that ``there must be a cessation of hostilities.'' They also said
their defense ministers would meet in two days in Ethiopia for
further talks.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out in Congo in July as rebel forces, backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, attacked the government of Laurent Kabila, who
had himself been in power less than 18 months. Kabila toppled the
former regime in the Congo, then known as Zaire, with the help of
Rwanda and Uganda but then had a falling-out with his former
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and
stirring ethnic hatred, particularly against Tutsi, the ethnic
group that dominates the leadership of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   At first the rebels appeared to be gaining ground quickly, and
even seemed poised to march into Kinshasa, the capital. But Kabila
was able to rally new allies _ Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia _ and
has managed to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Government forces appear to have pushed the rebels back to the
eastern part of the country. Fighting was reported to be continuing
even as the heads of state issued their statement.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the summit meeting, President Frederick Chiluba
of Zambia, admitted that much work had to be done before any
concrete peace proposals could be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The most heated exchanges were apparently between Kabila and
Rwanda's president, Pasteur Bizimungu. One sticking point has been
that Rwanda continues to assert that it has no troops in Congo, and
therefore it cannot withdraw them. Uganda has admitted to having 50
troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The way the rebels should be treated during talks was also in
dispute.

   LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - They say the report from Ken Starr
may run a thousand pages long, not counting the brown-paper wrapper
and anatomy charts. The question: How much scratch are we talking
if we option Starr's findings to Hollywood? Think of the film
possibilities: ``The Full Monica'' _ Fresh out of job offers from
Revlon, a group of unemployed former White House interns decides to

 &HT;    Stocks soar after Greenspan announcement
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did Chicken Little get it wrong again?
</P>
<P>
   You'd think so, judging by the stock market's stunning surge on
Tuesday, when three stock market averages posted their biggest
one-day point gains ever.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-loaded Nasdaq composite index jumped 6 percent,
reflecting the intense demand for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 5 percent and
the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks was up 4.3 percent, all on
strong volume.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street analysts were already saying late last week the
worst of the late summer sell-off might be over, though market
weakness could continue.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan buoyed
investor spirits with a speech Friday suggesting the Fed's next
move might be to cut short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term Treasury yields, which are set by the marketplace,
have already trended down to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan didn't promise a rate cut, but that was the spin that
the market put on his comment that inflation is no longer the Fed's
No. 1 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next policy meeting is Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments were followed by a three-day holiday
weekend of relative calm on world economic fronts, which primed
investors to be in a buying mood on Tuesday. Stocks surged and
stayed there all day, adding to their gains at the end of the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think this signals the end of the worst sell-off
on Wall Street since the 1990 bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not issuing an all-clear because we never told people to
duck and cover,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist for
Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He noted a cut in interest rates would be a stimulus to business
spending that would also help the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy drives the stock market. Any move that helps the
economy would definitely be good news for profits and for stocks,''
said Skrainka.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts are more cautious about what Tuesday's buying
means, pointing out that historically, markets often rally as much
as 50 percent from a big slump, only to dip again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 19.3 percent from its July 17 high of 9,337.97 to
its Aug. 31 low. Tuesday's close represented a 6.4 percent rebound
from that low. If the Dow recaptures 50 percent of its recent loss,
it would be back above 8,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of technical damage has been done to the market and it
would be a surprising situation for it to come roaring back,'' said
Interstate/Johnson Lane technical analyst Ricky Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more logical for the market to rebuild a base. I
wouldn't be surpsied to see market sell-off Wednesday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said the Dow is still trading at a price-to-earnings
ratio of about 20 despite the index's recent drop of almost 1,800
points, which means there is still a lot of ``froth'' in share
prices. The Dow's historic P/E is about 15.
</P>
<P>
   The next most frequent scenario from analysts is that stocks
will continue to trade within a 100-point range for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   By then, analysts say the full impact of another factor that is
getting increased attention on Wall Street _ President Clinton's
White House problems _ will likely have been resolved.

 &HT;    Opinions vary in town that bears president's name
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, N.C. _ Retired state trooper William Pate gets so angry
thinking about President Clinton these days that he wants his rural
Carolina hometown to change it's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want nothing to do with the man,'' said Pate. ``I
think it's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has never set foot in his Carolina namesake _ it
was named for a Revolutionary War hero 180 years ago _ but his sex
scandal and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation stir
up plenty of strong feelings among residents here, with many ready
to forgive and forget and others so upset they say they would run
him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 60 miles south of the state capital of Raleigh and
the hometown of Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), Clinton may not be
Middletown, USA, but residents here sum up the president's travails
in much the same way as the rest of the country outside of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For folks here, Clinton's statements about former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and his relationship with her aren't about
legal semantics _ whether or not what he said was misleading but
``legally accurate.'' It's about sex in high places, telling the
truth and the nation's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Mayor Emsley Kennedy, think Starr has ``wasted the
taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's private life ought to be his private life, whether
it's the president of the United States or the person on the
street,'' Kennedy said. ``By gosh, what's it been _ four or five or
six years now? It's just ridiculous, I think. If they've got some
charges bring them forward and get it over with. Decide what you
are going to do and get on with the country's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Others such Pate get so bothered talking about the president
they loose their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told when I was a youngin' to tell the truth,'' said
Pate. ``He stood up there and looked in a million peoples' faces
and said I did not do it. And then he come back and said I did do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This country would be a lot better with (him) out of there,''
Pate continued, working up a full head of steam. ``If he'll lie
once, he'll lie again. He's never told this country he's sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the town of Clinton was named for Lt. Col.
Richard Clinton, militiaman in the revolutionary war, whose land
now holds the Sampson County courthouse. Albert Kaleel, a member of
the Clinton City Council, said no one has asked to have the town's
name changed since the Clinton scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Kaleel, who's been serving hot dogs and hamburgers from
his lunch counter on the town square since 1932, said he thinks the
president ought to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake,'' said Kaleel between serving customers on
a recent afternoon. ``He'd been better off if he'd owned up to it
to start with, but after all he did own up to it eventually. How
many men wouldn't deny this if their wives were around?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kaleel, his own wife, Jane Kaleel, was around
to hear his final comment and issued a derisive snort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very careless and a liar,'' Mrs. Kaleel said of the
president. ``I would hate for him to be my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   James Colwell, clipping hair at Colwell's Barber Shop just down
the street, was more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a man,'' said Colwell. ``I can't expect no more of
him than I can expect of myself. I don't hold anything against him
_ I've got my own problems to keep straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Shaffer, with the local Farm Bureau, said he expects more
from politicians, especially presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to have leaders who have bad morals,''
said Shaffer, who belongs to the men's religious organization known
as Promise Keepers. ``If he's a government leader he ought to have
a little integrity. I don't think he has any. You are talking about
someone who's supposed to be an example to my family and my
children. I don't think he's setting a very good example.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether supportive or critical of the president, residents here
said the president's problems haven't occasioned nearly the amount
of discussion and debate as they have in Washington, where Congress
is paralyzed in anticipation of Starr's report and pundits can talk
of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Warren, owner of Just Nailz, said her customers don't talk
about the president that much, or if they do, it's ``comments like,
'They should leave him alone, let him run the country.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal problems are his own business,'' said Warren.
``If his wife can live with him then I can, too. He's not the only
one who has done that. He is probably the only one who has been
exposed. It's just a character trait in high places.''

 &HT;    North Korea: An analysis
 &HT;    By Han S. Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After some four years of waiting, Kim Jong Il, the son of
deceased leader Kim Il Sung, has finally been officially elected as
leader of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   That was not a big surprise:
</P>
<P>
   Kim has been the defacto leader of the country since his
father's death, even though the succession _ the first instance of
hereditary succession in a communist system _ was only now made
official.
</P>
<P>
   But, for Korea watchers, the arrangements under which he took
control were quite surprising.
</P>
<P>
   First, the position of president has been eternally reserved for
the deceased leader, Kim Il Sung. Second, the chairman of the
Military Commission, the position to which Kim Jong Il was
re-elected, assumes the function of head of state. Finally, the
chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly (Parliament) performs the
ceremonial functions of representing the country internationally.
</P>
<P>
   These arrangements have great symbolic meaning in North Korea
and might provide some insight into future behavior on the part of
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement eternally reserving the position of president
for Kim Il Sung, rather than abolishing it, supports the
often-heard pronouncement from North Korea that ``the Great Leader
is living with the people forever.'' This move is consistent with
the theological tone emerging in ``Juche,'' the guiding ideology of
North Korea, which frequently mentions the concept of eternal life.
The moves also signal that Kim Jong Il can never be independent of
his father and that the two will always be perceived as one in the
eyes of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unclear whether the younger Kim has ever achieved
the level of support achieved by his father, he should be able to
benefit from this linkage to his father's charismatic leadership
and legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Also of significance is the promotion of the position of
chairman of the Military Commission to the head of state. This
sends a signal that the military clearly occupies a central
position in the government. There will be no civilian-military
strife and there should be no ambiguity as to where the ultimate
authority rests.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of extreme nationalism and militarism can be
explosive and is causing concern around the world. North Korea has
a strong military possessing weapons of mass destruction, and, as
evidenced last week with the launching of the Taepo Dong missile
over Japan, now has improved delivery capabilities. Even in the
face of impossible odds, North Korea has never been timid about
standing up to the rest of the world, behavior that often causes
jitters around the region. This transition will do nothing to calm
these fears.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant factor in this succession is that although
Kim Jong Il has officially assumed the position as head of state,
it is clear that he will rarely be seen in public and will avoid
excessive media exposure or exposure to foreign leaders. These
functions will be handled primarily by the chairman of the Supreme
People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   This will enable the North Koreans to construct for Kim Jong Il
the charismatic, almost mythical, leadership qualities held by his
father without much, if any, public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   All of these arrangements signal that the world should not
expect any dramatic leadership changes or policy shifts from North
Korea. Kim Jong Il's power will remain absolute as the chief of
state and the commander of the military. His authority will be
unquestioned and unshakable as it is supported by the eternal
authority of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now that North Korea has officially completed the process of
succession, it is the obligation of the new government, if it is to
maintain its legitimacy and support of the people, to develop
policies to overcome the critical food shortage in the country and
to rehabilitate the health of its people.
</P>
<P>
   While North Korea is clearly the most unpredictable system on
the planet, the dire conditions in which its people now live make
it at least in part the responsibility of the community of nations
to find a way to work with, not alienate, the North Korean
leadership. This will require wisdom and empathy on the part of all
parties concerned, including especially North Korea itself.
</P>
<P>
   Han S. Park, one of the nation's leading experts on North Korea,
directs the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University
of Georgia. He has traveled to North Korea frequently and is a
consultant for ABC News.

IRS NOW SAYS NO TAX ON RECORD-BREAKING BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-McGWIRE, BBO-VECSEY-COLUMN.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It ain't so, the IRS said Tuesday. The fan who
grabs the home run that breaks Roger Maris' record will not face a
huge tax bill if he or she turns the ball over to the player who
hits it.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a public relations debacle, the tax-collection agency
put out a statement Tuesday afternoon explaining the ``basic income
and gift tax principles'' that would apply to a fan who ends up
with the historic ball and returns it. Its interpretation of those
principles Tuesday was far more favorable to such a fan than the
more literal-minded interpretation that the IRS had previously said
might apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the fan in these circumstances would not have
taxable income,'' the agency said, deflating legions of IRS bashers
who had already worked themselves into a high dudgeon over reports
that the lucky fan could face a tax bill of hundreds of thousands
of dollars just for turning the ball over to Mark McGwire of the
St. Louis Cardinals or Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said snagging the ball and giving it back would, for
legal purposes, be like winning a sweepstakes but declining the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would likewise be no gift tax in these circumstances,''
the agency said, adding that the tax consequences would be
different if the fan tried to cash in by selling the ball. By some
estimates, the ball could be worth $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes pieces of the tax code can be as hard to understand
as the infield fly rule,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti.
``All I know is that the fan who gives back the home run ball
deserves a round of applause, not a big tax bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who has been trying to reshape the agency into a
customer-friendly service center for taxpayers, acted after members
of both parties in Washington took turns Tuesday mocking and
criticizing the IRS for even allowing the issue to come up.
</P>
<P>
   Although the IRS has said all along that it will have to look at
all the circumstances before determining the tax implications of
the ball that breaks the single-season record of 61 home runs, it
had done little until Tuesday to dispel the impression that it
would apply the laws and regulations strictly. Treating the
baseball like any other valuable gift would have meant slapping a
tax of as much as 40 percent of the ball's value, although the
donor could have chosen to reduce his or her liability by using the
$625,000 lifetime exemption on gifts available to all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the IRS made its announcement Tuesday, White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said the possibility of the agency's
stepping into a moment in baseball history was ``about the dumbest
thing I've ever heard in my life.'' House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri said that ``only the IRS could turn a
once-in-a-lifetime catch into a once-in-a-lifetime Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who led hearings over the last year
into abuses of taxpayers by the IRS, said he had called Rossotti
Tuesday to urge him to avoid invoking tax provisions ``that defy
common sense and are patently unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was ever even the possibility of Mark
McGwire's historical 62nd home run baseball being taxed,'' Roth
said, ``is a prime example of what is wrong with our current tax
code.''

AGASSI DEFEAT LEAVES OPEN FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Night and day,'' as Sinatra used to croon, ``you
are the one.'' But the ``you'' the folks at Flushing Meadow wanted
so badly _ Andre Agassi _ was not the one after a night and day of
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In the roaring traffic boom, in the silence of their lonely
room, they thought of him. But those plaintive and positive
thoughts went the way of so many love affairs, dashed on the rocks,
breaking up Tuesday on the green hardrock rectangle within Louis
Armstrong Stadium where he had won their hearts and the title four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament is over,'' a woman lamented as Andre plopped a
last feckless backhand into the net. She was far from alone in her
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Kucera, a gangling 6-foot-3-inch blond who couldn't get
out of the first round in Boston a couple of weeks ago, didn't
quite see it that way after his triumph in two acts, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7
(5-7), 1-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In Bratislava, Slovakia, where he originated 24 years ago, it
appears to the good burghers that their favorite son is in the
quarterfinals of the US Open against Pete Sampras (whom he beat at
the Australian Open) and that business here will be conducted
through Sunday _ even though Andre is over.
</P>
<P>
   It took Monday night and Tuesday afternoon to determine how over
Andre is.
</P>
<P>
   Andre was over in the third game of the last set. He and Karol
agreed on that. He let a floundering Kucera escape from two break
points (15-40) that would have given Agassi a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no confidence when I was down there, 0-2, 15-40. I
needed a couple of points to get my confidence back,'' Kucera said.
Agassi _ ``I needed that game to keep control'' _ helped with a
couple of sloppy backhands, and Karol anted a big forehand and an
ace.
</P>
<P>
   For the pigeon-toed, balding, yet unquestionably appealing
husband of actress Brooke Shields, plus the 9,600 Agassians
cramming the arena, it was a two-act tragedy. Probably also for his
smooshy shoemaking crowd, suffering at long distance in Beaverton,
Ore. (even though Kucera works for the same haberdasher).
</P>
<P>
   Act I, Monday night, had a suspenseful scenario during which the
hero tried every playground scuffle to psyche out Kucera _
moonballs, mimicking his foe, some stalling _ all to the audience's
joy. Possibly, it was a rewrite of ``Winning Ugly,'' a primer by
his coach, Brad Gilbert. It worked. Two points from defeat in the
tie-breaker, Agassi steadied and grabbed the set, then a 3-0 edge
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the curtain came down too soon in a Charlton Heston special
effect. Like Moses, Kucera was saved by water. ``I was a little bit
lucky that it was rain coming,'' he said. ``It was very tough when
Andre turned the match around, tough for me to stay concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt like Moses among the Egyptians. ``I was fighting against
the crowd. I was very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Act II, a dry, sunny Tuesday afternoon, promised salvation as
Agassi banged out five straight games to within one point of making
it all come true. However, there was to be no happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Andre's fight from two sets behind a yellow 8-ball and
persistent delaying of defeat until the foozled fifth set, his
``Wait till next year!'' claque will have to comfort themselves
with a 1998 campaign in which Agassi phoenixed his way out of the
ash heap and flapped from No. 141 back to the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, though, it was back to steerage when you consider how
he futilely performed on the first-class occasions: Australian,
fourth round to Alberto Berasategui; French, first round to
qualifier Marat Safin; Wimbledon, second round to Tommy Haas. Now
Kucera. Pinned by not exactly pinup boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about how you play at the right times vs. my game,''
said Andre straightforwardly. ``By my normal standards, it's
certainly been a bad year. I've got to keep it in context because
of how long it's been since I've been competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year has gone to set me up for what I'm hoping to be now,
the next level in my game _ I'm talking a few years of great
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody hopes so. But it was shocking that he couldn't take
advantage of Kucera's serve when it went wobbly. Karol missed 20 of
27 first balls at one stretch in the fifth and decided just to put
the ball in play at speeds that wouldn't get you arrested in a
school zone.
</P>
<P>
   They took turns getting tight in the fifth, and Agassi won that
phase as the big Slovak outhit and outran him right out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Still, night and day, Andre's the one, the male tennis passion
for his countryfolk.

RAFTER, NOVOTNA ADVANCE WITH WORKMANLIKE WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While Andre Agassi was playing to a full house in a
side stadium, Patrick Rafter and Jana Novotna were workmanlike on
the main stage.
</P>
<P>
   No moonballs. No mimicking the ball tosses of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Just cool confidence born of tennis titles. Major titles.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter won his first, and thus far only, Grand Slam crown here
last year. Novotna, long known as a player who had trouble
finishing off big matches, took care of that reputation with her
first at Wimbledon in July.
</P>
<P>
   Both, not surprisingly, liked the feeling. And both are on track
to feel it again.
</P>
<P>
   While Agassi lost to Karol Kucera, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 1-6,
6-3, and messed up a quarterfinal marquee matchup with Pete
Sampras, Rafter eliminated Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. He
plays Jonas Bjorkman, a 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 winner over Jan
Siemerink.
</P>
<P>
   In other fourth-round matches, unseeded Thomas Johansson and
Mark Philipoussis advanced with upsets and will meet in a
quarterfinal. Johansson beat No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 3-6, 6-3,
6-3, 7-6 (9-7), and Philippoussis took out No. 13 Tim Henman, 7-5,
0-6, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Larsson beat Oliver Gross, 6-4, 7-5, 5-7, 6-2, to make it
three unseeded players in the bottom half of the draw. Larsson
plays the winner of last night's match between No. 7 Alex Corretja
and No. 10 Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, seeded third, crushed the No. 11 seed, Steffi
Graf-slayer Patty Schnyder, 6-2, 6-3. Novotna plays the winner of
Tuesday night's match between two-time winner Monica Seles and
defending champion Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter welcomed the Monday night storm that suspended his match
until Tuesday. On Monday night, the huge-serving Ivanisevic seemed
to be heating up, Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Ivanisevic was that any serving success was
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   His answer when asked the difference in the match was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serve,'' Ivanisevic said. ``Yeah, I had maybe 40 percent first
serves in. I cannot play on the junior girls with that kind of
percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the numbers right. He put in 40 percent of his first
serves for the match and had only 25 percent in the fourth set.
Rafter put in 75 percent of his first serves in the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's confident,'' Ivanisevic said. ``He's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Rafter came here after a summer of getting to five
tournament finals and losing them all. This summer he won all three
finals he made, including two last month.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he's riding his serve-and-volley game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm probably serving just a little bit smarter than
what I was last year,'' he said. ``I was serving very well last
year. But this year I can maintain that with consistency and just
sort of mixing it up a lot better, volleying really well, moving
well, just playing a smart game when I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic will attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, who turns 30 next month, is on the top of her game,
too, and is putting together a career year. She went to the
quarterfinals at the French Open and then won three straight
titles, including Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, you know, winning a Grand Slam gives you confidence,
not only for the next couple of weeks, but it gives you confidence
for life,'' Novotna said. ``You know, not too many people can do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer, Novotna said, is she hearing herself referred to as a
choker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I hear it in six weeks,'' she said. ``I
didn't hear it for such a long time and it really felt good. Every
time I do a press conference or I'm recognized by somebody,
(there's) not a word about anything in the past, only the present
time, which is great. I have been waiting a long time to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience and age, Novotna felt, didn't hurt at all against
Schnyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected a much harder match, there's no question about
it,'' she said. ``But I also knew that after beating Steffi, she
may have a letdown a little bit because she's not as experienced.
She's still very young. In the future, she will be a great player.
But at this moment, she just simply didn't know how to handle the
whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, by the way, didn't mind at all that Schnyder ousted
Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased, I must say, when I heard the news that she
beat Steffi,'' she said. ``There's no question about it. I mean,
playing Steffi today in these weather conditions would be really
difficult because she hits really hard and she's very overpowering.
It would be much harder for me to create my game.''
</P>
<P>
   She had little problem doing that Tuesday.

BUSINESSES FIND THAT RELIGION CAN HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN THE
WORKPLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDRA BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Down a short hallway wide enough for only
one person, tucked between the executive offices and the plant
floor at Leaman Container in Fort Worth, is a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   With dark brown paneling, a cross and kneeler, it is lit by only
a table lamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's available for the 70 employees of the cardboard box
manufacturer to take a brief respite during the day for prayer or
meditation _ if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Don Leaman says he isn't trying to convert anyone to his
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how much it's used,'' he says. ``Nobody
keeps track.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leaman says he wants to provide a place for his employees to
feel free to express their spirituality at work. He says he wants
them to know that he cares about them and that the workplace ``is
not just a place to come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many business owners are trying to find ways to help employees
find balance between work and home.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when spirituality plays a strong role in
someone's life?
</P>
<P>
   Once reserved for religious settings or the home, spirituality
is finding its way into the workplace, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Susan White, a professor of worship and spirituality at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth, says employers are taking a
much more holistic attitude toward employees, offering spiritual
assistance as a benefit, just as they would child care and job
flexibility to help people balance their work and family lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't leave bits of themselves at the door,'' White
says. ``Employers are recognizing that people's spirituality and
family do matter to them. All those kinds of things enhance
employees' well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Ballard, a professsor of the New Testament at Texas Wesleyan
University in Fort Worth, says because public displays of religious
expression have increased and more people are willing to be visible
and vocal about their faith, ``it's only a short step to the
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   White says that is especially true now that people of all faiths
find themselves working together.
</P>
<P>
   Marketplace Ministries founder Gil Stricklin says employers'
desire to help meet their employees' spiritual needs has sparked
tremendous growth for his company, which provides chaplain services
in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   He says Marketplace Ministries adds a company to its client list
every 10 days, and he can't hire chaplains fast enough to handle
requests. Founded in Dallas in 1984, it has locations in 176 cities
in 35 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, employers are seeing spirituality in the
workplace is a very, very positive thing,'' Stricklin says. ``Life
is tough, and when it knocks you down, you need someone to help you
up.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Lutheran Brotherhood, a
Minneapolis-based insurance company that serves primarily
Lutherans, 70 percent of respondents said they talk about faith in
the workplace. Half said those talks take place at least once a
month, and 19 percent said they talk about religion with their
co-workers at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   But allowing employees an outlet for religious expression in the
workplace can create subtle pressures, even if unintentional, for
those employees who don't participate, to conform, White says.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, White recommends that companies set policies that
spell out how they will handle religion-related requests and
activities and make sure that employees understand that not
participating will not adversely affect their job evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult thing that's swirling around it,'' White
says. ``You can't make it a condition of work. It needs to be a
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketplace Ministries' Berl Pedigo, the chaplain at Leaman
Containers, says he has to overcome initial hesitancy among
employees when he goes into a company. He says he walks through,
stopping to chat with them for a moment. If they want his help,
they let him know, Pedigo says. If not, or if they don't even want
to talk, he moves on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When starting in a new workplace, employees are suspicious,''
he says. ``They think we're spies. But I keep at it. I come back
and say `Hello' and walk on until a comfort level sinks in.''
</P>
<P>
   He has performed weddings, funerals and visited employees in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Brooks, who began working at Leaman Containers only four
months ago, says she was surprised, yet pleased, to learn about the
chaplain services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some great talks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Auto dealer James Wood, who operates showrooms in Decatur and
Denton, says he turned to Marketplace Ministries a couple of years
ago when it became too difficult for him and his wife to continue
counseling employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wood says that when he told his managers that he was going to
begin offering chaplain services, no one said a word, pro or con.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wood says, if he tried to cut the program, those same
managers would step forward and plead to keep it in place. Jobs and
marriages have been saved because employees were able to seek the
professional help they needed through the chaplain, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how big a change they made,'' Wood says. ``It shows we
care about them. We want employees to live like Christians at work.
That makes a difference to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a spiritual work force is also important to Steve Harms,
president of RIM Manufacturing in Weatherford, just west of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Harms says it is part of his stewardship that he meet the
spiritual needs of his employees. He began using Marketplace
Ministries in June for his 37-employee work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt that the businesses we have, they're owned
by God, anyway,'' Harms says. ``We are to share our faith, but not
share it in a way that is causing someone else to feel they are
being attacked. Things aren't done just for the sake of the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has no idea how many of his employees have talked to
the chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be having a tremendous impact,'' he says. ``Truly, I
don't know conversations and I never see him.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's important to many business owners that they run their
businesses on the religious principles they live by, Stricklin
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more employers, men and women of faith, want to
extend their faith to the lives of their employees and families,''
he says. ``It's a great business decision. It's a great Christian
decision. It's a great faith decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schaefer, principal in Blanchard Schaefer Advertising &AMP;
Public Relations in Arlington, says he and his two partners sat
down and talked about their Christian beliefs and what part they
would play in their business before the three agreed to the venture
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important to all three of us,'' Schaefer says.
``It puts you on a common page. As partners, our faith manifests
itself in how we do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says he starts and ends the day with a prayer and reads
a daily devotional book when he starts his day at the office. He
says his employees are free to share e-mails that might contain a
parable or a Bible verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about forced faith,'' he says. ``We're all in search
of peace. We want our lives to be balanced and in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says faith is not used as a shield but manifests itself
in a desire to do the right thing _ particularly for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very much a biblically based principle,'' Schaefer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington attorney Tim Kolton has placed statues of St. Joseph,
the patron saint of workers, in each room in his office, as a
reminder throughout the day of his faith. He says his clients
rarely mention or ask about the statues, but says he would have no
hesitation talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my good luck charm,'' he says. ``I've always had
something to do and have kept busy.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sam Emmerson, owner of PML Permite Corp., a five-employee
industrial chemical manufacturing company in Fort Worth, says
providing a spiritual foundation can help employees, who are
constantly faced with contradictions and dilemmas in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerson, who speaks to business groups and others on the topic,
``Faith in the Workplace,'' says employers shouldn't expect
employees to compromise truth and integrity in their work.
</P>
<P>
   It goes down to even those little white lies, such as when a
boss tells his assistant to say he's not in his office when he
really is, Emmerson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times does that happen, and that's a small one,''
Emmerson says. ``Things like this is what we're all up against.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmerson says he recently found himself in a position that
tested those principles. In checking bookkeeping, it was discovered
that his company inadvertently overcharged a customer $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   He says that as soon as the mistake was discovered, he went to
the company, admitted the error and the mistake was taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you have to bite the bullet,'' he says. ``The
bottom line is you're being honest. I'm not pious. The only thing I
tell you is I'm honest and I have integrity.''

   With an announcement that is already producing applause and
handwringing, doctors at a fertility center near Washington will
report on Wednesday that they can substantially stack the odds that
a couple can have a baby of the sex they choose.
</P>
<P>
   The method, developed by the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute in
Fairfax, Va., involves sorting sperm by the amount of DNA they
contain and then using them for artificial insemination. It
capitalizes on the fact that there is only one difference between
sperm that carry the Y chromosome, which produces males, and those
with an X-chromosome, which produces females: sperm with a Y
chromosome have about 2.8 percent less genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators report that if they select for X-bearing
sperm, they end up with sperm samples in which 85 percent of the
cells have an X-chromosome. If they select for Y-bearing sperm, the
result is a sperm sample in which 65 percent of the cells contain a
Y-chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper being published on Wednesday in the journal Human
Reproduction, the investigators, led by Dr. Edward Fugger, report
results for couples who wanted girls. Of 14 pregnancies that
progressed far enough for doctors to determine the fetus' sex, 13
had only female fetuses. Ten out of the 11 babies that were born so
far were girls.
</P>
<P>
   Fugger said that the group has produced about the same number of
pregnancies for couples who wanted boys and that the results are
consistent with what the sperm sorting would predict. But, he said,
the investigators are not releasing the results of those
pregnancies until they are published in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sex selection techniques have been promoted and
marketed for decades. But, said Dr. Alan DeCherney, the chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California at Los
Angeles and the editor of the journal Fertility and Sterility,
``Nothing worked until now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute, a private, for-profit medical
center, is a leader in fertility research and prides itself in
being among the first to offer new reproductive techniques. Fugger
noted that before his group began using the sperm sorting
technique, hundreds of animals of a variety of species had been
born using the method and that there was no evidence that it caused
birth defects. But other fertility experts raised questions about
the ethical quandaries opened up with a decision to provide sex
selection and whether the animal tests were adequate to show safety
to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Sex selection has been used for millennia, with folk remedies
that supposedly guaranteed a baby of a particular sex, female
infanticide and, more recently, the abortion of fetuses because of
their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Decade after decade, so many groups have claimed that they had a
method for sex selection that the entire field became tainted, said
Dr. Richard Rawlins, the director of the in vitro fertilization
laboratories at Rush University in Chicago. Most recently, claims
that male sperm could be separated because they swim faster were
found to be without scientific basis.
</P>
<P>
   To sift sperm, researchers at the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute
stained their DNA and then used a cell sorter that lined up sperm
individually in a stream, where each sperm's DNA content was
measured and the X-containing sperm separated from those with a
Y-chromosome. The scientists said it takes most of a day to sort
the approximately 200 million wriggling sperm of a single ejaculate
as they pass single file through the machine's DNA detector.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Schulman, director of the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute,
said most of the couples wanted to choose their baby's sex for
``family balancing.'' A few wanted sex selection because they were
at risk of having babies with genetic diseases that afflict boys
almost exclusively, he said. Schulman said that, so far, the
institute was not offering the method to couples who have no
children and want a first child of a particular sex, but he did not
rule out that use in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Collins of Gainesville, Va., was one of the first to
have sperm sorting, in March 1995. She had two sons, who were aged
2 and 6, and urgently wanted a daughter. ``Having a daughter for me
was like having a baby for some people, that's how important it
was,'' she said. She and her husband, Scott Collins, had a girl on
Aug. 13, 1996, after Collins' sperm was sorted at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia researchers are using a technique whose development
began 16 years ago, when Dr. Lawrence Johnson, a scientist at the
Department of Agriculture's research service in Beltsville, Md.,
began working on a sperm separation method. His goal was to do sex
selection for farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson labeled the DNA in sperm cells with a temporary,
nontoxic, fluorescent chemical. Once that chemical was in the sperm
cells, they would glow blue under a laser light. The more light
that was emitted when the laser shined on a sperm cell, the more
DNA the cell contained. That gave Johnson a way to detect small
differences in DNA content. He modified a cell sorting machine so
that it would detect it.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial interests soon stepped in. In 1996, the Colorado
State Research Foundation and Cytomation Inc. of Fort Collins
formed a company, XY Inc., and appointed Dr. George Seidel, a
professor of physiology at Colorado State University as scientific
director. They plan to use the sperm selection method for breeding
animals, starting with cows and horses.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to sort cow and horse sperm than human sperm,
Seidel said, because the DNA difference between X and Y sperm is
more marked. In cows, X-bearing sperm have 3.8 percent more DNA
than Y-bearing sperm and in horses, X-bearing sperm have 4.1
percent more DNA, whereas the difference in human sperm is just 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it works,'' Seidel said. Molecular
biological studies indicate that more than 90 percent of the X and
Y bearing animal sperm are sorted correctly, he said. ``We just
checked the pregnancies on 30 animals and just one was the wrong
sex,'' Seidel said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute began their program
five years ago, licensing the method and modifying the machine to
sort human sperm. The first couple they assisted wanted a daughter
because the woman carried a gene for a rare disease, X-linked
hydrocephalus, that strikes boys almost exclusively. Two of her
brothers had died of the disease and so had two of her sons. Using
sperm sorting, she and her husband had a healthy girl who is now
almost 3, said Dr. Susan Black, a geneticist and infertility
specialist at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the encouraging results so far with human sperm
sorting, the reactions of some fertility experts indicated that the
Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute might be stepping into an ethical
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sex selection, DeCherney said, ``most people
feel this is tampering with nature,'' and find it abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   And unexpected ethical issues can arise, said Rawlins, the in
vitro fertilization laboratory director at Rush Medical College. In
the early 1990s, Rawlins and his colleagues offered couples a
method of sex selection, which did not turn out to efficiently sort
sperm. Rawlins said he and his colleagues saw sex-selection as a
way to help couples who had genes that could cause sex-linked
diseases to have normal children. In addition, Rawlins said, he and
his colleagues thought it would be acceptable to offer sex
selection to couples who had already had two or three children of
one sex and who wanted a baby of the other sex.
</P>
<P>
   But, Rawlins said, he learned that some couples in whom the
method failed were aborting their fetuses. He ended his program.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Genetics &AMP; IVF patients who wanted girls have
aborted fetuses of the undesired sex although one couple who wanted
a boy aborted a female fetus, Dr. Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Zirkin, who heads the division of reproductive biology
at Johns Hopkins University's School of Hygiene and Public Health
in Baltimore, Md., said he remains to be convinced about the safety
of the method, which involves staining sperm's DNA and piercing the
sperm with a laser.
</P>
<P>
   Fugger said that when the institute began offering the treatment
to people ``there had been more than 300 animals born. Now there
are more than 400 animals in five different species and there are
no adverse effects in any of them.'' And, he added, ``we currently
have normal healthy babies. Our experience is the same as the
experience in animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zirkin said several hundred animals is not enough to pick up
a rare or subtle defect. It is one thing, he said, to use
experimental methods for infertile couples who could not have
babies any other way. But, he said, ``to me, sex selection is
another category.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not curing a disease and it's not curing a societal
problem,'' Zirkin said. ``There is no reason for haste and every
reason to be cautious.''

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Well before Swissair Flight 111 hit the
water last Wednesday night, a computerized black box that tracks
dozens of functions on the big MD-11 recorded system after system
breaking down, the chief investigator said on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   While the box, the flight data recorder, sat near the tail and
silently tracked over 250 different characteristics, up front, in
the smoke-filled cockpit, the two pilots were striving to find
their problem and simultaneously prepare for an unexpected approach
to an unfamiliar airport. A transcript released on Tuesday shows at
least a touch of frantic confusion slipping in. At one point, the
pilots broadcast a conversation between the two of them, in German,
to a puzzled air traffic controller on the ground; and, at another
point, both decided to talk to the controller at once.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still hoping to recover the other black box,
the cockpit voice recorder, but rough weather kept divers out of
the water on Tuesday. But with enough analysis, said the chief
investigator, Vic Gerden, of Canada's Transportation Safety Board,
the details from the box that Canadian navy divers brought up on
Sunday may reveal where the plane's problem began, even if the box
quit six minutes before the plane crashed five miles off the coast
near here. But Gerden said that investigators in his
data-processing laboratory in Ottawa were working backwards from
the end of the data and had not yet determined where, on the
25-hour record (a period that could cover three previous flights)
the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Gerden confirmed that fire-damaged parts that
were collected along the shoreline here are from the airplane; in
fact, they are ``heat-damaged'' parts from the cockpit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a transcript released by the board of the last 27 minutes
of communication between the Geneva-bound jet and air traffic
controllers shows some confusion on both sides of the conversation,
it was not immediately evident if the errors made any difference to
the outcome of the flight. All 229 people on the plane were killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The portion of the air traffic control communications released
on Tuesday begins with the plane, about half an hour out of Kennedy
International Airport in New York, using standard language to
introduce itself to a controller at a high-altitude control center
in Moncton, New Brunswick, as ``Swissair one-eleven heavy.'' Heavy
means any plane over 300,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The plane reports in at 58 minutes after midnight, Greenwich
mean time, or just before 10 p.m. here, and just before 9 p.m. in
New York. All proceeds normally until a pilot says the flight is
``declaring Pan Pan Pan,'' the call sign for an urgent problem, 16
minutes later. The pilot _ no one knows yet if it was the captain
or the first officer _ says he wants to go to ``a convenient place,
I guess Boston.'' Controllers limit each altitude to planes going
in a single direction, and the controller clears the Swissair
flight to descend from 33,000 feet to 31,000, an altitude
appropriate for traffic headed to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty seconds after Swissair's initial call, the controller,
with a much better idea of the MD-11's location, says, ``uh, would
you prefer to go into Halifax,'' which is about as close to an
order as an air traffic controller gives a plane in trouble; thirty
seconds later, Swissair accepts the suggestion. ``Speedbird,'' a
call sign for a supersonic Concorde, is listening in, and the
British Air crew supplies Swissair with weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid what is undoubtedly a very heavy workload in the cockpit,
the Swissair pilot has to ask twice for the wind direction and the
radio frequency for the instrument landing system at Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   An open question for investigators _ and armchair accident
analysts _ is whether the plane could have begun dumping fuel
earlier, to get the plane's weight down to the manufacturer's
recommended maximum for landing, or should have bothered dumping at
all, if it delayed a landing. In Canada, Gerden said on Tuesday
evening, planes may dump fuel if they are above 2,000 feet above
ground level, and the plane need not have circled the water to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilot asks, at 1:21:30, ``we, uh, must dump some fuel.
May we do that in this area during descent?'' the controller does
not immediately answer, but asks if the plane can turn left or
right for a previously-discussed circle to lose altitude. The pilot
says, ``we are able for a left or right turn towards the south to
dump,'' a course that will take them out to sea. The controller
tells them they will be over the coast in 10 miles, and that they
should advise him when they are ready to dump. The pilot does not
say he is beginning dumping until 1:24:56, almost three minutes
later, at which time the controller tells him, `just a couple of
miles I'll be right with you,'' and thirty seconds after that, the
controller tells the crew to begin dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling moment is when (at 1:22:36) a pilot has
evidently keyed the microphone for transmission to the ground while
discussing with the other pilot, in German, whether they are
performing the emergency checklist for smoke, a confusion
equivalent to trying to carry on two telephone conversations
simultaneously and putting the wrong one on hold.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After winning a writing Oscar (and a Best Actor
nomination) for ``Good Will Hunting'' and playing the title role in
the most admired film of the summer, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' is there anything left that could impress Matt
Damon?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Losing his shirt at the World Series of Poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that level, it's like playing basketball with Michael
Jordan or something,'' says Damon, who portrays a world-class, if
reluctant, card sharp in his latest movie, ``Rounders.'' ``You can
tell you're totally outgunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon and co-star Edward Norton were invited to play in the
annual Las Vegas event. Johnny Chan, the 1997 and '98 world
champion, was an adviser and makes a brief appearance in the film.
But even though Chan taught the actors many of the skills that make
poker much more like chess than other games of chance, the young
guys from Hollywood went in knowing they didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it for us was that we were probably the
only two guys there who weren't entertaining the fantasy of winning
it,'' Damon says. ``It's $10,000 to get into the tournament, and
the casino waived that for us, so it was the ultimate way to take
in the experience; I would never put my own money on the line
having met these guys. There's just no way that I'd ever win.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't. After surviving to the end of the series' first
day, Damon bet all he had on two kings in the hole, then lost to a
pro holding aces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great way to lose because I went out on a good
hand,'' Damon says. ``Edward and I just wanted to lose in a
dignified way and not make fools of ourselves, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   And they made a new friend in the process. Sort of. ``Johnny
Chan invited us to come play with him at any time,'' Damon says.
``But that's the kind of thing where it's like, you know, thanks
but no thanks.''

PLAYING IT CLOSE TO THE VEST

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's that time in Edward Norton's short but
outstanding career to take on the obligatory sleazeball role.
</P>
<P>
   He's done Yale (though his fields of study were history and
Japanese, not at the university's storied drama school). He quickly
rose through the ranks of famed playwright Edward Albee's New York
theater company.
</P>
<P>
   Then Norton made his movie debut as a brilliantly deceptive
sociopath in ``Primal Fear,'' and earned an Oscar nomination for
it. This was followed by the anointment-like casting in a Woody
Allen project (``Everyone Says I Love You'') and a showy courtroom
bit as the most decent guy, despite being a lawyer, in ``The People
vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   So now comes ``Rounders,'' a gritty film about professional
poker players in which Norton gets to play a trouble-seeking
jailbird appropriately called Worm. A brilliant card player who
nonetheless can't resist cheating, Worm is the wayward
anti-conscience of his best friend and equally genius poker
partner, Matt Damon's conflicted law student Mike McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Scrawny Worm favors grungy, brown leather jackets and is
perpetually in need of a shave and, probably, a shower. He's
constantly in hock to underworld types, and almost seems to enjoy
the occasional beatings he so eminently asks for. The character
recalls ``Midnight Cowboy's'' Ratso Rizzo and ``Mean Streets'''
Johnny Boy, similarly scummy roles Norton's idols Dustin Hoffman
and Robert De Niro played at equivalent points in their early
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Except that this guy's a little different, at least according to
Norton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Worm fits in a fine tradition of lovable rogues; I
don't think he views himself as a loser,'' the unassuming but
articulate 29-year-old actor says. ``This'll sound funny, but it's
actually very serious: I had this operating image of Bugs Bunny in
my mind with Worm, but dressed as Keith Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always need to find a line in on a character, and Bugs
Bunny is always scheming, always two steps ahead of a beating and
always laughing. Worm is completely comfortable with who he is in a
deep, conscious, philosophic sense. He accepts and declares that
the game for him is not poker but the hustle, and he loves it. He
loves the running and the hiding; he's living the way he wants to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   This is part of what makes Norton such an amusing and magnetic
actor: an ability to defend a Looney Tunes concept with
intellectualized, persuasive logic. And he obviously has the talent
to put that into his performances as well as he puts it into words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Norton is very professional and disciplined,'' says
Oscar-winning actor Martin Landau, who appears in ``Rounders'' and
has taught acting to the likes of Jack Nicholson and James Dean.
``You can see in his work attention to detail and a certain kind of
focus that's special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the scenes with Edward ... I just love watching him
in the movie and I loved watching him while we were making it,''
co-star Damon, as hot as can be after writing and starring in
``Good Will Hunting'' and playing the title role in ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' reveals. ``He brought a lot of levity to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton is perhaps having a harder time keeping the laugh level
up these days. Though a cordial conversationalist, he clearly takes
great umbrage to personal questions _ and he's gotten a good deal
of them since being romantically linked to his attention-attracting
``Larry Flynt'' co-star Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a distraction,'' Norton says. ``Sometimes I
just find myself unimpressed with people's narrow-mindedness or
their presumption, frankly. The bottom line is: You don't know who
my girlfriend is; you don't have any idea and you're probably
wrong. But people will presume all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it is, and at the end of the day you've
just got to let it fly right on by you. It's not relevant, it
doesn't actually come in and impact your life, minute-to-minute,
all that often. You just have to try to draw boundaries as
positively as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Some information has gotten past the boundaries. Norton was
raised in Columbia, Md., by a lawyer father and an English teacher
mother (both parents have worked for the public good, too, dad for
the Carter administration and National Trust for Historic
Preservation and his late mom for the grant-distributing Abell
Foundation).
</P>
<P>
   Norton's grandfather, James Rouse, founded the company that
created the planned community of Columbia and such urban
destinations as New York's South Street Seaport. He also started
the Enterprise Foundation, an outfit dedicated to creating
low-income housing, of which Norton is a board member.
</P>
<P>
   And Norton lived a year in Japan. Anything else about him, he
likes to keep a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But he's more than eager to tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from an instinct that all that stuff absolutely
gets in the way of everything I'm trying to achieve on a creative
level,'' Norton says. ``Which is, very distinct characters that you
can get lost in without the inflection and interference of what you
know about me. That's a very conscious choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But sometimes, things happen that demand
addressing, even if they might distract from or influence a
film-watching experience.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case with Norton's next release, ``American History
X.'' A searing examination of contemporary racism, in which Norton
plays a reformed Nazi skinhead trying to prevent his younger
brother (``Terminator 2's'' Edward Furlong) from following his path
of hatred. The film has been quite publicly disowned by its
first-time director, English conceptual artist Tony Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kaye has been taking out alternately inscrutable and
imploring ads in the Hollywood trade papers asking Norton and the
film's other creative contributors to side with him against New
Line Cinema, ``X's'' bankroller. New Line plans Oct. 30 to release
a cut of the film Kaye submitted; Kaye has demanded more time and
money to do re-shoots and re-edits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Directors Guild of America made the highly
unusual decision to deny Kaye's request to replace his name with
Alan Smithee, the official pseudonym used when a director doesn't
want to acknowledge authorship of a film. Kaye responded with an
effort to have the movie credited to Humpty Dumpty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recognize that Tony is as sincerely committed to
hype art and concept art as he is as a filmmaker,'' Norton
observes, with a chuckle, about the man whose ``art installations''
include hiring homeless people to appear at London's Tate Gallery
and L.A.'s Getty Museum. ``It's almost hilarious _ and somewhat
strange _ that he's chosen to target his own movie with his hype
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton denies reports that he was heavily involved in some
editing sessions of the film, and that that was partially
responsible for Kaye's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be honest. My involvement in it is really rather
limited,'' Norton says. ``This thing that has gone on is between
him and the studio. I do think that it's funny that he's presented
it as a big chasm between his film and their film, because the film
they have is his film, the last cut that he delivered, sort of,
before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the film that he gave them is amazing. I am
so proud of this movie, and thrilled about everything Tony did. He
shot it too, and it's visually one of the most unique films I've
seen in a long time. It's a very, very wrenching movie, and I hope
people will let it speak for itself without trying to second-guess
everything that went on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things in the movie business, Norton is learning, can spin out
of one's control. Nevertheless, he's trying to have more influence
on his films. Following his next picture, ``The Fight Club,''
co-starring Brad Pitt and directed by ``Seven's'' David Fincher,
he'll produce as well as star in ``Keeping the Faith,'' a romantic
comedy about a priest who falls in love.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he intends to turn into a control freak or anything. As
planned out as Norton's career may appear, he says there's no
method to the choices he makes. Indeed, he sounds vaguely Worm-like
when he acknowledges that even the most talented players in this
game are, in a crucial way, always gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything you do is going to be for everybody, first of
all, and that's totally fine,'' he says. ``And second of all, the
best thing about making movies is that they're collaborative and
the worst thing about making movies is that they're collaborative.
You cannot control it all, you cannot ever predict that all the
elements that go into making a film are going to gel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only know why you're going after it and what you hope
it could be and take your best shot. And you're not gonna hit it
every time; you're just not, and you've got to be grounded about
that.''

   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ Standing on her sun-dappled lawn, Celia
Winter politely dismissed President Clinton as ``a farce'' as his
motorcade arrived from the White House on a mission of preaching
education in this bastion of suburban values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disgusted with him,'' Mrs. Winter said. ``This is a
man who campaigned with his family, with Hillary, on the theme of
family values. And now it's all shot to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winter spoke more in sadness than anger, but her neighbor
down the block, Maureen Callahan, took the more demonstrative step
of tacking a hand-lettered, black-and-white announcement on her
neat picket fence: ``Embarrassed. Disheartened. Disgusted by Our
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be here with young children,'' Mrs. Callahan, who
has a young child, said as she stared disapprovingly toward
Pinecrest Elementary school, where students were assembled to cheer
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled Mr. Glendening chose not to come,'' she said of
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat seeking re-election who
shunned the event in protest of Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats rallied to the president's side, but with never
a word of the Lewinsky inquiry nor of a possible impeachment
inquiry in two hours of speechifying about education five miles to
the south inside the Washington Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to have the president here to talk about one
of the real issues,'' said Rep. Albert Wynn, D-Md., who led the
applause for Clinton. In an interview, the congressman insisted
that it was ``time to move on'' from the Lewinsky scandal. ``In my
district, folks are not interested in hype, they are not interested
in scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, energetically working the scene of cheering
students as if it were a stop in some vital new political campaign,
beamed before his invited audience of 120 teachers, parents and
other advocates for improvements in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when things are going really, really well for
people, they get a little self-indulgent and basically just want to
kick back and relax,'' Clinton declared in warning against the
neglect of education needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Wynn committed the truth up here when he said that
the first time we talked, he was hitting on me for more federal
funds for education,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   The event amounted to a respite from the investigatory travail
of Washington. But for every bit of encouragement _ ``We love
you!'' shouted one supporter as the president stepped up to speak _
there was a disapproving word or a blunt sign being offered by
surrounding residents. ``Liar! Liar!'' one homeowner announced to
the motorcade in a sign propped up by a statue of St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen pro-impeachment pickets who have been dogging the
president in Washington journeyed here to hold up a sign
proclaiming, ``Mr. President, stay away from our daughters.'' But
other outsiders came to express support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of his critics come across as puritanical,'' said Susan
Rohrer of Beltsville, watching the motorcade route with her two
daughters, ages 3 and 5. ``What they're doing is negating all the
good he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school, Maureen Hanley, a local resident, said
flatly: ``He's here because of spin control. He's got to win the
public back again. Forgive me, but I think he's a liar, and you can
watch it in his facial expressions, trying to get this to blow
over. But it's not blowing over.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside the school, the president received repeated rounds of
applause as he spoke up for higher spending on school construction
and teacher training and warned children about hollow promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child will turn on the television and hear every
politician like me saying children are the most important things to
our future, education is the most important issue,'' Clinton said.
``The actions that the child sees walking up the steps to school
every day are louder than all the words to the contrary of the
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winter, watching as the presidential caravan glided through
this sylvan tableau of family value politicking, contended that the
president was violating his own action-over-words caution. ``He's
just here in a continuation of his latest marketing scheme,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president was obviously cheered by the meticulously
planned journey beyond the Beltway, spending extra time to meet the
children assembled at his departure. In his speech, he related
their needs to a wide variety of pending issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is going to get another chance to do the right
thing on campaign finance reform,'' he said. ``I wish they would.
I'd like to see all my successors be able to spend less time
raising money and more time helping you raise your kids.''

POKEMON IS HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brace yourself, America. Another one of those
Japanese toy-craze tsunamis is about to wash over these shores,
just in time for another flood of Christmastime gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   This particular toy tidal wave is called Pokemon, and Nintendo
of America thinks it has caught a big one. So do the licensees for
everything from a ``Pokemon'' television cartoon, which debuted
Monday on KCOP (Channel 13), to plush toys.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo has been buzzing around Los Angeles and other big
cities the past week with specially outfitted cars designed to look
like the game's yellow, teddy-bearish Pikachu character, all part
of a buildup the company believes will pay off handsomely in coming
weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   And given the game's history in Japan, where Pokemon has moved
beyond a smash hit into something of a cultural phenomenon, that
expectation seems realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon _ sort of shorthand for Pocket Monsters _ sold a
whopping 8 million Game Boy units in Japan, seemingly enough to
carpet all of Tokyo with cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   There it spawned a hit cartoon series, movie, trading-card game,
million-selling music CD and comic book. More than 1,000 Pokemon
products are now being sold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see why Nintendo thinks it will hit a jackpot
with Pokemon in America, because the game itself ties together a
series of elements that together may prove well nigh irresistible
to youths.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, a player must capture, care for, even help evolve
150 different kinds of Pokemon creatures, many of them odd,
mythical hybrids with names such as Paras and Metapod.
</P>
<P>
   The game initially is like a massive version of that previous
Japanese craze, the Tamagotchi. But instead of raising just one
relatively static creature, a player must figure out how to catch,
then care for and improve as many as several dozen of widely
varying type. And once captured, a Pokemon can be used to catch
still more.
</P>
<P>
   The game's combat is based on a complex version of the old
rock-paper-scissors game, which makes choosing the right Pokemon in
a conflict a key, said Shannon O'Neil, a Nintendo game counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 Pokemon ``species'' are divided into 15 different types
_ such as fire, water, ground and plant _ that can beat some kinds
of opponents more easily than others. Even a relatively weak water
creature, for instance, can beat a strong ground Pokemon, O'Neil
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to collect all the Pokemon, a player needs to cut deals with
other players. That's because the game comes in two slightly
different versions, with different-colored cartridges _ and a
different collection of Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of just catching all the Pokemon, a player has to
make deals to get some, using a connecting cable and hard
bargaining, to swap spare Pokemon with someone who has the game's
other version.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough Pokemon of different types are amassed and improved,
a player can win the game's first phase, defeating a
computer-operated ``boss'' opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a player can take on human opponents, again using a
connecting cable to another Game Boy. Each side chooses six
champion Pokemon to fight in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself won't hit stores until late in the month. In the
meantime, the cartoon show, which runs at 7 a.m. weekdays, will be
around to get kids excited. the show, according to O'Neil, closely
follows the game in some ways, even providing clues for players
about how to catch and fight with different types of Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   So now parents can be concerned about yet another toy-based
cartoon series being used as a marketing device. But like most
tidal waves, this one looks difficult to sidestep.

IN TEXAS'S HEARTLAND, NOT ALL WILL SURVIVE RELENTLESS DROUGHT OF
'98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Old farm joke: What happens when you bet the
farm and lose?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You just make another enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Wagner Jr., 43, who farms 3,600 acres in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, retells the joke. But, frankly, there's little
laughter in his region, or in other parts of Texas, where the
Drought of '98 lingers.
</P>
<P>
   The drought came as the great leveler this year. Many farmers
are on the brink of failure, agricultural economists warn. And
August's rains in some parts of the state came too late to do much
good for this year's crops.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram recently visited farmers in three
regions _ Ellis County south of Dallas, Gaines and Dawson counties
in Northwest Texas, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley _ for a closer
look at the drought's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were considering leaving the business. Others
vowed to survive on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it even in the worst times,'' said B.J. Simpson, 73,
who grew up in the 1930s Dust Bowl days in northwest Texas and now
farms in the Rio Grande Valley. ``I love it at the worst. I always
will. It's a way of life. And it's a good life, even though it's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ellis County, North Central Texas
</P>
<P>
   WAXAHACHIE _ Across Ellis County, only the best farmers have
survived until now _ primarily 125 full-time operators earning
livelihoods from crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gary Stanford, Ellis County agent for the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service, sees it. Now, he says, their debt
loads are rising beyond their control and their banks' tight
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of this elite population, we're probably going to lose a
third of them out of agriculture,'' Stanford predicted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wilson, 49, is one farmer who is wondering whether he can be
back in the business next year _ or whether he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen cotton die from no water,'' he remarked
recently. ``This year, some of it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who grew up on a farm near Waxahachie that's been in his
family for more than 100 years, returned to the farm in 1976 after
college, military service and eight years with Texas Instruments in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He was just in time for the 1978 drought and interest rates
topping 15 percent on operating loans. Then came 1980's dry heat
wave, slashing his cotton yield by 25 percent, but he survived the
1982-86 farm recession.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, he was enjoying mostly good times before a
1991 flood and persistent rain delayed his harvest for months,
inflicting severe crop losses. After some federal aid and a
rebound, the 1996 drought brought more losses.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wilson's 744 acres of corn produced 12 to 34 bushels
an acre, down from annual averages of 75 to 80 bushels in decent
weather. His 610 acres of cotton might yield half of the farm's
400-pound average.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot was the 120 acres of winter wheat. Its high
yields came in ahead of the drought. They baled much of it for hay,
a wise move because half of the state's hay crop has been
devastated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're in hock,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley and Ann Praslicka, farmers near Waxahachie since 1955,
are another farm family that has weathered the drought. Through the
years, the couple, who reared five children, have minimized their
risk by farming a small acreage they own for cotton, corn and
grain.
</P>
<P>
   They farm 200 dryland acres, and they say their venture will
survive despite a loss of nearly $30,000. They were helped by
insurance payments on a 100 percent corn loss, said Stanley
Praslicka, 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it,'' he said. ``It'll be hard,'' noting that late
rains could further damage his cotton with stains that hurt fiber
quality before harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, the Praslickas rented an additional 100 acres
for three years. Ann Praslicka said they could see no added rewards
from the 300-acre venture, while adding more costs, risks, worries
and labor. So they fell back to their 200 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do all the labor ourselves,'' Stanley Praslicka said,
adding that the farm has provided them with a modest living while
allowing them to set aside college funds for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The family's cotton yields this year, at maybe 200 to 240 pounds
an acre, are among the county's best, despite being down from about
600 pounds an acre in decent weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just hadn't done anything this year and kept our money
in the bank, we'd be better off,'' Ann Praslicka said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Gaines and Dawson counties, Northwest Texas
</P>
<P>
   SEMINOLE and DENVER CITY _ Here among the bumper crop of
oilfield pumpjacks, Anderson Upton has been in a tight water race.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to grow profitable yields of cotton, peanuts and
grain sorghum, but has been losing to rainless, windy days and
temperatures of between 100 and 108 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, Upton jockeyed his pickup from well to well _ 26
in all _ to keep the water pressure high enough to supply 14
irrigation systems serving about 1,600 leased and owned acres.
Peanuts get top priority for water because they have the potential
to produce the best revenue and profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of water,'' said Upton, 37, who must
constantly watch his irrigation systems to ensure they're not
pumping air, leaking or breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   Like others across his region, he has been working virtually
nonstop, logging 14-hour workdays and longer since early May. The
irrigation, though, has been around-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to get the best I can; otherwise, I lose more,''
Upton said. He abandoned watering two 120-acre fields of sorghum
about 45 days ago to have more water for his peanuts and cotton.
Now the sorghum looks like a loss. He also cut his watering time on
some cotton to boost the water flow to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Upton estimates cotton and peanut yields are declining by 20
percent to 50 percent in some spots. Yet the farmwide averages are
likely to be too high to draw on his crop insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In July, his irrigation electricity and gas costs alone tripled
to about $18,000 for the month, from $6,000 a month the previous
year. Unfortunately, he doesn't share royalties from any of the oil
and gas pumpers to offset his rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   While his banker was telling him to curb expenses, he delayed
laying off one of his two hired workers for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not to blame for this weather, and they've got
families to feed, too,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's projecting his seven-year-old farming operation
will lose about $60,000 this year, meaning he'll carry operating
debt into next year. He'll probably have to tie up his 40 percent
equity in a 320-acre tract to get refinancing to operate next year
</P>
<P>
   For now, he mostly keeps his worries to himself, said Anderson's
wife, Tamara Upton, a Seminole schoolteacher. They have 2- and
8-year-old sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe once or twice a month is the only time we sit down at
the table together for a meal,'' she said, citing his long
workdays.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Lower Rio Grande Valley
</P>
<P>
   WESLACO, RIO HONDO and McALLEN _ Lower Rio Grande Valley farmers
were staring into a water-shortage nightmare going into August.
</P>
<P>
   They feared their 27 water districts _ seven of which were
already denying water to farmers and reserving it for the urban
centers' needs _ would be forced to shut off irrigation water for
months or years. The Rio Grande is their tap.
</P>
<P>
   With the drought, Mexican competition, urban sprawl and other
contributing factors, acreage planted in vegetables across the
four-county valley plunged about 50 percent during the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Between 25 percent and 30 percent of the acreage in grapefruit
and orange groves and sugar cane went without irrigation from four
to 10 weeks this summer, when the crops needed water the most. Some
cotton and grain also didn't get enough irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Grande water-rights holders not using their supplies found a
seller's market. Water, which sold for $10 to $15 per acre foot in
the early '90s, reached a peak of $75 to more than $100 per acre
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while missing the Lower Valley, Tropical Storm Charley
struck at points up the Rio Grande. Its runoff rushed into the
river's Amistad and Falcon reservoirs, which supply down-river
irrigation and urban water needs in the Lower Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is not dead,'' said Darrell Duda, general manager
of Duda Texas and its Duda Valley Onions division, a McAllen-based
fresh produce company.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the drought already looming over the Rio Grande watershed
three years ago, Duda Texas cut its planted vegetable acreage by
about 50 percent. Instead of 3,000 irrigated acres of vegetables,
sugar cane and grain crops, Duda Texas cut back to 1,500 irrigated
acres of vegetables and sugar cane _ plus dryland grain on parts of
the other 1,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gotta manage that risk factor,'' said Duda, 36, a
fourth-generation family management-team member for A. Duda &AMP; Sons,
the Oviedo, Fla.-based parent.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Lower Valley, meanwhile, farm debts are running high
due to a string of disasters that have hit cotton, corn, sorghum,
vegetable, citrus and sugar cane growers since 1989, said Jason
Johnson, the Lower Valley's extension economist in Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now even the big farms are losing money,'' Johnson said,
predicting a further consolidation into fewer and larger farms. He
expects a significant reduction of land being farmed.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Wagner Jr., who farms northwest of McAllen, figures his
out-of-pocket cash losses on his drought-wrecked corn crop this
year, after insurance, will exceed $40,000. And that conservative
forecast may just be wishful thinking, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may consider us, especially dryland farmers, to be taking
a big risk, and it's a big gamble,'' he said. ``Yes it is, but what
is not a gamble in our life? ... It just takes timely rains.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Mack Simpson, a farmer in Rio Hondo in the eastern Lower
Valley, figures cotton and grain losses at about $300,000 this year
on the 4,600 leased and 400 owned acres that he farms with his dad,
B.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the final tab, which could be lowered significantly
by beef cattle sales this fall and the final crop insurance
proceeds. The family also ranches about 1,200 cows on nearly 45,000
leased and about 100 owned acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do depends on Mother Nature, the Good Lord up
there,'' said Billie Mack Simpson, 44, whose sugar cane is dying on
630 acres denied irrigation water since late June. ``I'm in limbo
every day of my life.''

PILOT COULD HAVE DUMPED FUEL OVER LAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- The pilot of Swissair 111 chose not to
dump fuel over land in Nova Scotia, permitted under Canadian
regulations, but instead made a 180-degree turn to head back to sea
in the precious final moments of the doomed flight.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded excerpts of communication between the pilots and
air-traffic controllers showed Tuesday that the Swissair crew was
considering a fuel dump over land on its emergency approach to
Halifax International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, however, chose to reverse course only 25 miles from
the airport, in an effort to lighten their load. The aircraft never
returned, crashing violently into the Atlantic with the loss of 229
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to head back to sea was made more than 7 minutes
after the crew first alerted air-traffic controllers that they had
smoke in the cockpit, and less than 3 minutes before electrical
problems forced the crew to fly the plane manually.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian flight regulations allow fuel to be dumped at altitudes
above 2,000 feet. The MD-11 aircraft was higher than 10,000 feet
when it turned back toward the Atlantic with 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, chief investigator of the crash, declined Tuesday to
speculate why the pilot did not choose to dump his fuel over land
on its approach to the Halifax airport. But Joachim Maitre, a
Boston University professor of journalism and international
relations who trained as an East German military pilot, assailed
the pilot's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fly an aircraft from 33,000 feet to the runway in a
very quick time,'' said Maitre, who has written extensively on
defense technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Maitre said, the pilot may not have realized that the
aircraft was equipped with Kapton, an electrical insulator that had
been banned by the US Air Force after a series of F-16 crashes and
later by the US Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material has the quality of magnesium,'' Maitre said. ``It
burns quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kapton had been stripped from the US military aircraft
because of reported burning when subjected to chafing and friction.
Officials for Boeing, which bought MD-11 manufacturer
McDonnell-Douglas last year, confirmed this week that the aircraft
was equipped with the material.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Maitre said, apparently misinterpreted the cause of
the cockpit smoke, which forced the crew to don oxygen masks. ``His
mind was focused on something non-lethal,'' Maitre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew as a pilot that I had this material, I would not
have wasted time attempting to dump fuel,'' Maitre said.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials in the United States and Canada, however,
have said that landing at 30 tons over the maximum weight -- which
Swissair 111 carried -- could have caused the aircraft to barrel
off the runway or erupt in fire from a hard impact.
</P>
<P>
   However, flames may have begun to plague the plane during
flight. Gerden said Tuesday that retrieved pieces of cockpit
wreckage show signs of ``heat stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of smoky conditions, at least, are reinforced by
the expanded excerpts released Tuesday. In them, one crew member
asks the other if he is proceeding through the ``emergency
checklist for air-conditioning smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, overheard because the pilots had not disconnected
their radio link with controllers, was one stage of
trouble-shooting to pinpoint the problem, said Jim Harris of the
Canadian Transportation Safety Board. The question does not mean
that the air-conditioning system was smoking, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the revelation of ``heat stress'' in the cockpit,
Gerden said that the flight-data recorder has shown ``anomalies''
in the aircraft's operating systems. He declined to specify what
systems were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said it was unknown if the problems occurred late in the
flight or even extended back to engine startup for the scheduled
New York-to-Geneva trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said he believes that information retrieved from the
flight-data recorder, which lost power during the flight's final 6
minutes, will be more helpful in determining the cause of the crash
than what occurred in the last stages.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of power to the flight-data recorder also ``does not
necessarily indicate that the aircraft had total electrical
failure,'' Gerden said. The plane had three sources of electricity,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are hopeful that the cockpit voice recorder, which
may be retrieved today, continued to tape the pilots during the
final six minutes when ground controllers lost radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that recorder, military divers are expected to retrieve
more bodies from the ocean Wednesday. Rough weather Tuesday
restricted diving to relatively shallow waters closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   US military assistance has begun to arrive. Newly developed
underwater sensors, which can provide detailed maps of the bottom,
have been loaned for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the salvage ship USS Grapple is expected in Halifax
today, where it will refuel and put to sea Friday for use off
Peggy's Cove. The ship, used in the investigation of the TWA Flight
800 crash two years ago, can lift 300-ton objects.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 33 US military divers -- whose experience includes
the TWA crash, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, and a
Haitian ferry sinking -- will help provide relief for the 75
Canadian divers who have labored on the scene since Thursday.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices continued their wild ride Tuesday, but
the vertiginous swings left investors cheering, as the Dow Jones
industrial average vaulted 380.53 points, or just under 5 percent.
Broader market averages also recorded hefty gains, partly reversing
their recent steep declines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to explain the big jump in equity prices, market
analysts and traders said that comments last Friday by Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave investors
hope that a coordinated response might be forthcoming from the Fed
and other central banks to crises in Asian and Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   They said investors were encouraged by Monday's vigorous rally
in foreign stock markets, an advance that continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's rise in percentage terms was the biggest percentage
gain since the crash of 1987 but well below the record 15.34
percent rise of March 15, 1933, when the average climbed 8.26
points, to 62.10.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 1987, it gained 10.15 percent, or 186.84 points, to
2,027.85
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's surge was the biggest point gain ever. Still, the
close, at 8,020.78, was 14 percent below the record of 9,337.97 set
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' said the fact that most stocks were trading at deep
discounts to their 52-week highs _ 44 percent on average _ was
another factor in Tuesday's climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were oversold,'' said Charles Clough, chief
investment strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``And I don't think it
takes much of a change in psychology to spark something of a
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech delivered at the University of California at
Berkeley last Friday, Greenspan suggested the Fed was less
concerned than previously about an inflationary threat, and might
be prepared to lower interest rates if sagging overseas economies
threatened domestic economic growth. Later, a dinner meeting the
Fed chairman attended with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Japanese Finance Minister Keichi Miyazawa led to speculation that,
after months of jawboning by U.S. officials, Japan might be about
to implement policies to reform its banking systems and to reflate
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clough and others said they did not view the mere
prospect of action by the United States and other industrialized
nations, most importantly Japan, as sufficient to send stock prices
soaring again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't over yet,'' said Byron Wien, U.S. investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, referring to the market's
recent unsettled state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the start of another bull leg,'' he continued.
``First of all, none of the structural problems that caused people
to rethink things last month have been overcome. The typical action
in a down market is for stocks to get deeply oversold, to rally,
and then to retest the lows.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few analysts expected gains as broad or as sharp as were
made Tuesday. Four stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. In addition to the Dow, the broader
market averages also soared.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index jumped 49.57 points, or just
over 5 percent, to 1,023.46. The Nasdaq composite index registered
its biggest point gain ever, soaring 94.34 points, or more than 6
percent, to 1,660.86; that was its second largest in percentage
terms, behind the 7.34 percent advance recorded on Oct. 21, 1987.
And the Russell 2000 index, made up of mostly small and
medium-sized stocks, increased by 14.86 points, or 4.28 percent, to
361.93.
</P>
<P>
   Big institutions like pension funds, which typically trade in
big blocks of 10,000 or more shares, did a preponderantly large
amount of the buying Tuesday, in contrast to their recent tendency
to be heavy net sellers of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Near the close of trading, just under $700 million worth of
stock was purchased in lots of less than 10,000 shares, according
to Laszlo Birinyi, whose firm, Birinyi &AMP; Associates, tracks market
developments. Individual or retail traders seldom buy or sell as
many as 10,000 shares at a time. By comparison, more than $2.2
billion worth of stock was bought big blocks, Birinyi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference today is that the professionals were coming
back,'' into stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a second day buying was heavy on a number of foreign
markets, especially in Asi. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index was up
just under 1 percent, after surging 5 percent Monday. Hong Kong's
Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent, following Monday's 7.1 percent
surge. In Europe, Germany's DAX index rose 3.7 percent, and the
Paris CAC-40 rose 2.9 percent. But London's FT-SE 100 slipped 0.1
percent after strong gains Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, all 30 Dow industrial stocks rose.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, which along with most other financial stocks
has been battered recently, climbed $6.38 a share, to $80. General
Electric gained $6.25, to 81.88, after its engine unit said it
expected sales this year to rise 42 percent, to $10 billion. And
McDonald's shares jumped $6.31, to $64.44.
</P>
<P>
   The day's gain in the Dow surpassed the record 337-point advance
set last Oct. 28. Volume on the Big Board was the tenth-heaviest
ever, at 810.6 million shares. Nine of the exchange's 10 busiest
days have come in the last month, and four of those have happened
since the beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volatility in the market shows nervousness and anxiety on
the part of institutional investors,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief
investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``while time
and again individual investors have shown more restraint and more
of a longer-term horizon than many professionals give them credit
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Clough, the Merrill Lynch strategist, said Americans had not
significantly changed the amount of money they were putting into
401-k retirement plans and equity mutual funds. ``What has changed
are foreign inflows,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and third quarter of last year, he said,
foreigners were putting $100 billion into American equities at an
annual rate, about four times as high as previously. In the first
quarter of 1998, that number accelerated to $125 billion, he said.
``These are massive, manic liquidity flows,'' he added.

MICROSOFT ASKS COURT TO DISMISS ANTITRUST SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-SUN) 
(bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a long, derisive court brief, Microsoft Corp.
asked a federal judge Tuesday to dismiss the government's antitrust
suit, arguing that the Justice Department and 20 states were trying
to ``distract the court from the fatal defects in their claims by
slinging as much mud as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was answering a Justice Department brief filed last
week that detailed new evidence accusing Microsoft of trying to
tyrannize several competing companies, including Intel Corp., Apple
Computer Inc. and Intuit Corp., maker of the Quicken accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia, Microsoft made little effort to dispute
the new charges, saying they were ``irrelevant facts given in a
desperate attempt to cloud the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Microsoft's lawyers, pursuing a strategy first laid out
in a court hearing last week, offered counter arguments only to the
specific charges and statements spelled out in the original lawsuit
filed last May. Any other evidence uncovered since then does not
belong in the case, the company argued. And if the trial judge,
Thomas Penfield Jackson, disagrees _ as he has already suggested he
might _ Microsoft lawyers say the company will ask him to delay the
trial for six months.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's brief is a final effort to persuade the judge to
dismiss the case. ``We believe the case should be dismissed now,
without a long and costly trial,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president for law and corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismissed the government's presentation of new
evidence without discussing the original charges as ``revealing a
profound lack of confidence in the case they filed in May.''
Microsoft also said that the new accusations were unfounded and
that some ``are nothing but a smear tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the brief included refutations of the core charges
in the original suit, particularly the allegation that Microsoft
was illegally bundling Internet Explorer, the browser used to
navigate the World Wide Web, with the Windows operating system.
Bundling the two, the government has argued, was an attempt to
cripple Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the principle
competing Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long argued that the browser, Internet Explorer,
and Windows, are one product, impossible to separate. Central to
the Microsoft argument is a letter from Netscape lawyers to
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the letter would prove that ``Netscape itself has
already conceded that it is impossible to remove Internet Explorer
technologies from Windows 98 without causing serious damage to the
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it was made public Tuesday, the letter had been part of
confidential court filings.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape letter said: ``We are totally unable to provide
examples of files that can or cannot be deleted from Windows 98
since, as we discussed this week, it is our understanding that it
simply is not possible to delete any portion of Internet Explorer,
or of browsing functionality, from Windows 98 as presently
configured without severely interfering with the operating
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers disagreed with that assessment. ``The
Microsoft statement is nothing new,'' the Justice Department said
in a statement Tuesday. ``We look forward to proving in the
upcoming trial that Microsoft has engaged in a series of
anti-competitive acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the government's antitrust suit charges
Microsoft with forcing Internet service companies to support
Internet Explorer, not Netscape, in exchange for receiving
promotional space on a part of the main Windows screen known as the
Channel Bar.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Microsoft does not dispute that it followed such a
policy but added that it voluntarily suspended the policy for some
of the companies last winter. Furthermore, it contended that the
government must prove that someone was harmed by the policy for it
to be a supportable charge, and that has not been done.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Microsoft said, the remaining agreements ``expire on
September 30, 1998, and Microsoft has informed'' the relevant
companies ``that Microsoft will not be renewing any of those
agreements because the Channel Bar concept has not been
sufficiently popular with consumers and is thus being
discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely,'' the brief added, ``there are more productive uses of
this Court's resources than holding a trial to rule on the legality
of waived provisions in contracts that are about to expire and that
will not be renewed _ especially when those provisions were not
anticompetitive in the first place.''

CLINTON SENDS TOP AIDE TO ASSESS NORTHWEST STRIKE DEADLOCK  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton dispatched one of his closest aides
to Minneapolis on Tuesday to try to break the deadlock between
Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots, which has grounded the
carrier for 11 days and disrupted travel in the much of the Midwest
and South.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel and one of
Clinton's most trusted lieutenants, flew aboard a government jet to
Minneapolis, where a federal mediator is meeting with the two
sides. He was joined by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The two men did not arrive until late in the day, and it was
unclear precisely what role they would play. A White House
spokesman, Barry Toiv, would say only that the two men planned to
``assess the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Lindsey reflects the increasing political
pressure on Clinton since the pilots walked out on Aug. 29.
Republicans and officials in states hurt by the strike have been
urging the president to use his executive powers to order the
pilots back to work, as he did last year in the case of American
Airlines. But leading Democrats and labor leaders have called just
as loudly for him not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said that Clinton has not ruled out
intervening but that he would prefer to see a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a break for Labor Day, the mediator resumed
meetings with representatives of the union and the airline on
Tuesday in an effort to restart negotiations. Similar discussions
in Chicago over the weekend accomplished little, participants said.
The two sides have not returned to the bargaining table since the
strike began.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is now the longest against an airline since
machinists walked out at Eastern Airlines in 1989. The pilots are
asking for greater job security and a 15 percent raise over three
years. The company has offered them a 9 percent raise over four
years. The average pilot earns $120,000 a year, according to the
union; the company says the average is $133,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise is difficult for both sides because the pilots, who
agreed to wage concessions in 1993 to help save the airline from
bankruptcy, resent that Northwest has resisted their demands after
posting four years of record profits. The company says it cannot
sweeten its offer to the pilots because it is also negotiating
contracts with other unions representing workers who took salary
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The union and many Wall Street analysts say that Northwest's
strategy is to hold out until the president is forced to intervene.
Clinton has the power to order the pilots back to work for 60 days
while an emergency board tries to find a resolution acceptable to
both sides. Northwest has said that it is not advocating
presidential intervention, though it has promoted the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who has served as an aide to Clinton since his early
days in politics, has more clout than anyone previously involved in
the dispute to press both sides to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is somebody who I think both sides can talk to and know
that they are talking to a direct emissary of the president,'' Toiv
said.
</P>
<P>
   But by becoming more directly involved, he can also better
advise the president as to whether he needs to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Slater has already exerted some pressure on Northwest by
ordering two commuter affiliates who halted operations during the
strike to resume flights to 17 communities.

RENO ORDERS 90-DAY INQUIRY INTO WHETHER CAMPAIGN ADS ILLEGALY AIDED
CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: 2nd-take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET.) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advancing a pivotal step toward the possible
appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate campaign
finance abuses, Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday ordered a
90-day inquiry into whether President Clinton circumvented federal
election laws in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision marked the third time in less than two weeks
that the Justice Department has begun a 90-day independent-counsel
inquiry into allegations of possible election improprieties _ this
one into whether Clinton illegally benefited from Democratic
advertisements during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other two investigations, this one named Clinton
himself as the subject of an inquiry, and is potentially the most
far-reaching because it goes to the heart of the Democrats
fund-raising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the three-judge panel that supervises
independent counsel matters, Reno said she had commenced a
preliminary investigation ``involving President of the United
States William Jefferson Clinton concerning political
advertisements during the 1996 election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The new inquiry centers on whether Clinton and White House aides
coordinated Democratic issue ads in an improper effort to violate
federal spending limits he agreed to when he accepted taxpayer
financing of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other two outstanding inquiries focus on Vice President Al
Gore's statements about his telephone fund-raising calls and on
possible perjury by Harold Ickes, a former deputy White House chief
of staff, concerning his dealings with the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue ad investigation, Reno initiated the 90-day review
based on the preliminary findings of an Federal Election Commission
audit last month. The audit concluded the Democratic National
Committee evaded federal spending limits by funneling millions of
dollars to state parties for ads that were thinly veiled messages
on behalf of the Clinton-Gore campaign. The ads, the audit
determined, should have been paid for by the campaign rather than
by the party.

 &HT;    Republican warns against focus on Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans could undermine their chances for large
gains in the November elections if they focus on President
Clinton's problems, Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the campaign into a national referendum on Clinton
needlessly risks creating the perception that Republicans are
piling on, said Linder, chairman of House Republicans' campaign
committee, in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the character issue could pop up in the final days
of the fall campaign in Republican ads urging voters to continue
GOP leadership of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we close with some kind of
commercial that said, `Who's going to keep an eye on him if we have
a Democratic Congress?''' Linder said in a later interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican said opinion polls that show an erosion
of trust in Clinton also indicate that voters see a GOP Congress as
a bulwark against the president.
</P>
<P>
   A new bipartisan poll released Tuesday shows that Clinton's
admittedly inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky is
threatening to cut into Democrats' usual advantage among women and
senior citizens and could dim voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that
Democratic candidates continue to do well in district-by-district
polling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always anticipated that 1998 would be a low-turnout
year,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   But Linder said the Battleground Poll shows that Democrats
``have a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While Linder held fast to his prediction of a Republican gain of
12 to 15 seats in the House, he said Republicans are in a position
to ``catch an October wave, if there is one,'' and possibly gain
more than 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The wave would be the release of damaging details from
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's widely anticipated report to
Congress.

   He briefed reporters on the launch of a second round of issue
advertising that Republicans are running in key congressional

   In both districts, well-financed Democrats are trying to win
seats that are held by Republicans who are running for the U.S.
Senate.

 &HT;    Opinions vary in town that bears president's name
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, N.C. _ Retired state trooper William Pate gets so angry
thinking about President Clinton these days that he wants his rural
Carolina hometown to change it's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want nothing to do with the man,'' said Pate. ``I
think it's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has never set foot in his Carolina namesake _ it
was named for a Revolutionary War hero 180 years ago _ but his sex
scandal and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation stir
up plenty of strong feelings among residents here, with many ready
to forgive and forget and others so upset they say they would run
him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 60 miles south of the state capital of Raleigh and
the hometown of Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), Clinton may not be
Middletown, USA, but residents here sum up the president's travails
in much the same way as the rest of the country outside of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For folks here, Clinton's statements about former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and his relationship with her aren't about
legal semantics _ whether or not what he said was misleading but
``legally accurate.'' It's about sex in high places, telling the
truth and the nation's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Mayor Emsley Kennedy, think Starr has ``wasted the
taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's private life ought to be his private life, whether
it's the president of the United States or the person on the
street,'' Kennedy said. ``By gosh, what's it been _ four or five or
six years now? It's just ridiculous, I think. If they've got some
charges bring them forward and get it over with. Decide what you
are going to do and get on with the country's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Others such Pate get so bothered talking about the president
they loose their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told when I was a youngin' to tell the truth,'' said
Pate. ``He stood up there and looked in a million peoples' faces
and said I did not do it. And then he come back and said I did do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This country would be a lot better with (him) out of there,''
Pate continued, working up a full head of steam. ``If he'll lie
once, he'll lie again. He's never told this country he's sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the town of Clinton was named for Lt. Col.
Richard Clinton, militiaman in the revolutionary war, whose land
now holds the Sampson County courthouse. Albert Kaleel, a member of
the Clinton City Council, said no one has asked to have the town's
name changed since the Clinton scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Kaleel, who's been serving hot dogs and hamburgers from
his lunch counter on the town square since 1932, said he thinks the
president ought to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake,'' said Kaleel between serving customers on
a recent afternoon. ``He'd been better off if he'd owned up to it
to start with, but after all he did own up to it eventually. How
many men wouldn't deny this if their wives were around?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kaleel, his own wife, Jane Kaleel, was around
to hear his final comment and issued a derisive snort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very careless and a liar,'' Mrs. Kaleel said of the
president. ``I would hate for him to be my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   James Colwell, clipping hair at Colwell's Barber Shop just down
the street, was more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a man,'' said Colwell. ``I can't expect no more of
him than I can expect of myself. I don't hold anything against him
_ I've got my own problems to keep straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Shaffer, with the local Farm Bureau, said he expects more
from politicians, especially presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to have leaders who have bad morals,''
said Shaffer, who belongs to the men's religious organization known
as Promise Keepers. ``If he's a government leader he ought to have
a little integrity. I don't think he has any. You are talking about
someone who's supposed to be an example to my family and my
children. I don't think he's setting a very good example.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether supportive or critical of the president, residents here
said the president's problems haven't occasioned nearly the amount
of discussion and debate as they have in Washington, where Congress
is paralyzed in anticipation of Starr's report and pundits can talk
of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Warren, owner of Just Nailz, said her customers don't talk
about the president that much, or if they do, it's ``comments like,
'They should leave him alone, let him run the country.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal problems are his own business,'' said Warren.
``If his wife can live with him then I can, too. He's not the only
one who has done that. He is probably the only one who has been
exposed. It's just a character trait in high places.''

 &HT;    Delta execs to attend funeral for victims of Swissair crash
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The top executive at Delta Air Lines, which booked 53
of the passengers on Swissair Flight 111 and had a flight attendant
aboard the plane, will attend memorial services for the victims
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mullin, president and chief executive of Atlanta-based
Delta, will travel to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for a service this
evening and then to New York for another memorial Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin's presence reflects Delta's quiet but considerable
involvement in the aftermath of the Sept. 2 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the crash, Delta employees notified most of
the relatives of the 131 American passengers _ not just those it
had booked. The toll-free information number published by Swissair
actually was answered by Delta employees in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was logical for us to do that because Swissair is not
heavily staffed in the U.S., and we had more people ready to
respond quickly,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also assigned specially trained employees to the families
of American victims. The employees help with travel arrangements,
coordinate with other relatives, answer questions and try to
provide solace. The relationship can last for months.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has a team in Halifax to provide family support services
and assist Swissair officials and investigators. Delta is keenly
interested in what caused the Swissair MD-11 to crash because it
also flies the three-engine jet.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, investigators said there are signs of heating on some
small pieces of wreckage from the cockpit area, which could help
them determine the source of smoke reported by pilots before the
jet plunged into the ocean near Halifax. They declined to speculate
on the cause of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather halted attempts to salvage the plane's cockpit voice
recorder, still on the sea bottom. Work is expected to resume
today. The MD-11's flight data recorder has been recovered but
contains no data from the last six minutes of flight, fueling
speculation about an electrical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Swissair are longtime marketing partners and routinely
book passengers on each others' trans-Atlantic flights. Walter
Vollenweider, Swissair's vice president for North America, said the
marketing pact outlines post-accident cooperation. But he added,
``What Delta has done goes far beyond what was spelled out, no
questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said that, had the airlines' roles been reversed, Delta
would have sought similar assistance from Swissair.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-Geneva flight that crashed was among the most
popular of the two airlines' jointly booked flights. Patricia
Eberhart, a New York-based Delta flight attendant, was working
Flight 111 under a cross-utilization program. Eberhart, 51, was a
30-year veteran who previously worked for Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Swissair has been lauded for the attention paid to
the needs of grieving families. It's provided charter flights,
chauffeured minivans and police protection to ensure privacy. The
airline has offered families a $20,000 payment for immediate needs,
and its executives have been visible.
</P>
<P>
   That response is in contrast to TWA's seemingly aloof stance
after the Flight 800 disaster in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Delta's involvement could include defending
itself against legal claims. Berry said Swissair has primary
liability, but lawyers say that probably won't shield Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they acted as an agent and referred people to a defective
aircraft they will be open to claims,'' predicted Atlanta liability
lawyer Guerry Thornton.

 &HT;    Q and A with Charles Mosely, Jr.
 &HT;    By Michael Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Moseley Jr. is general partner in Noro-Moseley
Partners, metro Atlanta's largest venture capital company.
Noro-Moseley earlier this year put together its fourth venture
capital fund. That money will be invested in a number of small
high-tech companies in exchange for partial ownership. Should the
companies prosper, Noro-Moseley investors will also gain as their
investments reap large returns when the company's interests are
sold. Of course, companies can fail, too. Moseley spoke with the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the pearls and perils of venture
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has Atlanta's technology sector changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have been in business for 15 years. The activity we see
today vs. that of 15 years ago is just substantially different. The
long-anticipated Silicon Valley of the South that the Chamber of
Commerce has been promoting for years _ it really is finally here.
Oh, it's not on the scale of California, but compared to the rest
of the country, it is really happening. Two places really stand
out. Research Triangle Park and metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What caused the change?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not any one thing. Things just take time to develop.
There's Scientific-Atlanta since the 1950s. There have been
national companies that have moved operations here. There is a
growing infrastructure that has produced entrepreneurs who were
young people in those companies. Also, many if not most of the
companies that we see here have some connection to Georgia Tech.
And the stock market boom really helped. The kind of wealth that
has been created as encouragement to people to go try their hand at
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where are Noro-Moseley's investments?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have seven or eight investments in Research Triangle out
of about 25 during our most recent fund (started earlier this
year). Then there is one in Tennessee, and I think the rest are in
Atlanta. About 85 percent of our investments overall have been in
the Southeast. What's new is our involvement in Research Triangle
Park, but that has not come at the expense of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between now and then?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the opportunities are much better. There are more of
them and they are better quality. The Internet didn't exist then.
... It's a dramatic development that will change the way people do
business and communicate. There's a lot of medical-related stuff,
much of it coming out of Emory. And in Atlanta we are seeing
better, more experienced management teams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many proposals do you get, entrepreneurs asking for
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: On average, we probably get 10 or so a week of what I'd call
serious proposals. That means 500 to 700 in a year. Maybe 100 to
200 are really serious proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After you've studied them and their business plans, looked at
their potential market and made up your minds, how many are going
to end up with your money?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have made seven investments in the past six months. We'll
make 10 to 15 deals in a year. We have done some early stage
investing. But typically, the company we invest in already has some
revenue and they are looking to expand. And we've done some
late-round investing too. The average investment time in a company
is five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the average size of an investment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our average size has gone up because our fund has gotten
larger. The average in the future will be close to $3 million a
deal. We generally have been the lead investor, but not the only
investor. The max, at any one time, will probably be 20 to 25
investments, and we have six people. We spend a lot of time with
the companies. But we are not in the business of managing
companies. We are in the business of managing investments. What we
try to do is make sure we have the best team possible in those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much of a gamble is it? How often do things turn out the
way you expect and you make a great return?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the time, things take longer than you expected.
Things probably take more money than you expected to spend, too.
Twenty percent of our investments turn out to be losers, and 80
percent range from mediocre to very good. It's not as risky as you
would think. But most of the time it's not great or nothing _ there
is a lot in-between. ... Our effort is to maximize the return of
our investors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you consider a good return?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fact is we never really know what's going to happen. It
lies in the future. The reality is these entrepreneurs don't know
either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What you do is really different from how others make money...
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we all get some satisfaction from building things. We
don't make money by cutting things up and closing things down. The
last 10 or 15 years has really been the golden age of
entrepreneurs, and we are part of that. It is about growing things,
and it is hard work. Entrepreneurs have taken the path less
traveled and it's not easy to do.

MERRILL LYNCH'S OVERSEAS LOSS IS $135 MILLION  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said on Tuesday that it lost $135
million in July and August from its business with Russia and other
emerging markets, and is now preparing to cut costs after the
recent turmoil in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The losses are expected to reduce the brokerage firm's net
income for July and August to an estimated $102 million, according
to Merrill, which made its announcement after the stock market
closed. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 1997, Merrill earned
$493 million.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has never before made such an interim announcement of
its earnings, David H. Komansky, its chairman and chief executive
said in an interview on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of other big American and European financial
companies, including Citicorp, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. and the Bankers Trust Corp., have announced hundreds
of millions of dollars of losses in the last two weeks after Russia
effectively defaulted on some debt, sending prices tumbling for the
securities of developing nations and causing interest margins to
widen rapidly for less creditworthy borrowers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden reversal of fortune for financial services companies,
some of the most successful companies of recent years, has been
stunning. ``It's impressive that so many big and smart institutions
were on the wrong side of this trade,'' said John Keefe, president
of Keefe Worldwide, a financial services consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Merrill have said often in the last couple of
weeks that their company did not report financial results
``intra-quarter,'' implying that it would wait until it announced
its results for the three months ended Sept. 30 before revealing
its losses from Russia and other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said on Tuesday that it was making an exception to this
policy ``because of the intensive public focus on deteriorating
conditions in the emerging markets, and the fact that most major
international financial institutions have made some form of
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said that the emerging markets' losses it announced on
Tuesday included the cost of marking down its inventories of
securities to market value, allowances for its own exposure to
third parties with losses in emerging markets, and losses from its
own trading. Merrill said that its cash earnings in July and August
_ excluding the effect of goodwill, most of it from its recent
$5.3-billion acquisition of Mercury Asset Management, the British
money manager _ totaled $138 million.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's top executives declined to specify what expenses, or
how much, they might seek to cut. ``We're reviewing our
alternatives now,'' said Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief
executive officer. ``Discretionary spending, what can be
eliminated, what can be deferred. We have a wide range of
alternatives. How quickly to expand. We are in the midst of
evaluating all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, a managing director and brokerage analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of the Travelers Group, said:
``They clearly had, as they said, $135 million of emerging markets
fixed income trading losses in the quarter. But it's also clear
from their other remarks that in order to get to only $100 million
or so of profits for July and August there must be substantial
additional losses with other credit-oriented bond products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very unusual series of events in the credit
markets,'' Moszkowski added. ``But there will be some questioning
of their credit controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other firms, including Salomon Smith Barney and Bankers
Trust have reported worse losses than Merrill. ``It's obviously not
good news, but considering what some others have reported it could
have been worse,'' Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers
Harriman &AMP; Co., said.

PILOT COULD HAVE DUMPED FUEL OVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- The pilot of Swissair 111 chose not to
dump fuel over land in Nova Scotia, permitted under Canadian
regulations, but instead made a 180-degree turn to head back to sea
in the precious final moments of the doomed flight.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded excerpts of communication between the pilots and
air-traffic controllers showed Tuesday that the Swissair crew was
considering a fuel dump over land on its emergency approach to
Halifax International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, however, chose to reverse course only 25 miles from
the airport, in an effort to lighten their load. The aircraft never
returned, crashing violently into the Atlantic with the loss of 229
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to head back to sea was made more than 7 minutes
after the crew first alerted air-traffic controllers that they had
smoke in the cockpit, and less than 3 minutes before electrical
problems forced the crew to fly the plane manually.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian flight regulations allow fuel to be dumped at altitudes
above 2,000 feet. The MD-11 aircraft was higher than 10,000 feet
when it turned back toward the Atlantic with 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, chief investigator of the crash, declined Tuesday to
speculate why the pilot did not choose to dump his fuel over land
on its approach to the Halifax airport. But Joachim Maitre, a
Boston University professor of journalism and international
relations who trained as an East German military pilot, assailed
the pilot's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fly an aircraft from 33,000 feet to the runway in a
very quick time,'' said Maitre, who has written extensively on
defense technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Maitre said, the pilot may not have realized that the
aircraft was equipped with Kapton, an electrical insulator that had
been banned by the US Air Force after a series of F-16 crashes and
later by the US Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material has the quality of magnesium,'' Maitre said. ``It
burns quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kapton had been stripped from the US military aircraft
because of reported burning when subjected to chafing and friction.
Officials for Boeing, which bought MD-11 manufacturer
McDonnell-Douglas last year, confirmed this week that the aircraft
was equipped with the material.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Maitre said, apparently misinterpreted the cause of
the cockpit smoke, which forced the crew to don oxygen masks. ``His
mind was focused on something non-lethal,'' Maitre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew as a pilot that I had this material, I would not
have wasted time attempting to dump fuel,'' Maitre said.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials in the United States and Canada, however,
have said that landing at 30 tons over the maximum weight -- which
Swissair 111 carried -- could have caused the aircraft to barrel
off the runway or erupt in fire from a hard impact.
</P>
<P>
   However, flames may have begun to plague the plane during
flight. Gerden said Tuesday that retrieved pieces of cockpit
wreckage show signs of ``heat stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of smoky conditions, at least, are reinforced by
the expanded excerpts released Tuesday. In them, one crew member
asks the other if he is proceeding through the ``emergency
checklist for air-conditioning smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, overheard because the pilots had not disconnected
their radio link with controllers, was one stage of
trouble-shooting to pinpoint the problem, said Jim Harris of the
Canadian Transportation Safety Board. The question does not mean
that the air-conditioning system was smoking, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the revelation of ``heat stress'' in the cockpit,
Gerden said that the flight-data recorder has shown ``anomalies''
in the aircraft's operating systems. He declined to specify what
systems were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said it was unknown if the problems occurred late in the
flight or even extended back to engine startup for the scheduled
New York-to-Geneva trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said he believes that information retrieved from the
flight-data recorder, which lost power during the flight's final 6
minutes, will be more helpful in determining the cause of the crash
than what occurred in the last stages.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of power to the flight-data recorder also ``does not
necessarily indicate that the aircraft had total electrical
failure,'' Gerden said. The plane had three sources of electricity,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are hopeful that the cockpit voice recorder, which
may be retrieved today, continued to tape the pilots during the
final six minutes when ground controllers lost radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that recorder, military divers are expected to retrieve
more bodies from the ocean Wednesday. Rough weather Tuesday
restricted diving to relatively shallow waters closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   US military assistance has begun to arrive. Newly developed
underwater sensors, which can provide detailed maps of the bottom,
have been loaned for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the salvage ship USS Grapple is expected in Halifax
today, where it will refuel and put to sea Friday for use off
Peggy's Cove. The ship, used in the investigation of the TWA Flight
800 crash two years ago, can lift 300-ton objects.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 33 US military divers -- whose experience includes
the TWA crash, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, and a
Haitian ferry sinking -- will help provide relief for the 75
Canadian divers who have labored on the scene since Thursday.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Well before Swissair Flight 111 hit the
water last Wednesday night, a computerized black box that tracks
dozens of functions on the big MD-11 recorded system after system
breaking down, the chief investigator said on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   While the box, the flight data recorder, sat near the tail and
silently tracked over 250 different characteristics, up front, in
the smoke-filled cockpit, the two pilots were striving to find
their problem and simultaneously prepare for an unexpected approach
to an unfamiliar airport. A transcript released on Tuesday shows at
least a touch of frantic confusion slipping in. At one point, the
pilots broadcast a conversation between the two of them, in German,
to a puzzled air traffic controller on the ground; and, at another
point, both decided to talk to the controller at once.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still hoping to recover the other black box,
the cockpit voice recorder, but rough weather kept divers out of
the water on Tuesday. But with enough analysis, said the chief
investigator, Vic Gerden, of Canada's Transportation Safety Board,
the details from the box that Canadian navy divers brought up on
Sunday may reveal where the plane's problem began, even if the box
quit six minutes before the plane crashed five miles off the coast
near here. But Gerden said that investigators in his
data-processing laboratory in Ottawa were working backwards from
the end of the data and had not yet determined where, on the
25-hour record (a period that could cover three previous flights)
the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Gerden confirmed that fire-damaged parts that
were collected along the shoreline here are from the airplane; in
fact, they are ``heat-damaged'' parts from the cockpit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a transcript released by the board of the last 27 minutes
of communication between the Geneva-bound jet and air traffic
controllers shows some confusion on both sides of the conversation,
it was not immediately evident if the errors made any difference to
the outcome of the flight. All 229 people on the plane were killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The portion of the air traffic control communications released
on Tuesday begins with the plane, about half an hour out of Kennedy
International Airport in New York, using standard language to
introduce itself to a controller at a high-altitude control center
in Moncton, New Brunswick, as ``Swissair one-eleven heavy.'' Heavy
means any plane over 300,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The plane reports in at 58 minutes after midnight, Greenwich
mean time, or just before 10 p.m. here, and just before 9 p.m. in
New York. All proceeds normally until a pilot says the flight is
``declaring Pan Pan Pan,'' the call sign for an urgent problem, 16
minutes later. The pilot _ no one knows yet if it was the captain
or the first officer _ says he wants to go to ``a convenient place,
I guess Boston.'' Controllers limit each altitude to planes going
in a single direction, and the controller clears the Swissair
flight to descend from 33,000 feet to 31,000, an altitude
appropriate for traffic headed to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty seconds after Swissair's initial call, the controller,
with a much better idea of the MD-11's location, says, ``uh, would
you prefer to go into Halifax,'' which is about as close to an
order as an air traffic controller gives a plane in trouble; thirty
seconds later, Swissair accepts the suggestion. ``Speedbird,'' a
call sign for a supersonic Concorde, is listening in, and the
British Air crew supplies Swissair with weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid what is undoubtedly a very heavy workload in the cockpit,
the Swissair pilot has to ask twice for the wind direction and the
radio frequency for the instrument landing system at Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   An open question for investigators _ and armchair accident
analysts _ is whether the plane could have begun dumping fuel
earlier, to get the plane's weight down to the manufacturer's
recommended maximum for landing, or should have bothered dumping at
all, if it delayed a landing. In Canada, Gerden said on Tuesday
evening, planes may dump fuel if they are above 2,000 feet above
ground level, and the plane need not have circled the water to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilot asks, at 1:21:30, ``we, uh, must dump some fuel.
May we do that in this area during descent?'' the controller does
not immediately answer, but asks if the plane can turn left or
right for a previously-discussed circle to lose altitude. The pilot
says, ``we are able for a left or right turn towards the south to
dump,'' a course that will take them out to sea. The controller
tells them they will be over the coast in 10 miles, and that they
should advise him when they are ready to dump. The pilot does not
say he is beginning dumping until 1:24:56, almost three minutes
later, at which time the controller tells him, `just a couple of
miles I'll be right with you,'' and thirty seconds after that, the
controller tells the crew to begin dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling moment is when (at 1:22:36) a pilot has
evidently keyed the microphone for transmission to the ground while
discussing with the other pilot, in German, whether they are
performing the emergency checklist for smoke, a confusion
equivalent to trying to carry on two telephone conversations
simultaneously and putting the wrong one on hold.

STARR SAID TO REFUSE CLINTON AN EARLY LOOK AT REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Tuesday
rejected a White House request for an advance look at his report of
possible impeachable offenses by President Clinton before sending
it to the House of Representatives, setting the stage for a
possible showdown over the report's contents.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report is expected to reach the House ``this week or
next,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday. Lott
suggested the written request from Clinton's private attorney,
David Kendall, to preview the report was a stalling tactic. ``I
wouldn't be surprised if they go to court to try to block it,''
Lott said about administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over Starr's report comes as Clinton, worried
that Democrats are beginning to openly criticize his admission of
an affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, plans
to meet Wednesday morning with House Democratic leaders, who will
have a lot to say about how the report is handled.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, according to White House officials and Democratic
strategists, is designed to persuade congressional leaders to
support the president at a time some Democrats are publically
signaling their disapproval of Clinton. Adding to his problems is
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision Tuesday to order a 90-day
preliminary investigation of funding for the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign ads, a review that could lead to another independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the president needs to repair his relationship with
Congress,to the extent that he can,'' a Democratic strategist close
to the White House said. ``There are obviously a lot of distraught,
angry and upset people. They are going to be deciding his fate, so
he has a particular interest in calming their distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall on Monday had asked Starr to allow him and Clinton's
White House lawyers a week to review the independent counsel's
report and provide a response before sending it to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides and advisers said the request was fair, since
Kendall was not allowed to cross-examine grand jury witnessess,
including Lewinsky. The aides also view Starr as being under no
obligation to include exculpatory information about Clinton in his
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make this request to ensure that this first step in the
most serious process contemplated by our Constitution is taken with
due consideration for fundamental fairness,'' Kendall wrote to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in his response to Kendall, said, ``As a matter of legal
interpretation, I respectfully disagree with your analysis. My
conclusion is that you are mistaken in your views ... and right to
review a `report' before it is transmitted to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr concluded, ``If you believe it is appropriate for your
client to be allowed to review that information ... before that
information is made public, I suggest that you address your
concerns to the House of Representatives where such a decision
might be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr refused to confirm that his office is preparing a
report, his four-page letter detailed his legal right to provide
Congress with information and analysis that may constitute grounds
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also noted Clinton refused several invitations to testify
before the grand jury. On April 3, after the sixth refusal, Starr
wrote to Kendall: ``If the President chooses again not give his
testimony, so that the grand jury may at least receive some of his
evidence, please provide this Office with any and all exculpatory
evidence you may have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall is still expected to submit a simultaneous report to
Congress that interprets the evidence against Clinton in a more
favorable light than the White house expects from Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with the White House's strategy said Kendall
probably not pursue a court fight to review the report because that
might appear the president has something to hide. More likely, said
another source, the White House would use Starr's rejection to
galvanize the president's supporters to criticize the fairness of
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Reich, former labor secretary under Clinton and now
professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University,
said, ``The White House will obviously do whatever it can to
confirm the public's deep suspicion that Ken Starr is playing
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can make the issue Ken Starr, as they almost succeeded
in doing before the president was pushed into a corner two weeks
ago at the time of his grand jury apperance, they can succeed in
deflecting attention off the issue of presidential judgment and
veracity,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is scrambling to develop a legal and political
strategy for handling the fallout from the president's
acknowledgement on Aug. 17 of an inappropriate relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After that admission, Clinton left for a two-week vacation on
Martha's Vineyard and a weeklong visit to Russia and Ireland. He
returned Sunday to a more hostile political atmosphere that
included members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   During his first full day back at work in Washington in three
weeks, Clinton visited a Maryland school Tuesday, made significant
because Democratic Governor Parris Glendening snubbed him by not
attending.
</P>
<P>
   Also, two Democratic senators, Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings of
South Carolina and Barbara Boxer of California, strongly criticized
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fed up,'' said Hollings. ``The behavior, the dishonesty
of the president is unacceptable, and we'll see with the report
what course the Congress will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, whose daughter married Hillary Rodham Clinton's younger
brother in the White House in 1994, described the president's
behavior as ``wrong,'' ``indefensible'' and ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry said that in
addition Wednesday's meeting with House Democrats, the president is
trying to arrange to meet Thursday with Republican and Democratic
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a number of things he wants to say to them, a
number of things he wants to ask them about,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of
anonomity put it this way: ``Bill Clinton has a lot more to fear
from Congress than he does from the public. . . . The political
community is on the verge of panic, and the public is aghast at the
panic they're seeing from the political community.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, aides have scheduled a busy week for the
president to showcase him as focused on the people's work. After
meeting with Democratic leaders, Clinton will fly to Florida to
promote his education agenda and to attend Democratic Party
fund-raisers. Later in the week, he will promote auto safety, host
a breakfast for religious leaders and attend a memorial service for
victims of the US embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have left open the possibility that Clinton
will add to his public comments about the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you'll see are a lot of small tactical moves designed day
by day to keep the situation from deteriorating further,'' said
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different views right now about what needs to
be done, a lot of confusion, not panic, but real uncertainty,'' he
said. ``They are waiting for the other shoe to drop, until they
know what a clunker that shoe is going to be, they are very
uncertain about how to proceed.''

2 MORE PROMINENT DEMOCRATS REPRIMAND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., S.C., Texas, Mich., N.Y., Fla., Ill., Miss.)  (Eds: See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two more Senate Democrats Tuesday delivered
stinging rebukes of President Clinton, condemning what they said
was his ``dishonesty'' and ``immoral'' behavior. The chorus of
critics within the president's own party has gained volume as
lawmakers return to Washington anticipating a report from the
independent counsel investigating Clinton any day now.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who is a relative of Clinton's and
who is locked in a tough Senate race, took to the Senate floor
Tuesday morning and chastised the president for failing to take
``responsibility much earlier,'' calling his behavior ``wrong and
indefensible'' and ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's daughter married Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother in the
White House in 1994. But Boxer's press spokesman, David Sandretti,
said Tuesday that the senator, who made a point of defending
Clinton's leadership on policy issues, had no conversation with
anyone in the White House or any Clinton relative before making her
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, another Democrat who also faces a tough
re-election bid, Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings of South Carolina,
took aim at Clinton Tuesday in his home state, saying: ``We're fed
up. The behavior, the dishonesty of the president is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers delivered their remarks one day before the
House returns to session to face the daunting task of reviewing a
report by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. The report on possibly
impeachable offenses could arrive in the House as early as this
week, House Republican and Democratic aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders are preparing to hold a series of meetings on
Wednesday on how to grapple with the inquiry, including one between
Democrats and the president.
</P>
<P>
   And in an apparent change of heart, a number of key Democrats
said Tuesday that Starr's report should immediately be made public
in its entirety, a position that breaks with prior calls to keep it
secret. A host of Republicans, including Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
of Texas, have also demanded that the report be made public,
arguing that the public has the right to see and know more than may
be offered in a simple ``executive summary.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for full and prompt disclosure of the report _ perhaps
with some names redacted for privacy reasons _ appears to be
gaining momentum, Republican and Democratic aides close to the
inquiry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing and legitimate school of thought that says
let's go ahead and put the whole thing out, sink or swim,'' said
one high-ranking Democratic leadership aide.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was the first to call for full
disclosure in an Aug. 27 letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich. Since
then, others, including Reps. Charles Rangel of New York and Robert
Wexler of Florida, have added their voices. Both say that sensitive
grand jury testimony and names should be redacted from the report
before its release.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and ranking member
Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., both agree that an executive
summary of the report should be released to all members of
Congress, with the full report going only to committee members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This should not be done in secret, or by suppressing
something,'' Dingell said. ``The people need to know. This is a
judgment we're making on their behalf. Taxpayers spent $40 million
on this document. They have a right to know what's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel added Tuesday, ``There is no question that the substance
of the accusations have to be made public because it's going to get
leaked anyway and everyone between now and election will be putting
their spin on it. I don't see that we have an option.''
</P>
<P>
   One House Democratic aide said some Democrats simply fear being
``blindsided'' by the White House before the November elections if
the report is not made available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler argued that making the document public could allow
Clinton to respond, if his request to review the report before it
is sent to Congress is rejected by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president needs to have an opportunity to respond to Ken
Starr's allegations and conclusions to the extent that they are
contained in the report,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing themselves for the inquiry, Republicans and Democrats
have scheduled an important series of meetings on Wednesday to
begin planning how best to handle the report, both procedurally and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who is deeply concerned about the erosion of
support among Democrats in Congress, plans to meet Wednesday
morning with the senior eight members of the House Democratic
leadership at the White House. Members are expecting an apology
from the president for deceiving them, House Democratic aides said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry described the meeting as
focusing on the congressional agenda as well as the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican leaders will huddle at a ``retreat'' in
the afternoon to sort out their strategies. And in the morning
House leaders from both parties, including Hyde and Conyers, are
expected to come together to discuss House procedures for handling
Starr's report. Democrats are opposed to a bid by Hyde to garner
what aides call ``unprecedented powers'' for his committee, such as
the ability to subpoena witnesses and cite witnesses for contempt
without a full House vote, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Hyde have both said that it is important the
process be bipartisan. And Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of
the House Rules Committee, has said he wants to grant only a few
exceptions to existing House procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday a House Republican aide described the matter as
``fluid,'' while the Democrats' chief counsel on the Judiciary
Committee described the two sides as being ``a long way off on
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the whole inquiry could be wrapped up before the
election, as some Democrats and Republicans are hoping, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said he didn't think so.

 &HT;    Close-up on Sprout
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What: Sprout, a one-year-old company, sells equipment and data
to bookstores so they can print a book, on request, in about 10
minutes. The system, printer and access to a digital database,
start at about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Who: Henry Topping, 29, and Pat Brannan, 34. Before attending
grad school at the University of Virginia, Topping worked in asset
management. Brannan was a Navy pilot and Gulf War veteran who later
worked as an emulsion processing consultant in the oil refinery
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue: None. Yet. Topping said they are one to two months away
from earning revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Current location: The Advanced Technology Development Center at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Web address: http://www.sproutinfo.com
</P>
<P>
   Beginnings: The company began as a second-year grad school class
contest. Topping and Brannan won the contest and graduated from
U.Va. in May 1997. Sprout started in Atlanta the next month.
</P>
<P>
   They chose Atlanta over New York, a more logical choice for a
company dependent upon relationships with publishing companies,
partly because Brannan's wife took a job with Coca-Cola and, in
part, because Atlanta was a better place for a small business,
Topping said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration: Expensive, hard-to-find books.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing their MBA degrees, Topping and Brannan were
struck by how expensive the textbooks they needed for class were.
Most were about $65 and hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a combination of sticker shock and an inability to
deliver books when they were needed,'' Topping said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer response: Pat Cunningham is vice president of
operations and one of the owners of the Engineer's Bookstore, on
Marietta Street near Georgia Tech. Sprout will use the Marietta
Street (in downtown Atlanta) store as a test site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps bookstores vibrant in the changing marketplace,''
Cunningham said. ``You can look online and decide if you want to
buy. It keeps bookstores in the supply chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's store carries a lot of high-priced textbooks,
averaging about $60, which can drive up inventory costs. ``With an
idea like Sprout, I don't have to have a product on my shelf to be
able to sell it. It's another channel to deliver product.''

POLICE RUSHED RALLY STAGE AFTER BEING ATTACKED, CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir, offering a new
explanation for why his officers stormed the stage at the end of
Saturday's youth rally in Harlem, said Tuesday that they rushed
forward only after they were pelted by bricks, bottles, metal
barriers and other objects, many of them hurled from the speaking
platform itself.
</P>
<P>
   Safir and Chief of Patrol John Scanlon, the ranking commander at
the scene Saturday, said that a phalanx of officers in riot helmets
first began moving toward a set of generators, which were located
behind and to the right of the platform, to cut power to the sound
system being used by keynote speaker Khallid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had said police took over the
stage because Muhammad began urging the crowd to fight and even
shoot officers if provoked. Earlier, the mayor had said that the
officers moved in to enforce a strict timetable that called for the
rally to be shut down promptly at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the account offered Tuesday, Scanlon said: ``When we moved,
our objective was the generator, to cut the sound. We only went to
the stage to secure our safety and the safety of other civilians in
the area because debris continued to come off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's more detailed account came as Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced that he had begun a
grand jury investigation of the events at the end of the rally,
called the Million Youth March. Morgenthau said the investigation
would be certain to include any assaults on police officers. In
addition, he said, investigators would consider possible charges of
incitement to riot, a misdemeanor, against Muhammad. Safir and
Giuliani have urged that he face such charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered calls for community healing were drowned
out Tuesday by the growing recriminations, threats of civil rights
lawsuits, and calls for investigations by everyone from the U.S.
Justice Department to the New York Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the antagonists in this continuing saga showed no sign of
tiring, trading strikingly similar barbs from a distance of 230
miles. Safir, to the approbation of Giuliani, called Muhammad a
``black Hitler,'' while in Washington, Malik Zulu Shabazz,
Muhammad's top aide, likened Giuliani to a tyrant sitting back in a
``fascist, Adolf Hitler-type tower,'' sending the police ``out to
do evil work against the community.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Tuesday, Safir angrily defended his
department's actions, saying the police had ensured ``that a
hate-monger who came here to cause trouble was not allowed to do
that, and the citizens of this city were protected from people who
wanted a riot and did not have one.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was necessary for the officers to wear riot
gear, for their own protection. ``Somebody said to me, `How come
they were wearing helmets and riot gear?''' Safir said. ``Well,
thank God they were wearing helmets, because one of our police
officers was hit in the head with a brick and probably would have
been dead or severely brain-injured had she not been wearing her
helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir refused to discuss the reasons for some of the Police
Department's actions, however, such as the decision to send a
helicopter flying low over the crowd on Malcolm X Boulevard. ``I'm
setting the record straight on the facts of what occurred,'' he
said. ``I'm not going into specific tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the move toward the stage, Scanlon said that at about
3:45 p.m., one of the event promoters promised to cut off the
generators promptly at 4 p.m.. ``I asked him as a sign of good
faith to move the gentleman who was standing in front of the
generator, and he said he would,'' the chief recalled. ``He not
only didn't do that, he reinforced it with large numbers of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Police photographers videotaped the rally and the demonstration
at its close from several angles. Saturday, the department shared
with reporters some of that tape, of Muhammad's remarks. Tuesday, a
spokeswoman for Safir refused to allow a reporter to view the
department's videotape of the melee behind the stage, saying that
those images were being forwarded to the district attorney's office
and had thus become evidence in the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Morgenthau said he had decided
to begin the grand jury investigation based largely on accounts of
the clash provided by several of his own investigators, including
Leroy Frazier, who oversees Morgenthau's Harlem office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there was a serious chance of confrontations and
difficulty, so we had three or four people there,'' Morgenthau
said. Frazier, who also heads the district attorney's special
prosecutions bureau, will direct the grand jury investigation,
Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that the inquiry would extend to any criminal
activity, whether by demonstrators, speakers or police. He added,
however, that he had yet to hear of any crime committed by an
officer at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, ``there are certain things that we know
happened.'' Among them, he said, Officer Julie McNichols of the
Bronx Task Force was struck in the helmet by a brick and knocked
unconscious, and Officer Christopher Williams of the Manhattan
South Task Force was stabbed in the hand and hit with a metal
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, investigators said they have identified just one
alleged assailant, using the police videotapes. The man, James
Washington of Brooklyn, who is also known as Shaheed Muhammad, was
expected to surrender Tuesday. Morgenthau said the man had hurled a
brick at the rally Saturday and had also assaulted a police
community affairs officer who was sitting outside a news conference
held by the rally organizers in Brooklyn on Sunday.

TOP U.N. ARMS INSPECTOR ANSWERS CRITICISM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Butler, chief U.N. arms inspector for
Iraq, said on Tuesday that he was disturbed by the Senate testimony
of a former American inspector who resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., said that the
administration and the United Nations had been too conciliatory
toward Iraq and had undermined the inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   In the chief inspector's first critical comments on Ritter's
statements since he resigned on Aug. 26, Butler said in an
interview that Ritter's testimony was often inaccurate in
chronology and detail and had damaged the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that Ritter had also inflated his role and made
misleading statements about Butler's dealings with Security Council
officials, and particularly with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Butler spoke as the council appeared to be near agreement on an
American-sponsored resolution to keep sanctions on Iraq
indefinitely, without hope of a review, until Baghdad reverses its
decision of Aug. 5 to end intrusive searches for arms, weapons
parts and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the unanimity of the council for the resolution ``is
not going to be an extremely difficult process,'' said the council
president for September, Hans Dahlgren of Sweden. This is expected
to be a critical month for American and other diplomats as they try
to rebuild a shattered consensus for stronger action against Iraq
if all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have begun to talk of possible military action,
but the council is a long way from that moment.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the American policy has been to avoid frequent
confrontations with Iraq, which has for the last year gained
something from each periodic blowup, and choose instead a solid
front of resistance when diplomatic efforts have run their course.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, Butler said that Ritter's portrayal of
the U.N. Special Commission was rife with misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and at a Senate hearing last week, Ritter said the
administration, the Security Council and Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had undermined the efforts of the commission to find and
destroy Iraq's clandestine biological, chemical, nuclear and
certain prohibited missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that the commission had many tasks to perform and
that Ritter was involved in only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aspect for which Scott Ritter held a key responsibility,
mainly Iraq's policy and practice of concealment, is only one of
several things that we do,'' Butler said. ``Unscom was and is far
more than the concealment issue,'' he added, using the acronym for
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom has a dedicated team of men and women, and they are
continuing to do its work. Scott Ritter was a member of that team,
and as I made clear when he resigned, he was a very valuable member
of it. But the idea that somehow his departure means a breakdown in
the work of all those other good women and men is a
misconception.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler has been most disturbed by Ritter's accusations that the
agency canceled investigations as a direct result of pressure from
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Scott Ritter's chronology of events is not
accurate,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go about making claims like this about who did what
with which and to whom on dates and times and places unless you get
the story right, or otherwise it's misleading,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Butler refused to provide details or examples, saying only that
the overall impression Ritter gave ``is not accurate.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Montreal Expos
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (18-6, 2.61 ERA;
15-11, 3.55 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Dustin Hermanson (13-10,
3.08; 1-2, 3.50 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Glavine gets his second shot at his 19th victory. He's
coming off a tough 2-1 loss to the Mets last Friday in New York.
Although he allowed just five hits in seven innings, one was
decisive: Mike Piazza's monstrous two-run homer in the fourth
inning. Glavine can still become the NL's first 19-game winner
against the Expos, who bombed him early in his career but whom
Glavine has owned in recent years. In his lone start against
Montreal this season, he went 6 2/3 innings in Atlanta on June 13
and, despite allowing 11 hits and six runs (earned), got the win in
the Braves' 9-7 victory. Javy Lopez and Andruw Jones homered
back-to-back off Mike Johnson, then back-to-back again in their
next at-bats. Once a reliever with San Diego, Hermanson is thriving
in his second season as a starter with Montreal. He's won nine of
his last 13 decisions, beginning with a 4-1 win over the Braves in
the Big O on June 21. That day, the hard-throwing right-hander went
eight strong innings, giving up five hits and one run on Michael
Tucker's seventh-inning solo homer. His ERA dropped that day to
2.96; now at 3.08, it's still sixth-best in the NL (Glavine's
fourth at 2.61).

 &HT;    Kucera outlasts Agassi in match of mind games
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Karol Kucera felt Andre Agassi had done him wrong,
then winning was the best revenge.
</P>
<P>
   After losing five straight games to trail 2-0 in the fifth set
Tuesday, the ninth-seeded Kucera saved two break points and won
6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 1-6, 6-3 to reach his first-ever quarterfinal
in a U.S. Open. It was a rain-delayed match contested over two days
and enlivened by some Agassi gamesmanship that went over well with
a partisan full house of 9,500 at Louis Armstrong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's day one, Agassi was down two sets and a service
break in the third when he began protesting the Slovak's habit of
stopping his service motion to catch his errant tosses. After
Kucera's fifth false-start in one game and about 12 for the match,
Agassi stopped play to complain to chair umpire Norm Chryst.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times is he allowed to do that?'' Agassi asked
Chryst. When told it was legal, Agassi left Chryst with, ``So I can
do it on every serve, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Chryst didn't answer. ``He just gave me that stupid look he
gives,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   A few points later, Agassi called for time just as Kucera was
serving against a break point at 3-1. Made to serve again, Kucera
missed his first serve, and Agassi drove his second into the
backhand corner, unreturnable, further inciting the crowd to his
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some stage, after 15, 16, 18, whether he meant it or not,
it's unacceptable,'' Agassi said of Kucera's interrupted serves.
``It's asking a lot of a player to put up with that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the changeover, Agassi mocked Kucera by catching his own
service tosses prior to four different points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a little bit unfair from Andre,'' Kucera said,
``because I didn't do this on purpose. My ball toss was not good,
especially when you are under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the set, Agassi began looping moon balls at Kucera.
Agassi said he did it to help him refocus on constructing points
and improving shot selection, but Kucera thought Agassi was playing
mind games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for me to stay concentrated,'' Kucera said.
``When somebody is doing something bad to you, then you're thinking
about what he's doing and you don't think about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi led 3-0 in the fourth set when rain ended the night. On
Tuesday, Agassi had two break points for 3-0 lead in the fifth.
Agassi credited Kucera for stepping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it was all about tennis,'' Agassi said. ``Last night,
it just got to the point where it was so competitive, we could've
put on boxing golves, thrown darts, anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucera called it ``the most interesting match I've ever
played.''

BOEING, AIRBUS SPLIT ORDERS WORTH $7 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Splitting what some analysts say could be parts of
largest pot of business remaining in this economic cycle, The
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie Tuesday announced airplane orders
worth a combined $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus won orders totaling about $4.3 billion to sell up to 10
long-range A340-500 jets and six A320 short-haul planes to
International Lease Finance Corp., an airplane leasing company, and
as many as 16 A340s to Emirates Airlines. The orders are a setback
for Boeing, which was hoping to sell ILFC and Emirates on
longer-range, higher-performance versions of the 777 that would
have greater range and more performance than current models.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Dennis, vice president of Boeing's commercial group, said
Boeing continues to actively market the new versions of the 777.
``I would say we are very close to launching,'' he said. ``As a
marketing guy, I'd like to see it happen immediately, but I think
we are very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing won an order from the Brazilian carrier Varig, the
largest airline in Latin America, worth about $2.7 billion. It is
for the sale of four 777s, 10 next generation 737-800s, four next
generation 737-700s, six extended range 767-300s, plus options for
four 777-200s and 11 737-700s. The Varig sale helped take some of
the sting out of Airbus's $3.5 billion order, announced in March,
from a group of airlines in Brazil, Chile and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing President Harry Stonecipher made an appearance for the
Varig announcement, saying, ``We have not left the field of
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   But as if to underline the uncertainty in the aircraft market,
Brazil was in the midst of a currency crisis of its own. Its
central bank had just put up the interbank lending rate from 19
percent to 29.75 percent in an effort to defend its currency, the
real.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Fernando Vivanco said airlines such as Varig
``typically make major purchase decisions every 10, 15 or 20
years,'' and that a short-term crisis would not affect the decision
or the quality of the order.
</P>
<P>
   John Plueger, chief operating officer of International Lease
Finance Corp., was asked whether this is a wise time to be buying
this many planes, which would be delivered from 2002 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has certainly reached a crescendo and it's
possible there will be some softening in the next few years,'' he
said. ``But our own internal estimates are that time period between
2002 and 2006 is going to be very, very robust.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And actually we are actually quite bullish about a
strong recovery in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia is the key that divides the industry bulls from the bears.
Boeing's ``1998 Current Market Outlook'' forecasts an annual growth
rate for short-haul flights within Asia of 7.6 percent through 2007
_ a figure higher than Europe or North America _ and a 6.8 percent
annual growth in Asia-to-Europe flights.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Corp. money manager Bill Whitlow, who has followed Boeing
for years, says it's fairly clear that Boeing's production will hit
a cyclical peak next year. ``The question is how much it
declines,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Aseritis of Credit Suisse First Boston forecasts a
drop-off from about 610 planes next year to about 500 a year for
the next few years after that. Ed Greenslet of The Airline Monitor
forecasts a drop to 320 planes by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one question is Asia, and in Asia, the number one
question is Japan,'' Whitlow says. The more optimistic forecasts
assume that Japan's economy finally recovers. The pessimists assume
a global recession.

BRAZIL ACTS TO SPUR EXPORTS, LIMIT SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Caught between the urgency of stanching
a near-hemorrhage of hard currency from the country and the demands
of approaching presidential elections, the Brazilian government
announced modest measures Tuesday to stimulate exports and contain
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would simplify cumbersome bureaucratic
procedures for exports worth less than $10,000, and would allow
foreigners to pay for Brazilian exports with international credit
cards. The plan's goal is to increase exports 15 percent a year, in
the hope that they will reach $100 billion a year by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The government also announced a 20 percent across-the-board
budget cut for national agencies for the rest of 1998. The step
represented an about-face as capital for emerging markets grows
scarcer. Three months ago, officials had lifted more modest
spending limits on federal agencies, as President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso prepared to start his campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But investors saw Tuesday's steps as perhaps too modest. ``They
affect the domestic debt, but the market has not interpreted them
as a way to reduce our crisis,'' said Rafael Cardoso, vice
president of Sudameris Bank. ``The government's trying to reduce
spending, but there's not much margin for maneuver,'' added
Cardoso, who is not related to the Brazilian president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after starting the day with strong gains, the nation's
benchmark stock index ended slightly lower, losing steam in
afternoon trading after the government measures were announced.
Indeed, despite a 5 percent surge on Wall Street Tuesday, most
Latin American stock markets seemed to reflect the uncertainty over
Brazil, closing off or, in the case of Mexico, with modest gains.
In the bond market, the Brazilian government was able to sell $510
million worth Tuesday, roughly a fifth of the total it had offered.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the government's measures came across as
tepid. James Barrineau of Salomon Smith Barney said the steps to
curtail spending would do little more than offset the higher costs
associated with an interest rate increase last week. ``There's
still a lot of uncertainty in terms of whether this will be
enough,'' Barrineau said. ``The perception is, it's not what people
were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Chile, too, sought some relief from economic troubles by
focusing on commercial trade. Officials in Santiago announced plans
to cut down on so-called exchange dumping, by restricting imports
from countries that had devalued their currencies. At the same time
it is moving to lower general tariffs to 6 percent from 11 percent.
With the fall in prices for copper, a third of Chile's exports, and
the troubles in Asia, Chile's commercial deficit has reached $3
billion, about $1 billion more than economists forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, Brazil has been spending about $1
billion a day in foreign reserves to shore up its currency, the
real, which economists say is overvalued by 10 to 20 percent. On
Friday, it lost $2.7 billion in reserves, as Latin American finance
ministers ended a meeting with the International Monetary Fund with
no solid pledge of assistance for their floundering economies. On
Thursday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Brazilian bonds to
the debt levels of Nicaragua and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   The losses prompted the government to effectively raise
Brazilian interest rates to 29.75 percent after markets closed
Friday, just as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan,
indicated that he was increasingly concerned about a spreading
danger to world markets _ a statement many interpreted as an
openness at the Fed to lowering U.S. interest rates. In Washington
last week, Latin American finance ministers had been clamoring for
just such help.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The increase in the central bank's assistance rate for banks,
called the T-Ban, was expected to cost the Brazilian government
$1.3 billion more a month in interest payments on its debt,
Barrineau said, but it was seen as an essential step in slowing the
flight of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has labored to project calm, orderly
preparation for the financial storm that threatens to strike here
after devastating economies in Asia and Russia, it has been
speaking with somewhat conflicting voices.
</P>
<P>
   It raised interest rates just two days after lowering them. In
announcing the increase, Francisco Lopes, the director of the
central bank, warned that ``the government now has to work in the
fiscal area to help defend the real.'' But Cardoso, who is running
for re-election on Oct. 4, chided reporters for suggesting that ``a
package'' of spending cuts was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Package is a disagreeable phrase that gives the impression you
are going to pass a set of measures that will take the country by
surprise,'' he said on Monday. ``We are not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting voices coming from Brasilia, the capital, are a
mirror of officials' conflicting needs. Cardoso, who wants to be
re-elected, wishes to cause as little economic pain as possible. At
the same time, Brazil must convince lenders and the markets that
its economic plans and economy are credible.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardoso administration has largely avoided effective
measures to balance expenses over the last four years, making it
more vulnerable to shortages in dollar reserves. Brazil is expected
to end the year with a deficit of 8 percent, and expectations for
growth are running under 2 percent. J.P. Morgan predicted last week
that the economy would shrink 2 percent, and forecasts for next
year are not much better.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not bolster its credibility by releasing a
1999 budget that relied on projections of 4 percent growth.
Brazil's unemployment, at 8 percent, is up by almost half over last
year, and at the worst levels since the debt crisis of the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Tuesday that stimulating exports would
create 500,000 jobs. And it predicted that the restrictions on
spending would create a ``primary surplus'' of $5 billion in 1998
and $8.7 billion in 1999. The figure do not include interest
payments on debt. Brazil's budget deficit, given the government's
projections, would drop to about 5 percent of the gross domestic
product. The country faces a current account deficit of $40
billion.

   AURORA, Colo. _ A 17-year-old boy in police custody is a suspect
in a Labor Day shooting rampage that killed five other teen-agers
and one woman, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police and witnesses said the suspect, Alexander Pagosian, and a
friend, Michael Martinez, 18, were carrying shotguns and had pulled
bandanas over their faces when they entered two houses in the
suburbs of Aurora, east of Denver on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They shot and killed Greg Medla, 18, his girlfriend, Marissa
Aravalos, 16, and his mother, Penny Medla, 37, at the first house,
and Eddie Morales and Zachary Over at the second house, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Martinez was found dead in a field about 10
miles away, where he had been shot repeatedly with a handgun,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, police received a call from Pagosian, which led
them to him. Both suspects are from Aurora and the police said they
had criminal records. Martinez was expelled from high school last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The killings constituted the largest multiple-slaying in
Colorado in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them knew each other,'' J. Michael Stiers, Aurora's
deputy police chief, said at a news conference Tuesday. He declined
to discuss motive, or to say whether drugs or gangs were involved.
</P>
<P>
   A witness to the shootings, which occurred on two tree-lined
streets in solidly middle-class subdivisions, said that the two men
had left the crime scene and walked toward Martinez's home two
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked out with their guns wide open and headed to the
apartments,'' a 15-year-old boy named Derrick said. Speaking
through a locked screen door, he refused to give his last name,
saying: ``If they are cold enough to walk in there in broad
daylight with their guns out, then who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Mary Lyle, said Penny Medla's seven-year-old
daughter, Kayla, had run out of her house screaming, ``Michael shot
my Mom.'' The police said that Martinez was a family acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your economic standing doesn't protect you from it,'' said
Mrs. Lyle, adding that she and her husband just finished building
their house and were moving in. ``We built this as our dream house,
but it started with a nightmare.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Homicides in this city of 200,000 jumped last year to 17, from
11 in 1996. In 1993, a robbery here at a fast-food restaurant by an
employee left four dead.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1997 homicide rate of seven per 100,000 in Aurora,
Colorado's third largest city after Denver and Colorado Springs,
was still half the rate of Denver's rate of 15 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   FBI statistics collected last year for the nation's 38 mid-sized
cities show Aurora ranking third in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Aurora has been a conservative city shaped by defense
employers _ Lowry Air Force Base, Fitzsimmons Army Hospital and
Buckley Air National Guard Base. Since 1990, change has been rapid:
Lowry and Fitzsimmons closed and the population surged 17 percent.

 &HT;    How we mark our milestones
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A kid should catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It's only appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Because, like it or not, the future begins with home run No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Maris era is boxed, wrapped and archived as
soon as 62 leaves Mark McGwire's bat. As Jim Lovell said when
Apollo 13 lifted off, the clock is running.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time before baseball, before the impersonal
constraints of clock time and calendar time, when the king's reign,
floods or plague marked passages in human lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now we mark time with records. Baseball is our way of keeping
score. Baseball heroes and their deeds define cultural epochs. Home
run records are just rare enough to offer the same perspective a
mountain peak offers _ an unobstructed view back across the valley
to other peaks.
</P>
<P>
   When old records die, something dies in us. Mortality whispers.
</P>
<P>
   If you were 10 in 1961, you're middle-aged today, and you can
take the measure of your life from Maris to McGwire. It's a nice,
simple calibrating device, more effective, more emotional, more
personal than a calendar. Sit back, close your eyes, and follow
your life's story from those days of big cars, JFK and Mercury
space capsules. When McGwire launches 62, the chapter ends.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a kid back in 1961, Babe Ruth's 1927 record was, for
you, a distant, prehistoric event, like World War I and Al Capone.
Maris brought baseball, and you, into the modern era. It was a
beginning, like Sputnik, the transistor, jet flight. Grunts in
Vietnamese rice paddies debated whether Mickey Mantle was the
better hero than Maris, whether Dustin Hoffman could act, whether
Janis Joplin could sing. Babe Ruth was history.
</P>
<P>
   For your uncles in Normandy foxholes who talked of the Babe and
Greta Garbo and Ty Cobb, Maris came to mark the end. Their giant
Emerson radios went to the garage. The '38 Dodge went to the scrap
pile. Their pinup girls got old. The Babe died.
</P>
<P>
   If you're 40 today and think Roger Maris and his record have no
personal meaning for you, you're wrong. Your kids will talk about
the McGwire era, and they'll remember you in terms of Before and
After No. 62. You, and Roger Maris, will be part of the last era.
</P>
<P>
   And if you remember George Herman Ruth sending No. 60 skyward,
you know you have lived a long life. Mark McGwire's feat cannot
help but fill you with a sense of loss, of remembrances of old
friends, hopes realized, dreams dashed. You've been here for most
of the century, and the century is ending.
</P>
<P>
   A kid should catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire belongs to all of us, but the ball belongs to the
future and the future belongs to the kid.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe took America into a new age: the Hero as Everyman.
</P>
<P>

NIKOS KEFALIDIS, 55, REAL-ESTATE DEVELOPER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nikos Kefalidis, a real-estate developer and founder
of KLM Construction Inc., was among the 229 passengers who died on
Swissair Flight 111 when it plunged into the sea off Peggy's Cove,
Nova Scotia, last Wednesday. He was 55 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Kefalidis (pronounced keff-a-LEE-deez) had been on the flight en
route to Istanbul for the wedding of a boyhood classmate.
</P>
<P>
   He was reared in humble circumstances in the Greek town of
Alexandroupolis, near the Turkish border. His ancestors were Greek
refugees from the Pontos region near the Black Sea in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At age 9, he was sent on a scholarship to Anavryta College, a
boarding school near Athens, and he later studied at the University
of Athens, where he received a degree in economics. He came to the
United States in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the only jobs he could get was as a house painter,''
said Grant Ruthizer, a vice president of KLM Construction Inc., and
of Beta Steel, a privately owned steel mill in Portage, Ind., that
Kefalidis helped found. ``Then he moved from being a painter to
establishing his own painting company and from that to general
contracting and property development. He built several thousand
residential apartments in Brooklyn and Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now some 20 projects in the company's pipeline,
Ruthizer said, including the construction of an 80,000-square-foot
Old Navy store on a lot Kefalidis owned opposite Macy's on West
34th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In June, despite some vocal opposition, Community Board 1 in
Queens County voted to approve a zoning change that would permit
his firm to convert an old Steinway piano factory in Astoria into a
$30-million project that would include 142 assisted-living units
for the elderly and 163 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Kefalidis was also involved in the development of Showboat
Casino, a riverboat complex in East Chicago, Ind. ``He had a
passion for the deal and for negotiating, and he loved property,''
Ruthizer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Kefalidis and a partner bought the village hall of
Bellport on Long Island, only hours after they had first laid eyes
on it. Asked what had prompted the purchase, he said: ``I saw an ad
this morning that the building was for sale. We decided to come out
and bid on it. We'll rent it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a leader in numerous political, civic and religious
organizations and became a member of the Democratic National
Committee in 1994. He was vice president of the board of the
Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on the Upper East Side
and on the Archdiocesan Council of the Greek Orthodox Church in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated everyone with the same deference and affection,
from bricklayer to head of government,'' said Toli Fliakos, a vice
president and assistant chairman of Beta Steel, in whose wedding
Kefalidis had served as best man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once noticed that something seemed to be bothering one of
his employees,'' Fliakos recalled. ``He dragged it out of the man,
and it turned out that he was concerned about not having enough
money to pay his daughter's private school tuition. Nikos said, `Is
that the problem? Go to the office and get a check tomorrow.' He
did things like that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a message of condolence to a memorial
service for Kefalidis that was led Tuesday night at the cathedral
by Archbishop Iakovos, the former primate of the Greek Orthodox
Church of North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Kefalidis is survived by his wife of 18 years, Laurie Doane
Kefalidis, and their three children, Melanie, 17, Elias, 14, and
Marisa, 8, all of Manhattan; his parents, Symeon and Kerasia
Kefalidis, of Alexandroupolis; a brother, Chrysanthos Kefalidis, of
Athens; and a sister, Efthimia Melidis, of Alexandroupolis.

 &HT;    Diesel plant will be major joint venture; GM plans job
elimination
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The diesel engine plant to be built by General
Motors Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. in Moraine will be one of the
largest joint ventures ever between a Japanese and United States
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers at a GM parts plant in Kettering on Tuesday
received details of a tentative agreement that would prevent GM
from selling or closing the troubled plant for four years. But the
agreement also calls for the elimination of 400 jobs, mostly
through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the $300 million diesel engine plant in Moraine
to employ 700 workers and produce more than 100,000 engines
annually starting in 2000, the automakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.6 liter, direct injection diesel engines produced at the
plant will be used in GM's new pick-up trucks and some full-size
sport utility vehicles, GM officials said. Jack Smith, GM's
chairman and chief executive, and Isuzu Chairman Kazuhira Seki,
will unveil more details about the new plant today at a ceremony in
Moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, recognized as the world's leader in designing and
manufacturing diesel engines, will have a 60 percent controlling
interest in the joint venture called DMAX Ltd. The name is meant to
signify the diesel engine and maximum power. GM will control the
other 40 percent in the new company, but Isuzu is responsible for
production and engineering of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the locally produced diesel engines will be
shipped to U.S. assembly plants, while the other 10 percent will be
exported to Canada, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Isuzu are betting that a new generation of diesel engines
- not the smoky, noisy contraptions of the past - will power the
environmentally friendly ``green'' car of the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But changing environmental regulations and competing
technologies could make the diesel plant a risky investment in a
volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesels and the investments being funneled into them could
shrink very quickly,'' said Joe Phillippi of Lehman Bros. in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the automakers say the new plant would have been
constructed elsewhere if not for an agreement between the
automakers and the International Union of Electronic Workers, which
will represent workers at the new factory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, hourly workers at the existing Moraine Engine
plant approved a three-tier wage scale for hourly employees that
will pay new workers $8.93 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at our work force, we have thousands of years
experience to apply to this new engine,'' said Ed Fire, president
of the International IUE.
</P>
<P>
   The new plant will be located between Ohio 741 and Dryden Road
near GM's Moraine truck assembly and engine plants. The existing
diesel engine plant in Moraine employs about 500 workers and is
expected to be closed next year. About 300 of those workers will be
transferred to the new plant, while the other 200 are eligible for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   GM has had a stake in Isuzu since 1971 and makes small pickups
for the Japanese company in the United States. Isuzu has 13,000
employees worldwide and is Japan's largest truck maker.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, GM and another Japanese automaker, Toyota, have
operated a 50-50 joint venture called the New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont, Calif., which employs 4,700 United
Auto Workers. The massive plant, located 20 miles south of Oakland,
Calif., makes the Chevy Prizm for GM and the Tacoma pickup truck
and Corolla for Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   The NUMMI joint venture resurrected nearly 5,000 UAW jobs when
it started making vehicles for GM and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any resistance from the UAW in working with
Toyota when it opened and both partners have shown a strong
interest in continuing their relationship for years to come,'' said
Michael Damer, spokesman for NUMMI.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering plant workers will receive more details of an
agreement that could determine the future of the factory that
employs 2,700 hourly workers. The plant makes shocks and struts for
GM and other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the plant said the agreement will offer the
workers job security for the next four years, but will reduce the
plant's employment level by 400 jobs. The pact also places a cap on
part of the plant's three-tier wage scale, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering plant has been targeted for sale or shutdown for
more than two years due to financial losses. The plant has lost $50
million over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, represented by IUE Local 755, will vote on the
agreement Thursday.

STARR EXPECTED TO SUBMIT REPORT TO CONGRESS IN NEXT FEW DAYS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dismissing objections from the White House, Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, plans to deliver a
report to Congress, as early as the end of this week, summarizing
his eight-month inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, allies of Starr said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr intends to alert House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a letter
on Wednesday that he will submit his report containing substantial
and credible evidence that may be the grounds for impeachment of
the president, according to lawyers familiar with Starr's plans.
Prosecutors are also planning to convene the grand jury here on
Thursday, in a signal that it will continue its criminal inquiry
even after a report is sent to the House of Representatives, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to accuse the president of perjury in a
civil deposition, obstruction of justice, lying to a grand jury,
witness tampering and abuse of power, the lawyers said. It is
likely to include an embarrassing description of Clinton's conduct
with Ms. Lewinsky and a scorching appraisal of his use of White
House lawyers and claims of privilege in response to the inquiry
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a prickly four-page letter incongruously addressed ``Dear
David,'' Starr on Tuesday rejected a request from David Kendall,
the president's private lawyer, for an advance review of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to gain his political footing as Democratic senators
continued to pummel him on Tuesday for his behavior, Clinton
hastily set up a meeting for 8:30 a.m. Wednesday with House
Democratic leaders. Advisers to Clinton said he planned to address
the Lewinsky matter, apologizing and asking forgiveness for
misleading the legislators and the nation, and for potentially
damaging the party's prospects in elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may offer another public apology later this week,
perhaps at a prayer breakfast at the White House on Friday morning,
advisers said. Clinton has made a series of increasingly direct
statements of regret since he acknowledged the relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky in a brief, defiant address on Aug. 17, after seven
months of denials.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to come back into session on Wednesday
afternoon, and the White House is anxious to smother the Democratic
criticism that began rising in the Senate last Thursday, when Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, trailed by other Democrats, took
to the floor to denounce Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, previously reluctant Democrats, including Sen.
Barbara Boxer of California, joined the chorus of criticism. Ms.
Boxer, whose daughter married a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton,
called Clinton's behavior ``immoral'' and ``indefensible,'' while
defending his agenda and accomplishments in a speech on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued in a letter to Starr on Monday that the special
prosecutor had no legal authority to write a report analyzing his
findings _ but that if he chose to do so, he had an obligation out
of ``fundamental fairness'' to permit an advance review by
Clinton's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr wrote on Tuesday that he had a legal responsibility to
issue a report to Congress analyzing the evidence, and no authority
to provide a preview to the White House. He refused to acknowledge
that he was preparing a report, but as he cited sources from the
Constitution to Webster's dictionary, he left little doubt as to
how high he considers the stakes in his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view,'' he wrote, ``it is for Congress, the repository
of impeachment power, to decide if and when such information should
be provided to your client.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also made it clear that he believes his prosecutors have
wide latitude in the preparation of a report. He quoted Alexander
Hamilton, who wrote in The Federalist papers that impeachment
proceedings should not ``be tied down to ... strict rules, either
in the delineation of the offence by the prosecutors, or in the
construction of it by the Judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders also scorned Kendall's request
on Tuesday. ``Why should they get special treatment?'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said to reporters. ``I presume they'll
get it when the House gets it. They'll have a chance to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton adviser outside the White House said that the
president's lawyers might go to court to try to force Starr to
permit them to review the report, perhaps delaying its delivery.
</P>
<P>
   But another senior adviser said that Clinton's lawyers had not
expected Starr to agree to Kendall's request. He said that in
discussions last week, legal and political advisers came to a
consensus that the primary purpose of Kendall's letter was
political, to suggest that Starr was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep.
Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, is scheduled to sit
down with Gingrich and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the
House Judiciary Committee to discuss how to handle the Starr report
when it is delivered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Close advisers of Clinton had not expected Starr to deliver his
report so soon, and some of them are concerned that the White House
is not prepared to respond to it. Kendall asked in his letter to
review the report at least a week before delivery, unsuspecting
that Starr might deliver it to Congress within a week of the letter
itself.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that they expect the report to include
graphic sexual details of the intimate relationship Clinton has
acknowledged with Ms. Lewinsky, whom he met in 1995 when she was a
21-year-old unpaid White House intern. It is the prospect that such
seamy material will be disclosed, these aides said, that has scared
congressional Democrats and prompted them to back away from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The precise contents of the report remain closely held. But
prosecutors have been drafting sections that accuse Clinton of a
variety of crimes, including obstruction of justice and encouraging
others to lie under oath, lawyers familiar with Starr's plans have
said. Prosecutors are also considering whether to accuse Clinton of
perjuring himself in his deposition in January in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in that
deposition. But he said in his address to the nation on Aug. 17
that his reponse was ``legally accurate,'' basing that claim, his
advisers have said, on a definition of sexual relations used by
Mrs. Jones' lawyers. Clinton made a similar claim in grand jury
testimony on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Starr's team might challenge Clinton's
interpretation, and accuse him of perjury before the grand jury,
raises the specter of a tawdry debate over what kind of intimate
contact constitutes sex.
</P>
<P>
   In their exchange of letters, Starr and Kendall quarreled over
everything from the intent of the Founding Fathers to the meaning
of the word ``information.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Starr was permitted by law to provide Congress with
``substantial and credible information,'' Kendall argued that the
prosecutor could not go past that authority to summarize or analyze
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr wrote that his dictionary defined information in part
as ``[k)nowledge derived from study,'' which, he said, left room
for analysis of facts. He wrote that the law also suggested that
prosecutors must use their judgment to determine if evidence is
``substantial and credible'' and whether it ``may constitute
grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' he wrote, ``the independent counsel is duty bound
to provide Congress with his analysis of the information so that
Congress can make its own informed decision.''

painted black, weighs 10,000 pounds; the whole installation, on the
site of a former Navy base, is 500 feet long.

lie'' (Mui's distinction) that the merchandise you want at the
price you want is available elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, set your own  &LR; price before you begin bargaining.
``Do not reveal this figure: When the vendor asks how much you are
willing to pay, counteroffer a price slightly less than your ideal
one. ... Setting your price serves the dual purpose of giving you a
negotiating goal and giving you peace of mind when you attain it.
You may learn later that a friend bought the same item for half the
price, but you, at least, paid an amount you were willing to part
with.''

don't. They're there for you to enjoy or throw out. That's why ears
have holes in 'em; music can go in and out.''

   DALLAS _ Greyhound Lines will formally announce plans on
Wednesday that the company says will make all 4,000 stops on its
nationwide bus system accessible to wheelchair users by October of
next year. But groups representing those users said on Tuesday that
Greyhound planned to equip too few buses with lifts to deliver on
the company's promises.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair users say they depend on Greyhound, the nation's only
comprehensive bus service, because many lack the money to fly and
because Greyhound serves thousands of towns that the airlines do
not. Greyhound must also comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act and with rules the government is only now issuing.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound is pledging that with 48 hours notice it and its
connecting partners will send buses with lifts to take wheelchair
passengers to any station, three years before tentative government
regulations would require this measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal meets the spirit and letter of the Americans
with Disabilities Act and enables us to provide appropriate,
affordable transportation for all Americans,'' Craig Lentzsch,
Greyhound's chief executive, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves 80 buses, or about 4 percent of Greyhound's
current fleet of 2,100. But Marilyn Golden, the policy analyst for
the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said that for
Greyhound's plan to work, at least 15 percent of its fleet, or more
than 300 buses, would require lifts.
</P>
<P>
   From the number of calls to its line for the disabled, Greyhound
estimates that 600 to 1,200 riders a month would benefit from the
lifts, but advocates for the disabled say many more would use the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair users can already arrange, with two days' notice, to
be lifted onto buses, usually by hand, but the handicapped and the
bus line agree that these options are unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   One organization reported that wheelchair users were frequently
dropped, denied service, or refused help in such tasks as going to
the bathrooms at rest stops, though Greyhound calls these stories
exaggerated or false.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound, which is based in Dallas, now has about 20 buses with
lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we're not particularly wheelchair friendly
right now,'' Lentzsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing the disabled have made Greyhound a target,
saying it has been tardy and lax in complying with the Disabilities
Act. ``Greyhound has resisted the letter and spirit of the act
since long before it was passed,'' Ms. Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   In August last year, demonstrators blocked Greyhound buses and
disrupted ticket sales at several major bus stations, including the
Port Authority terminal in New York. ``At least Rosa Parks could
get on the bus,'' demonstrators sang, referring to civil rights
figure from Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Transportation Department's proposed rules to enforce
the Disabilities Act, Greyhound and other major bus lines would
have to equip half their fleets with lifts by 2006, and their
entire fleets by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound has said that too few wheelchair users ride its buses
to justify the $30,000 expense of adding each lift.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing the disabled blame the Department of
Transportation for delaying rules that would have required bus
companies to comply with the 1990 act sooner. The department is now
under a court order to issue its rules this month, Greyhound says.
Michael Winter, the Federal Transit Administration's policy chief,
refused to comment on whether Greyhound's plans would comply with
its rules.

<P>
   Like thousands of other elderly Americans, Eugene DeLorenzo of
Chico, Calif, cannot find a Medicare health maintenance
organization in his area.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorenzo, a 75-year-old retired real estate broker and his
wife, Yuriko, enrolled July 1 in the Medicare plan of Health Net, a
unit of Foundation Health Systems Inc. Just three weeks later,
Health Net _ unable to make a strong profit in Butte County, the
rural northern county where DeLorenzo lives _ said it was ending
its coverage there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Well, what are we going to do now?'''
DeLorenzo recalled. ``It wasn't going to do any good to get angry.
That's just the way these HMOs operate.''
</P>
<P>
   With few options, the DeLorenzos enrolled in traditional
fee-for-service Medicare, the federally financed health care plan
for the disabled and people 65 or older. They may also have to pay
hundreds of dollars more in premiums for a supplemental policy to
replace the generous benefits Health Net had offered.
</P>
<P>
   People like the DeLorenzos are fast becoming common statistics.
After aggressively recruiting the elderly and the disabled into
their Medicare plans, many of the nation's HMOs are now heavily
retreating.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp., once a darling of Wall Street, recently
took a $900 million charge against earnings, in part to scale back
its Medicare operations in 35 counties. In the last year, Aetna,
Pacificare Health Systems, Oxford Health Plans, Foundation Health
Systems, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield
associations have canceled Medicare plans in parts of 13 states.
Virtually no Medicare HMOs are available in Utah or in rural Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicare costs escalating wildly, Congress has long looked
to managed-care plans as the prime remedy. Introduced in 1985 to
allow private insurers to cover the elderly, Medicare HMOs provide
health care more cheaply than the government does. They also tend
to offer more benefits to consumers and reduce the amount of claims
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the HMO problems in the Medicare market, Washington is
now pushing for even more people to enroll in the plans. Yet
financial setbacks for some HMOs have raised serious questions as
to whether they can prosper covering Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Though critics of managed care are quick to say they cannot,
analysts say that several HMOs _ namely Humana Inc. and Pacificare,
two of the nation's largest Medicare providers _ are making money
on their plans, at least for now. But even these companies have had
to make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few HMOs that can be successful with Medicare, and
they should prosper,'' said Kenneth Abramowitz, a health care
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. `` Still, he added, ``Some
of these earnings charges related to Medicare, United Healthcare's
for example, show just how difficult this business is.''
</P>
<P>
   Several problems have bedeviled Medicare HMOs. For one thing,
only 15.6 percent of Medicare's 37.5 million members are enrolled
in Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government says it has overpaid the Medicare HMOs,
the companies say the federal monthly stipend for each enrollee is
not enough to provide extensive benefits. That is especially
problematic in rural areas, where Medicare HMOs cannot enroll
enough members to negotiate discounts with local health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts say, HMOs must focus primarily on urban
markets and must avoid offering generous prescription drug plans,
which can attract a disproportionate number of sickly people.
</P>
<P>
   While Medicare has long been a perilous market for many HMOs, it
may soon get even tougher. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will
reduce the government's Medicare spending by $115 billion over the
next five years. Increases in the monthly stipends the government
pays to HMOs have been sharply reduced, a move that could further
lower operating margins, which have always been thin and now hover
around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies receive some $5,688 annually on average
for each of their Medicare patients, according to the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam's stipend comes with strings attached. The HMOs
usually agree to provide more benefits than traditional Medicare
does _ allowances for prescription drugs, hearing aids and
eyeglasses. And they accept the premise that they can make profits
by controlling costs better than the government can.
</P>
<P>
   A key to a healthy bottom line is to avoid a large percentage of
sick patients, which can quickly devour revenues. The odds appear
to be in the Medicare health maintenance organizations' favor: 90
percent of all Medicare enrollees are generally healthy and require
only about $1,200 on average from the government each year for
medical bills, according to the Urban Institute's analysis of the
1996 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the latest figures
available.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the analysis found, the remaining 10 percent, who
are sick, cost Medicare some $37,000 a year each.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that in metropolitan markets with several
competing Medicare plans, HMOs used prescription drug benefits to
entice elderly members and ended up subsidizing lofty prescription
drug bills. Moreover, the HMOs can end their exposure to ailing
members only by leaving a county altogether, not by dropping
coverage of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Humana and Pacificare have hedged the likelihood of losses by
contracting with doctors to accept a fixed monthly payment for each
member, regardless how much medical care that person may need. The
policy, called capitation, pushes the financial risk onto the
doctor to keep medical costs down.
</P>
<P>
   Humana had 60 percent of its Medicare members in capitation
arrangements at the end of the second quarter, aiming to increase
the figure to 70 percent by the end of the year. Capitation paid
the company big dividends. Revenues from Medicare HMOs accounted
for half of the total earnings at Humana last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitation is a great way to share the risk and to control
costs,'' said Arun Kumar, a director at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``It
works best with populations who are sophisticated about managed
care. You see a lot of capitation on the West Coast. It's unlikely
to be used on the East Coast, partly because there are a large
number of specialists who don't want to share the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To be profitable with their Medicare plans, HMOs may have little
choice but to establish capitation policies wherever they can.
Before the Balanced Budget Act, it was common for the government to
give HMOs annual stipend increases of 10 percent in some counties,
a sum that many complained was too little. The increase has now
been reduced to about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With a rise that slim _ it is less than half the national
medical cost inflation rate _ some HMOs will have to renegotiate
rates with health care providers. But the industry has other
troubles. Although the Balanced Budget Act gradually raises the
stipend HMOs receive for rural counties, critics doubt that the
increase will be enough. Rural areas often have only one hospital,
which has no incentive to lower its rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some rural areas, there is just not enough of a premium to
cover the costs,'' said Lee Newcomer, medical director at United
Healthcare. ``A lot of people who live in a rural area drive into
the city for medical treatment. They incur a city cost while we get
paid the rural premium.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have also struggled to control their administration fees.
Medicare plans, which must be sold in person, are more expensive
than traditional commercial accounts, which may be pitched by
telephone. Elderly people like to meet with company
representatives, and they prefer seeing the plans' benefits and
costs displayed in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that to survive, Medicare HMOs must cut back on
benefits, a process that has riled consumers. According to
Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein, most HMOs are giving each
Medicare enrollee $1,000 in benefits beyond basic hospital coverage
but can afford only $750.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks have already begun, and the most expensive perks
are the first to go. In nearly every market where HMOs have slashed
their offerings, this has has meant tossing out the prescription
drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed up for Secure Horizons because they had a good
prescription drug plan,'' said Hollie Vinson, 43, who is disabled
and lives in Chico, Calif. ``Shortly after that, they discontinued
the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to go out and get my own drug plan,'' she added,
``and it costs more than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons, Ms. Vinson's Medicare HMO, is a unit of
Pacificare, one of California's biggest managed-care companies.
Pacificare's cuts went a lot further elsewhere: The company ended
its Medicare coverage in Utah and in parts of Washington and Oregon
because of thin operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   Market woes are so severe that experts wonder if any Medicare
HMO can prosper indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say a financially sound Medicare HMO may be a
horror to its members. Opponents of capitation contend that the
policy prompts too many doctors to choose costs over sound health
care, saving nickels by canceling tests that are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts question the effectiveness of the government's efforts
to lure more people into managed care. Under the Balanced Budget
Act, those 65 and over can sign up beginning next year for
preferred provider organizations, a network of doctors and
hospitals that accepts government payments for Medicare patients,
or for a provider-sponsored organization, a network that is usually
owned by the providers.
</P>
<P>
   These plans could help Medicare HMOs by introducing more elderly
people to managed care. But an efficient provider-sponsored group
can also steal healthy members from a Medicare HMO in its county.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few providers are offering one of the new plans, leaving
many experts to question their viability.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say these new plans could be slow sellers,
given the snail's pace at which Americans have embraced Medicare
HMOs. Thirteen states have no Medicare HMO plans at all, and even
areas that have usually welcomed new types of health care remain
stubbornly suspicious. Arizona and California have among the
highest percentages of Medicare enrollment, at 39 percent each, but
only 18 percent of New York's 2.6 million Medicare members are
enrolled in HMOs and the penetration in Wisconsin is only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving HMO companies the opportunity to offer more Medicare
plans is only going to make matters worse,'' said Bonnie Burns, a
health care consultant in Scotts Valley, Calif. ``They will keep
the plans that are in profitable areas and drop the others that are
not. Some people in some cities will have six plans while people in
other cities will have none.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time he began playing baseball as an 8-year-old in
Claremont, Calif., Mark McGwire has been a reluctant home run
hitter and a reluctant hero. McGwire wanted to be a pitcher, not a
hitter, and he remained on the mound until college. He has always
wanted to avoid being the primary focus in a team sport.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how reluctant McGwire is to be the slugger in the
spotlight, his thunderous swings produce the sort of prodigious
home runs that have turned him into a larger-than-life figure.
Every fan loves watching baseballs rocket out of stadiums, so every
fan has reveled in McGwire's prowess as he has slipped into his
crouch, uncoiled and crushed another pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Especially this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's captivating run to history culminated Tuesday night
when he belted his 62nd homer to eclipse Roger Maris' hallowed
37-year-old record for the most in one season. McGwire, whose
reluctance abated as he glided toward this moment, broke the record
in the St. Louis Cardinals' 145th game. He instantly became the
most successful home run hitter for one season and a modern
baseball hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed of being in this position,'' the 34-year-old
McGwire said last month. ``I dreamed about being a big leaguer.
Things happen for a reason. Hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the people who watched McGwire develop from a robust
teen-ager who played golf and soccer before baseball, and they
inevitably discuss his work habits. Although his tantalizing story
sometimes seems predestined _ he homered in his first at bat for
the Claremont Little League Athletics _ McGwire did not wake up as
a 17-year-old with a 90-mile-an-hour fastball and a mighty
uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carroll, who coached McGwire at Damien High School in La
Verne, Calif., has a vision of him that swims in his mind. It is
McGwire on the field or in the dugout with his red hair drenched,
his face sweating. That is how McGwire always looked to Carroll:
working or poised to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was not afraid to work,'' Carroll said. ``God gave him
talent, but he worked hard, and that set him apart. God gives
everyone talents. Mark did something with his.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark David McGwire, born Oct. 1, 1963, was the second oldest in
a sports-oriented family of five boys whose cul-de-sac was a field
for all seasons. When he was 5, he caddied for his father, John,
and became intrigued by golf. But John McGwire, a dentist, and his
wife, Ginger, did not allow Mark and Dan, the younger brother who
went on to play quarterback for the Seahawks and the Dolphins, to
become egocentric about sports.
</P>
<P>
   John McGwire never told Mark about the coaches who predicted a
major league career for him, and Ginger believed that Mark never
became adversely affected by success because he was schooled to
respect others. He disliked receiving extra attention, and even
last month McGwire said: ``I don't know anyone who plays this game
to get the attention. I know I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Dedeaux, McGwire's baseball coach at the University of
Southern California, recalled how the burly young man was a
``natural leader'' through his quiet, blue-collar approach. When
McGwire first arrived at Southern Cal, he filled out a form for the
media guide and left the section about athletic accomplishments
blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very unselfish, very disciplined and was a great
teammate, and that comes from having wonderful parents,'' Dedeaux
said. ``You learn all of that from your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire learned even more. His career has been hampered by foot
and back injuries, and he pondered retirement after a 1991 season
in which he batted .201. But then McGwire thought about his
father's lifelong fight. John McGwire learned as a 7-year-old that
he had polio, and he walks with a cane because one of his legs is
much shorter than the other. Now, at 61, he is an avid golfer and
cyclist, once biking 400 miles from San Francisco to Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   How could he quit, Mark reasoned, if his father never did?
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone, McGwire has had his share of problems. He
underwent therapy for four years because, he said, he was an
emotional wreck after his baseball struggles in 1991. He faltered
as a husband, was divorced after four years of marriage and has
said he wishes he could do it all over. He is immersed in
controversy for using androstenedione, a testosterone-inducing
supplement that is legal in baseball but banned in professional
football and the Olympics. He was once asked if he is near-sighted
or far-sighted and he responded, ``blind.'' Without contact lenses,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire is a devoted father to Matthew, his 10-year old son
whose pictures line his locker and who has been a bat boy during
the home run chase. He gives $1 million a year from his three-year,
$28.5 million contract with St. Louis to charities for physically
and sexually abused children. And he is one of the most popular
players of his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people love him so much that he can't go anywhere or do
anything,'' said Pat Kelly, a teammate. ``Everybody wants a piece
of him. At dinner, at a movie. The guy gets mobbed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos drafted McGwire in the eighth round out of
Damien High in 1981 but offered him a signing bonus of only $8,500.
So he accepted a baseball scholarship to Southern Cal with an eye
toward becoming a major league pitcher. By his sophomore year,
McGwire wanted to play first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see the balls jumping off the bat every day in
batting practice,'' Dedeaux said. ``You didn't have to see a game
to realize he had to play a real position. When you saw him hit the
ball nine miles, that was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Southern Cal, McGwire met Kathy, one of the bat girls,
and they married in 1984. The Oakland Athletics drafted McGwire in
the first round that year, signing him for $125,000, and he
catapulted to stardom in 1987 by bashing a rookie record of 49
homers. McGwire had the chance for a 50th on the final day of the
season, but he left the A's in Chicago to return to California to
be with his wife as she gave birth to Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a tough decision to make,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the A's trampled opponents while winning 104 games and
were favored to win the World Series, but they lost to Kirk Gibson
and the Dodgers. It was also a difficult personal year for McGwire,
who went through a divorce. He and his ex-wife share custody of
Matthew, who lives in California with his mother and stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire played in two more World Series with the A's, winning
one from San Francisco in the earthquake-interrupted series of 1989
and losing to the Reds in 1990. After a dreary 1991, McGwire
rebounded with 42 homers in 1992 and then missed virtually all of
1993 and 1994 because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 39 homers in 1995, erupted for 52 in 1996 and had 34
by July 31 in 1997, but the rebuilding A's traded him to St. Louis
instead of trying to re-sign him. He left having hit 363 homers for
the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have underachieved this season, but McGwire's
pursuit of Maris helped rekindle interest in the sport and helped
recapture a legion of fans. Reluctant hero or not, McGwire's
fantasy season will be remembered as one of the best and the most
exciting in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like apple pie,'' McGwire said. ``Every child, boy or
girl, has picked up a ball, a bat or a glove. Everybody can relate
to this sport. That's why I think all Americans can relate to this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And, now, to Mark McGwire and his new home run record.

GORE COMBINES SCHOOL APPEARANCE, POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDEN, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore went on the road Tuesday
to sell the Clinton administration's proposals for hiring more
teachers, building new schools and renovating old ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of a series of town hall meetings that he plans to
hold nearly weekly through the fall, Gore flew into this
hard-pressed former factory town and went to Lincoln Middle School
_ where one-fourth of the 800 students have to be taught in a
double-wide trailer or at the high school across the street _ to
lead a discussion on crowding.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the state of the area's politics, as much as of its
schools, that appeared to lure Gore: The trip provided first-term
Rep. Jim Maloney, D-Conn., who faces a difficult race for
re-election this fall, the opportunity to make a campaign
appearance with him. Gore's aides said that each of the town-hall
discussions he has planned for this fall would be paired with a
political stop.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is viewed in some quarters as a safer choice
to campaign for Democratic candidates than is Clinton, who has been
shunned by some in his party because of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made no direct reference Tuesday to the president's
troubles, and took no questions. But in his remarks at a
fund-raising luncheon with Maloney, he alluded to the fears of
Democratic leaders that the party's voters would stay home in
November because of disillusionment caused by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declared that the Republican right wing was ``willing to
work hard for a bunch of crazy ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They work at it,'' he said, ``and as a result they sometimes
win elections which by all rights they have no business winning.
And so the question comes down to this: Are you willing to match
their intensity with even more of your own?''

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 13,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HAPPINESS-FILM (Undated) _ At a time when the news media are
awash in the gory details of presidential sexual hijinks, the
public is supposedly beyond shock when it comes to revelations of
bad behavior. Or is it? The acid test will come with the first
public American screenings of Todd Solondz's pitch-black comedy
``Happiness,'' at the New York Film Festival. ``Happiness,'' which
will be released in theaters on Oct. 16 by Good Machine, is a
gleeful, systematic demolition of the myth of the suburban idyll.
By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN-MYERS-FILMS (Undated) _ Once upon a time, the talk was
of the It Girl. These days, Jonathan Rhys Meyers has filmmakers
extolling what one might call the A Boy. The A, of course, stands
for androgynous, which is one quality _ an infectious smile and raw
talent are others _ that has the 21-year-old Irishman leading the
latest Anglo-Irish thespian wave. ``Johnny's fabulous to look at,''
said Ang Lee, who cast Rhys Meyers as a long-haired
villain-with-a-difference in his Civil War film, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' which is expected to be released in the spring,
co-starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NIVOLA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Few actors, however successful, can
say that they have a museum in the family, but Alessandro Nivola,
26, can boast of two: one, devoted to his grandfather, the Italian
sculptor Constantino Nivola, is situated in the artist's hometown
in Sardinia, and a second, a far more modest and decidedly
unofficial archive in Manhattan, is devoted to the actor himself.
In his next movie, ``Best Laid Plans,'' a drama starring Reese
Witherspoon and Josh Brolin that is to be released next spring, he
plays a graduate student turned con artist, and in ``I Want You,''
a forthcoming British film by Michael Winterbottom that is set in
the seaside town of Hastings, Nivola plays a paroled murderer
seeking to rekindle a forbidden love affair _ a role he researched
by spending three days in Brixton prison in South London. By
Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-ACTION-FILM (Boston) _ Nonfiction books and films always
dance cheek to cheek with real life, of course. But ``A Civil
Action,'' a Disney movie that is to open on Dec. 25, based on the
acclaimed 1995 book by Jonathan Harr, has an unusually, uncannily
intimate relationship with reality. Perhaps the most intriguing
aspect of the success of the book and potential success of the
movie is this: In their depiction of a cluster of leukemia deaths
among children in the Boston suburb of Woburn and the large-scale
1986 legal battle that ensued over whether industrial pollution was
to blame, the reality they convey is not a comfortable or a simple
one. By Carey Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SAM-ROCKWELL-FILMS (Undated) _ Sam Rockwell is a master of the
quick change. The 29-year-old actor showed his range in January at
the Sundance Film Festival, where he was featured in not one but
three films. He appeared as the romantic, James Dean-like outcast
who mows lawns in John Duigan's ``Lawn Dogs,'' which opened in May;
he slouched across the screen as a hilariously inept safecracker in
John Hamburg's ``Safe Men,'' which opened in July, and he delivered
a chilling performance as a car-salesman-turned-hitman in Saul
Rubinek's dark comedy ``Jerry and Tom,'' which will also be shown
this month at the Toronto Film Festival. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON (New York) _ There are a few things I am looking
forward to this season with the sort of hopes that are usually
dangerous. These are centered on three actors who, though none have
been on Broadway recently, arrive with sterling pedigrees and in
roles that would seem to fit them like wet suits. Martin Short, the
comedian of a thousand professional alter-egos, will appropriately
be playing not one but a number of roles in the Roundabout Theater
Company's revival of the 1962 musical ``Little Me'' this fall. Judi
Dench, the great English actress who recently won American hearts
as a startlingly human Queen Victoria in the movie ``Mrs. Brown,''
returns to New York this spring in David Hare's London hit ``Amy's
View.'' And Kevin Spacey, the Academy- and Tony Award-winning actor
who defies the casting director's notions of ``type,'' is also due
this spring as Eugene O'Neill's dream-smashing salesman in ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' a role he played to feverish acclaim in London. By
Ben Brantley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ Boris Eifman's choreography, like his
dancers, is passionate and intense: his Eifman Ballet of St.
Petersburg gave audiences a jolt when this 21-year-old Russian
troupe made its New York debut in April with provocative
psychodramas about Tchaikovsky and the ballerina Olga Spessivtseva.
When the Eifman Ballet returns to City Center Jan. 19 through 31,
it will be easier to see why Eifman's highly expressive use of the
ballet idiom is so dramatic and stunning. ``The Karamazovs,'' his
two-act treatment of Dostoyevsky's ``Brothers Karamazov'' is a
distilled if graphic essay on the novel's themes. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SERIES-SEASON (New York) _ Many of us in New York complain
yearly about pandering repertory and incoherent programs, but
solutions are arriving from every side. I hope the public responds,
because music this season is being served with a sense of adventure
unusual to the decade. The watchword is ``series,'' and there are a
lot of them: coherent looks at either individuals or ideas. By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MORISSETTE-ALBUM (Undated) _ The aftershocks from Alanis
Morissette's ``Jagged Little Pill'' haven't subsided since the
album was released in 1995. In one pop-culture masterstroke, the
album introduced a mainstream audience to what punks, post-punks,
riot grrrls and alternative rockers had been shouting for more than
a decade: that women were angry, intelligent, carnal, sick of being
victims and ready to speak for themselves. Ms. Morissette's new
album is due for release on Nov. 3, and advance information is
scarce; she has not even revealed the album's title. By Jon
Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTS-SEASON (Undated) _ Money, movies, missiles, malls and
madness: the time approaches when these may be the only first-rate
items the United States will continue to turn out for international
consumption. There will be nothing but one vast continental sprawl
anchored by two buildings, one on either coast: the Pentagon, and
the new theater for the Academy Awards on Hollywood Boulevard,
which breaks ground this fall. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-MONET-ART (Undated) _ How specifically ``American'' were
Jackson Pollock's pictures? It's fitting that two of the big shows
this fall are the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York City in November and the late Monet show at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston this month. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-ASIAN-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Forget that books are
endangered by the computer and that Asian art is collected mostly
by Asians. Both are on the minds of the nation's curators, who have
assembled some of the strongest and most diverse selections of such
works ever shown in this country. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BESTSELLERS (Undated) (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   PAPERBACKS (Undated) (Moved.)

<P>
   TRAVEL (`t' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-EUROPE-SEASON (London) _ A new train to the plane is a

   ST. LOUIS _ Just keep belting the ball out of the park, early
and often. This was the way to exorcise all the ghosts and the
shadows, the doubts and the quibbles, the parenthetical clauses and
the modifying phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has politely kept Babe Ruth and Roger Maris on
their pedestals, but he caught them quickly, before anybody could
drag out charts and theories to diminish what the big boy has done.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night against the Cubs, McGwire, in his second at-bat,
hit his 62nd homer in his team's 145th game _ giving him more
homers in a season than anybody who ever played major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say they put an asterisk on it,'' McGwire said
after launching No. 61 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before McGwire crushed another. And
in a way, that took away from the drama. There has been no autumnal
chill, no pennant-race jitters, no sense of urgency, not like the
haunted Maris trudging around the bases with his head half down in
the Oct. 1 shadows of Yankee Stadium, doing it on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   After stultifying heat and humidity on the Labor Day weekend,
there was finally a brisk September feel to Busch Stadium Tuesday
night, but until now McGwire and his buddy Sammy Sosa have been
playing in an endless summer. Impervious to major slump or serious
injury or pressure, McGwire made it easier for himself by roaring
past 50, hitting 60 and setting his sights on 70. That's the way to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Roger Maris hit 61 homers in 162 Yankee games in
1961, and Babe Ruth hit 60 homers in 154 Yankee games in 1927, when
the schedule went to only 154 games. Sosa, the laughing cavalier,
went into last night's game with 58 homers in the Cubs' first 144
games.
</P>
<P>
   These were remarkable performances by both McGwire and Sosa,
that cannot be even partly diminished by citing friendly ball
parks, expansion pitching, helpful supplements, weight machines and
jet-age balls.
</P>
<P>
   These two men, along with Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle, who went
into Tuesday with 50 home runs, are the next generation of
world-level athlete: McGwire, bulked up at 34 but more agile than
he was in his 20s; Sosa, powerful and compact; and Griffey, lithe
and airborne, pulling home runs back over the fences on defense,
laughing his way past the weight room and the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flicker of an asterisk a few weeks back when an
astute reporter noticed, in plain sight, a container of
androstenedione in McGwire's locker. The slugger admitted he was
using the over-the-counter substance to help build his body, but
baseball had no rule against the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   In taking androstenedione, McGwire has done nothing illegal _
dangerous, maybe, but not illegal. With his eye, with his hands,
with his acquired hitter's reflexes, he has deflected even a
potential symbolic asterisk, unlike poor Maris in 1961, the first
year of the 162-game schedule. Commissioner Ford C. Frick, formerly
Babe Ruth's ghost writer, tagged a mostly unseen asterisk on Maris,
who had 59 homers through the first 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great admirer of Ford Frick,'' said the new
commissioner, Bud Selig, ``but that was not one of his greatest
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has cited the sentiments for Ruth and Mickey Mantle
during Maris' bittersweet year: ``You have two strikes against you
in the huge city of New York. I mean, that is not good. There
again, there are people being negative out there that just didn't
want to see somebody do history. The fact is, he did it. The fact
is that everybody should be happy for Roger Maris and his family.
Records are meant to be broken. It just happens that we are close
to it right now, and it is going to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McGwire said of Maris: ``It was not fair to criticize
him. Is it his fault that he played when they changed it to 162
games?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris Jr. has watched the home run derby of 1998 with a
twinge of sadness. ``Everybody knows who Mark McGwire is,'' he
said. ``Everyone is pulling for Mark McGwire and they want to see
him do this and I think that would be just an outstanding feeling
for my father. And, yeah, I wished that would have happened for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Roger Maris felt saddled with an asterisk, for all
time. By crushing so many home runs, so early, McGwire and Sosa are
knocking the asterisk out of the ball park.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ As the pilots of Swissair Flight 111 were
struggling to prepare their jumbo jet for an emergency landing last
Wednesday night, a series of vital operating systems on the plane
were gradually breaking down, the chief investigator said on
Tuesday evening after a preliminary examination of the plane's
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, on Tuesday, investigators also released a full
transcript of conversations between air traffic controllers and the
pilots, who were simultaneously striving to locate the source of
smoke streaming into their cockpit and to prepare for an unexpected
approach to an unfamiliar airport in a plane brimming with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the conversations are largely calm and technical, at
least a touch of frantic confusion occasionally slipped in. At one
point, the pilots broadcast a conversation between the two of them,
in German, to a puzzled air controller on the ground, and, at
another point, both decided to talk to the controller at once.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, investigators said that they had recovered
parts from the cockpit that showed signs of heat damage. The pilots
had reported smoke in the cockpit at the beginning of the incident,
but it is not clear yet whether there was a fire there.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still hoping to recover the other ``black
box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, but rough weather kept divers
out of the water on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with enough analysis, said the chief investigator, Vic
Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, the details from
the box that Canadian navy divers brought up on Sunday may reveal
where the plane's problem began, even though the recorder quit six
minutes before the plane crashed five miles off the coast near
here.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said that investigators in his data-processing laboratory
in Ottawa were working backwards from the end of the data and had
not yet determined where on the 25-hour record (a period that could
cover three previous flights) the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said that they did not want to say more about the
information from the flight data recorder until they had time to
assess its meaning and integrate the information with radar tapes
and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But another indication of the plane's growing distress came from
the tape of conversations between the controllers and the pilots.
Investigators said that they could hear in the background at one
point the warbling warning sound that the plane's autopilot makes
when it disconnects itself. If an autopilot cannot follow its
instructions, be they for altitude, speed, heading, or pitch, it
flips itself off and lets the pilots know it has done so.
Investigators say they do not yet know which failure made the
autopilot quit.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript of communications between the Geneva-bound jet
and air traffic controllers shows some confusion on both sides of
the conversation, although it was not immediately evident if the
errors made any difference to the outcome of the flight. All 229
people on the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the air traffic control communications that was
released on Tuesday begins with the pilots, about half an hour out
of Kennedy International Airport in New York, using standard
language to introduce the aircraft to a controller at a
high-altitude control center in Moncton, New Brunswick, as Swissair
one-eleven heavy. (Heavy means any plane over 300,000 pounds, and
warns the controller not to put a following plane in the heavy
plane's wake.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Everything proceeds normally until one of the pilots says the
flight is ``declaring Pan Pan Pan,'' sign of an urgent problem,
about 10:14 p.m. local time. The pilot _ no one knows yet if it was
the captain or the first officer _ says he wants to go to ``a
convenient place, I guess Boston.'' Controllers limit each altitude
to planes going in a single direction, and the controller clears
the Swissair flight to descend from 33,000 feet to 31,000, an
altitude appropriate for traffic headed to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty seconds after Swissair's initial call, the controller,
with a much better idea of the MD-11's location, says, ``Uh, would
you prefer to go into Halifax,'' which is about as close to an
order as an air traffic controller gives a plane in trouble, and
thirty seconds later, Swissair accepts the suggestion.
``Speedbird,'' a call sign for a supersonic Concorde, is listening
in, and the British Air crew supplies Swissair with weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid what is undoubtedly a very heavy workload in the cockpit,
the Swissair pilot has to ask twice for the wind direction and the
radio frequency for the instrument landing system at Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   An open question for investigators is whether the plane could
have begun dumping fuel earlier, to get the plane's weight down to
the recommended maximum for landing, or should have bothered
dumping at all, if it delayed a landing. In Canada, Gerden said on
Tuesday evening, planes may dump fuel if they are above 2,000 feet
above ground level, and the plane need not have circled the water
to do this.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of apparent miscommunication, the pilot gets an
answer, but not to his question. When the pilot asks, ``We, uh,
must dump some fuel. May we do that in this area during descent?''
the controller does not immediately answer, but asks if the plane
can turn left or right for a previously-discussed circle to lose
altitude. The pilot says, ``we are able for a left or right turn
towards the south to dump,'' a course that will take them out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The controller tells them they will be over the coast in 10
miles, and that they should advise him when they are ready to dump.
The pilot does not say he is beginning dumping until almost three
minutes later, at which time the controller tells him, ``Just a
couple of miles I'll be right with you,'' and thirty seconds after
that, the controller tells the crew to begin dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling moment is when a pilot has evidently keyed the
microphone for transmission to the ground while discussing with the
other pilot, in German, whether they are performing the emergency
checklist for smoke, a confusion equivalent to trying to carry on
two telephone conversations simultaneously and putting the wrong
one on hold.
</P>
<P>
   While they were conducting these communications with the ground,
the crew had a choice of detailed checklists for dealing with
smoke. The procedure they discussed among themselves was for smoke
from an air-conditioning system, and the procedure is to increase
the airflow rate to maximum. If that does not help, the crew is
supposed to turn off one air-conditioning pack and run the other,
and if that does not solve the problem, reverse the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   For removing smoke of unknown origin, the procedure is to turn
off the galley equipment, and if that does not help, rotate a
switch to turn off one third of the plane's circuits at a time.
</P>
<P>
   To remove fumes from a cockpit, the procedure is to increase
ventilation, descend to 12,000 feet, slow down and depressurize the
aircraft. Then the pilots are supposed to open one of their two
cockpit windows. In the MD-11 cockpit, those slide sideways on a
track, and are big enough for a pilot to crawl through, as happened
in an accident last year at Newark International Airport in which a
plane flipped upside down on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the instructions are to land at the nearest suitable
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder, whose pings were still heard on
Tuesday, is likely to give investigators more information on the
plane's condition. And the cockpit itself is a crucial goal for the
investigators. They are expecting the arrival of the U.S. Navy
salvage ship Grapple on Wednesday; a veteran of the TWA 800
recovery effort, it should begin work later this week.

RENO ORDERS 90-DAY INQUIRY INTO WHETHER CAMPAIGN ADS ILLEGALLY
AIDED CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Incorporates previous copy; subs top for rewriting)   (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advancing a pivotal step toward the possible
appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate campaign
finance abuses, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day
inquiry on Tuesday into whether President Clinton circumvented
federal election laws in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision marked the third time in less than two weeks
that the Justice Department has begun a 90-day independent-counsel
inquiry into allegations of possible election improprieties _ this
one into whether Clinton illegally benefited from Democratic
advertisements during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other two investigations, this one named Clinton
as the subject of the inquiry, and is potentially the most
far-reaching because it goes to the heart of the Democrats'
fund-raising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the three-judge panel that supervises
independent counsel matters, Reno said that she had begun a
preliminary investigation ``involving President of the United
States William Jefferson Clinton concerning political
advertisements during the 1996 election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The new inquiry centers on whether Clinton and White House aides
coordinated an advertising campaign to benefit Clinton's
re-election, in an improper effort to violate federal spending
limits that he agreed to follow when he accepted taxpayer financing
for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno initiated the 90-day review based on the preliminary
findings of an Federal Election Commission audit last month. The
audit concluded that the Democratic National Committee evaded
federal spending limits by funneling $42 million dollars to state
parties for ads that were thinly-veiled messages on behalf of the
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. The audit determined that the
ads, commonly called issue ads, should have been counted under
spending limits imposed on the president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other two outstanding inquiries focus on Vice President Al
Gore's statements about his telephone fund-raising calls and on
possible perjury by Harold Ickes, a former deputy White House chief
of staff, concerning his dealings with the Teamsters union. By the
end of the 90-day period for each investigation, Reno is required
by law to decide whether to seek the appointment of an outside
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said on Tuesday that the
Democrats' ads were lawful. ``Each Clinton-Gore ad was reviewed by
counsel at the president's request, to assure the ad's legality,
and approved prior to broadcast,'' he said. ``When the Department
of Justice's review process finally concludes, it will determine
that the Clinton-Gore ads were entirely proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sandler, the general counsel for the Democratic National
Committee, said the ads were legal and no different in tone than
ads financed by Republicans for their party. ``We expect that this
fuller examination will demonstrate conclusively that the DNC
followed the letter and spirit of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has reviewed the legality of the issue ads on at least
three separate occasions over the last two years, but each time
went no further than a 30-day initial review of the allegations,
which were first raised in late 1996 by Common Cause, the public
interest group.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, Reno found no wrongdoing, saying she lacked
specific and credible of evidence that a crime had been committed
by any of the high-level officials, like the president, who are
covered by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that the audit report
provided few new facts about the conduct of Clinton or any other
official but was highly significant in persuading Reno to launch
the inquiry. The agency's audit marked the first time that the
Federal Election Commission investigators had ever questioned the
legality of the content of the ads in a manner that allowed the
Justice Department to assert its criminal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some government officials, including those who favor an
independent prosecutor, said that it could be difficult to define a
specific prosecutable offense in this area. And they added,
Clinton's campaign embarked on the issue ads on the basis of
extensive legal advice that the activities were legal _ a
potentially strong defense that could quickly thwart any effort to
consider a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In her action on Tuesday, Reno moved to a stage of deliberations
that could lead her to seek the appointment of an independent
prosecutor. Her decision on Tuesday gives the Justice Department
three months to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to
believe that Clinton broke the law. If so, Reno has no choice but
to refer the case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly nervous in recent days, Democrats have expressed
fears about what an investigation of the issue ads might mean. An
independent counsel investigation of Clinton's role in the
advertisements, which were a central thrust of the president's
campaign, could evolve into exactly the kind of wide-ranging
criminal inquiry that Republican lawmakers have demanded from the
outset and which, thus far, Reno has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Reno has seemed willing to reconsider her
position, based on what her aides said was newly unearthed
information or in the case of the issue ads, information that was
recently provided by another agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her Republican critics suggested that the attorney
general had reversed herself because of an outcry after Charles La
Bella, the former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance
unit, sent her a report urging her to seek the appointment of an
independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said Reno's action was a positive, but incomplete step.
``Until we have a broad-based independent counsel investigation, we
will only be looking at the loose threads of the scandal and not
the most serious alleged violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, which investigated campaign finance issues last
year, said Reno should ask the three-judge panel to appoint an
independent prosecutor immediately. ``While it appears the attorney
general is inching toward doing what she should've done almost two
years ago, there is no reason to take another 90 days to further
belabor the obvious,'' he said.

 &HT;    Mark McGwire: A profile
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire is physically imposing _ 6 feet 5, 250
pounds, with huge hands, a large trunk and powerful arms. Add the
scruffy red beard and the fact that he doesn't smile a lot, and
it's easy to imagine McGwire as a major-league baseball ruffian.
</P>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's sensitive side has caused his emotions to overflow on
numerous occasions during his historic chase. He cries when he
talks about family. He cries when he talks about Babe Ruth and
Roger Maris. He cries when he talks about the St. Louis fans, who
welcomed him with open arms last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people know now is just how great a guy he is,''
said Mike Shannon, a Cardinals announcer and former player. ``He is
so genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see with Mark is what you get,'' teammate Ron Gant
said. ``There is no show there, no trying to say and do the right
things. As soon as he came over here, we all knew how he would fit
in. He's like a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire might be the most modest of all sports heroes. While
Michael Jordan constantly sells himself off the court and
appreciates the limelight, McGwire would rather sit at home with
his 10-year-old son, Matt. McGwire, nicknamed Big Mac, has turned
his back on most endorsements, most notably McDonald's, which would
be a natural fit. McGwire doesn't eat the sandwich, and he thinks
it would be hypocritical to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire gives $1 million a year to the cause of abused children
and constantly participates in public-service advertisements. He
was doing just that on Thursday, when the Cardinals had one of
their rare off days. Most players involved in such a
pressure-cooker probably would have relaxed at home.
</P>
<P>
   He is extremely close to his son, who often serves as the
Cardinals' batboy. McGwire's contract stipulates that his son can
travel with the Cardinals any time he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk all the time,'' McGwire told Sports Illustrated. ``We
talk about everything. If there's one thing I have learned, you
have to talk. We talk so much that sometimes we don't even use
words. We just look at each other and know what the other is
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is divorced from Matt's mother, Kathy, and Matt does not
live with his father. But in the offseason, Mark returns to his
home in Orange County, Calif., five minutes from his son. In fact,
McGwire has become good friends with his ex-wife's new husband, Tom
Williamson, and on many days in the offseason Mark, Tom and Matt
can be seen together on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `How do you compete with a guy like that?'
Williamson told Sports Illustrated. ``I always answer, `You don't.'
I don't have to. Mark's such a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also has been a great ambassador for baseball. He gives
away jerseys, caps and gloves. When he goes into each town, he
spends time signing for players from the other clubhouse. When he
was in Atlanta last month, he faced a roomful of memorabilia to
sign. He signed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is always asking Mark for stuff,'' Gant said.
``That's just the nature of this business. If you play for the
Cardinals, people ask you, `Can you get McGwire to sign something?'
He always does it.''
</P>
<P>
   And this city loves him for it. Not since the days of Stan
Musial has St. Louis adored a player as much as it does McGwire. He
probably will finish his career here, after signing a new contract
before the season. Even Musial looks up to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been great for this city,'' said Musial, who spends a
lot of time at the ballpark. ``What he has done for St. Louis and
the rest of this country has been incredible. And he hasn't changed
at all through it. Years from now, people will talk about Mark
being one of the greatest.''

 &HT;    After long-running battle with Sosa, McGwire finally won race to
62
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The chase is over: Someone finally hit 62.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven seasons after Roger Maris passed Babe Ruth, Mark
McGwire is the new single-season home run king.
</P>
<P>
   In a magical season that transfixed baseball, McGwire started
fast, then found himself in a home-run duel with Sammy Sosa, before
finally claiming the stage for himself.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's magic homer came Tuesday, one day after he tied the
record. Now he looks to set his own standard. Could it be 65, or
even 70?
</P>
<P>
   But first, a look back.
</P>
<P>
   The homer on Monday that tied Maris was almost as special as the
one that broke the record. It was a blistering first-inning shot
off Cubs veteran Mike Morgan that crashed off the restaurant window
just inside the left-field pole and landed some 430 feet from the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary baseball voice Jack Buck, the Cardinals' radio
announcer, made the call:
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing and look at there! Look-a there! Look-a there! McGwire's
No. 61! McGwire's Flight 61 headed for Planet Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire hit it, he threw both arms into the air as he
watched the ball land. He rounded first and bumped forearms with
Cubs first baseman Mark Grace and did the same at third with former
teammate Gary Gaetti. Sosa stood in right field, smiling and
clapping. After rounding third, McGwire pointed at the the sky, at
what he calls ``The Man Upstairs,'' then crossed home plate. He
popped on-deck hitter Ray Lankford in the stomach and lifted his
son Mathew, serving as a batboy, and hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't finished. He pointed to the fans, to his father, John,
who had turned 61 that day, and to the family of Maris, thumping
his heart and saying, ``Roger's with me.'' Then he saluted his
team's owners and took a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   In the left-field stands, a 28-year-old catering worker
retrieved the ball. The man, who attended the game only because his
brother-in-law had to work, gave the ball to McGwire without asking
for any money.
</P>
<P>
   With the record-tying homer in the books, the dream became
complete the next night with No. 62. And more than two weeks remain
in the magical season.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   The season opened with McGwire as the focus. He had slugged 58
homers the season before, and many experts and fans thought he
could be the one to break Maris' record, especially in an expansion
year, when pitching would be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't waste any time. On Opening Day, the last day of March,
he hit a grand slam, the first for a Cardinal in a season opener.
At 360 feet, it was not a typical McGwire shot; only three all
season would be shorter.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, no special attention went to Sammy Sosa. The Cubs
rightfielder had hit 36 homers in 1997, and most baseball people
thought that if anyone would chase Maris along with McGwire it
would be Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., who hit 56 homers last season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 10 home runs in April. Three came against the
expansion Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14, the third time in his
career that he had hit three in a game. Eight of his opening-month
homers came with the team tied or behind. His 32 RBIs in April tied
the NL record set by Barry Bonds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's first homer came on April 4, one of six for the month.
Griffey hit 10. The race was on.
</P>
<P>
   A BIG MAC MAY
</P>
<P>
   McGwire kept turning heads in May. His 545-foot home run on May
16 against the Marlins was the longest ever hit at Busch Stadium in
St. Louis. The next night they put a giant Band-Aid over the dent
in the sign in center field. ``That was the best ball I've ever
hit,'' McGwire said. ``I don't think I could have hit it better.''
Marlins coach Rich Donnelly said, ``I saw people in the upper deck
ducking.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also hit his 400th career homer, becoming the fastest of
26 players to reach that milestone. He went deep eight times in
seven days, hit 16 homers in the month and finished May with 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa continued to hit homers on his usual pace. His seven in May
gave him 13 for the first two months but left him 14 behind
McGwire. Griffey had 18.
</P>
<P>
   As in the season before, it was McGwire and Griffey. But Sosa
was about to get hot. Very hot.
</P>
<P>
   HERE COMES SAMMY
</P>
<P>
   McGwire remained consistent in June. On the 27th of the month,
he hit his 36th homer in the club's 79th game. It put him 31 games
ahead of Babe Ruth's pace to 60 in 1927 and 13 games ahead of
Maris' 61 in 1961. McGwire hit another on the 30th, but it would be
his last homer for 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention was growing daily, and the Cardinals set up
special press conferences for McGwire. The strain was beginning to
show, and McGwire refused to answer questions about his homers on
nights that the Cardinals lost.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit two homers on June 2nd after sitting out the previous
three games with a swollen thumb. Then he homered in five straight
games, giving him 11 in his last 10 games and 20 for the season. On
the 15th, he smashed three, and on June 20 he hit his 20th homer in
his last 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa finished with 20 home runs in June, a major-league record
for any month, and drove in 40 runs. He was back in the home-run
chase with 33, just three behind McGwire. But Sosa said, ``It's
McGwire who's going to break the record. He's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also had a good June, hitting 14 to give him 32. It was
a three-man race, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ALL STAR BLUES
</P>
<P>
   In July, baseball wondered how
</P>
<P>
   McGwire would be affected by his failure in the Home Run Derby
at the All-Star Game. With millions watching, he was eliminated in
the first round, and as the second half started, some people
thought it might affect his swing. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first July homer came four days after the game. He hit
two the next day, including his 40th. Five days later, he hit his
42nd, setting a record for the most homers by the end of July,
sending him past Jimmie Foxx and Babe Ruth. McGwire finished July
with 45 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa trailed McGwire by five home runs most of the month. But he
made a run at McGwire beginning on the 28th. After a nine-year
grand slam drought, he hit the first two of his career on
consecutive nights. He finished the month with 42, three behind
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, however, was struggling. He hit just eight in July to
drop out of the race and would get only six in August.
</P>
<P>
   A WILD AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, coming on hard, hit six homers in 11 games. When the Cubs
and Cardinals met on the 8th, McGwire led off the fifth inning with
his 46th of the season, but Sosa later tied the game with his 44th.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11th against the Giants, Sosa actually caught McGwire
with his 46th. But a few innings later, McGwire hit his 47th,
against the Mets, breaking Hack Wilson's record for the most home
runs before Sept. 1. With the Cubs and Cardinals playing on Aug.
19, Sosa tied McGwire again and actually led the race for a few
innings after he hit his 48th. But McGwire came back less then an
hour later and tied him.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20 in New York, McGwire became the first player in
major-league history to connect for 50 or more homers three seasons
in a row. Setting that record and reaching that milestone seemed to
relax McGwire: ``I can eat. I can sleep. I am having a great
time,'' he said. ``I wish everyone could experience what I am going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit his 50th and 51st homers on the 23rd. Three days later
he hit his 52nd, his third-inning homer leaving him two behind
McGwire and giving him a streak of 13 consecutive series with a
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Then McGwire had to face his biggest off-the-field controversy
of the season. He acknowledged that he had been taking
Androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement. Some people said
they thought the drug usage, while legal in baseball, would tarnish
the record if McGwire reached it. But McGwire said, ``Making
something out of nothing -- that has been my statement the whole
time. There are people across America laughing at what the media
has done with this thing. It's absolutely nothing. It's a
supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem for McGwire's home-run total was running into
the Braves. Atlanta pitching had shut down McGwire for most of the
season, and starting on the 27th, he was having problems again. On
the 29th, he was thrown out in the first inning for arguing a
called third strike. Fans at Busch Stadium went crazy, throwing
baseballs and debris on the field and booing for several innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the next night, McGwire started his final assault on Maris.
Against 244-game-winner Dennis Martinez, he drove a 500-foot shot
over the center field wall at Busch. It would be the first of five
homers in his next 12 at-bats. He and Sosa both ended the month at
55.
</P>
<P>
   REACHING MARIS AND BEYOND
</P>
<P>
   McGwire started off September with a pair of two-homer games in
Florida. On the first day of the month, he tied and then broke
Wilson's 68-year-old National League record with this 56th and
57th. On the 2nd, Sosa was able to get within one with a home run
against the Reds, but later that night, McGwire poked two -- to get
within one of Ruth -- and said, ``Quite amazing, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were off the next day, preparing for the holiday
weekend. A television-shopping network offered $250,000 to the fan
catching the record-breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came home for a three-game weekend series against the
Reds. Seats in the left-field bleachers were the hot ticket, with
fans wanting a chance to catch history.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seemed a little tense going into Friday night's game,
canceling his pregame press conference with the media ``to get his
head straight.'' It was a long night. Sosa fared better in
Pittsburgh, hitting his 57th.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was better for Mcwire. In the first inning, he tied
Babe Ruth with No. 60 on a fastball from the Reds' Dennis Reyes and
pulled within one swing of Roger Maris. McGwire spent most of the
postgame news conference talking about Ruth. ``I wish I could go
back in time and meet him,'' he said. ``When I pass away, I want to
meet him and find out what he was really like.'' Later that night
in Pittsburgh, Sosa climbed to No. 58 with a sixth-inning shot off
the Pirates Sean Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, neither went deep, although McGwire came very close,
missing by just 7 feet on a foul ball hit in his third at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, with McGwire and Sosa on the same field,
McGwire would tie Maris and his 37-year-old record.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ As the pilots of Swissair Flight 111 were
struggling to prepare their jumbo jet for an emergency landing last
Wednesday night, a series of vital operating systems on the plane
were gradually breaking down, the chief investigator said on
Tuesday evening after a preliminary examination of the plane's
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, on Tuesday, investigators also released a full
transcript of conversations between air traffic controllers and the
pilots, who were simultaneously striving to locate the source of
smoke streaming into their cockpit and to prepare for an unexpected
approach to an unfamiliar airport in a plane brimming with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the conversations are largely calm and technical, at
least a touch of frantic confusion occasionally slipped in. At one
point, the pilots broadcast a conversation between the two of them,
in German, to a puzzled air controller on the ground, and, at
another point, both decided to talk to the controller at once.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, investigators said that they had recovered
parts from the cockpit that showed signs of heat damage. The pilots
had reported smoke in the cockpit at the beginning of the incident,
but it is not clear yet whether there was a fire there.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still hoping to recover the other ``black
box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, but rough weather kept divers
out of the water on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with enough analysis, said the chief investigator, Vic
Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, the details from
the box that Canadian navy divers brought up on Sunday may reveal
where the plane's problem began, even though the recorder quit six
minutes before the plane crashed five miles off the coast near
here.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said that investigators in his data-processing laboratory
in Ottawa were working backwards from the end of the data and had
not yet determined where on the 25-hour record (a period that could
cover three previous flights) the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said that they did not want to say more about the
information from the flight data recorder until they had time to
assess its meaning and integrate the information with radar tapes
and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But another indication of the plane's growing distress came from
the tape of conversations between the controllers and the pilots.
Investigators said that they could hear in the background at one
point the warbling warning sound that the plane's autopilot makes
when it disconnects itself. If an autopilot cannot follow its
instructions, be they for altitude, speed, heading, or pitch, it
flips itself off and lets the pilots know it has done so.
Investigators say they do not yet know which failure made the
autopilot quit.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript of communications between the Geneva-bound jet
and air traffic controllers shows some confusion on both sides of
the conversation, although it was not immediately evident if the
errors made any difference to the outcome of the flight. All 229
people on the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the air traffic control communications that was
released on Tuesday begins with the pilots, about half an hour out
of Kennedy International Airport in New York, using standard
language to introduce the aircraft to a controller at a
high-altitude control center in Moncton, New Brunswick, as Swissair
one-eleven heavy. (Heavy means any plane over 300,000 pounds, and
warns the controller not to put a following plane in the heavy
plane's wake.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Everything proceeds normally until one of the pilots says the
flight is ``declaring Pan Pan Pan,'' sign of an urgent problem,
about 10:14 p.m. local time. The pilot _ no one knows yet if it was
the captain or the first officer _ says he wants to go to ``a
convenient place, I guess Boston.'' Controllers limit each altitude
to planes going in a single direction, and the controller clears
the Swissair flight to descend from 33,000 feet to 31,000, an
altitude appropriate for traffic headed to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty seconds after Swissair's initial call, the controller,
with a much better idea of the MD-11's location, says, ``Uh, would
you prefer to go into Halifax,'' which is about as close to an
order as an air traffic controller gives a plane in trouble, and
thirty seconds later, Swissair accepts the suggestion.
``Speedbird,'' a call sign for a supersonic Concorde, is listening
in, and the British Air crew supplies Swissair with weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid what is undoubtedly a very heavy workload in the cockpit,
the Swissair pilot has to ask twice for the wind direction and the
radio frequency for the instrument landing system at Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   An open question for investigators is whether the plane could
have begun dumping fuel earlier, to get the plane's weight down to
the recommended maximum for landing, or should have bothered
dumping at all, if it delayed a landing. In Canada, Gerden said on
Tuesday evening, planes may dump fuel if they are above 2,000 feet
above ground level, and the plane need not have circled the water
to do this.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of apparent miscommunication, the pilot gets an
answer, but not to his question. When the pilot asks, ``We, uh,
must dump some fuel. May we do that in this area during descent?''
the controller does not immediately answer, but asks if the plane
can turn left or right for a previously-discussed circle to lose
altitude. The pilot says, ``we are able for a left or right turn
towards the south to dump,'' a course that will take them out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The controller tells them they will be over the coast in 10
miles, and that they should advise him when they are ready to dump.
The pilot does not say he is beginning dumping until almost three
minutes later, at which time the controller tells him, ``Just a
couple of miles I'll be right with you,'' and thirty seconds after
that, the controller tells the crew to begin dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling moment is when a pilot has evidently keyed the
microphone for transmission to the ground while discussing with the
other pilot, in German, whether they are performing the emergency
checklist for smoke, a confusion equivalent to trying to carry on
two telephone conversations simultaneously and putting the wrong
one on hold.
</P>
<P>
   While they were conducting these communications with the ground,
the crew had a choice of detailed checklists for dealing with
smoke. The procedure they discussed among themselves was for smoke
from an air-conditioning system, and the procedure is to increase
the airflow rate to maximum. If that does not help, the crew is
supposed to turn off one air-conditioning pack and run the other,
and if that does not solve the problem, reverse the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   For removing smoke of unknown origin, the procedure is to turn
off the galley equipment, and if that does not help, rotate a
switch to turn off one third of the plane's circuits at a time.
</P>
<P>
   To remove fumes from a cockpit, the procedure is to increase
ventilation, descend to 12,000 feet, slow down and depressurize the
aircraft. Then the pilots are supposed to open one of their two
cockpit windows. In the MD-11 cockpit, those slide sideways on a
track, and are big enough for a pilot to crawl through, as happened
in an accident last year at Newark International Airport in which a
plane flipped upside down on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the instructions are to land at the nearest suitable
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder, whose pings were still heard on
Tuesday, is likely to give investigators more information on the
plane's condition. And the cockpit itself is a crucial goal for the
investigators. They are expecting the arrival of the U.S. Navy
salvage ship Grapple on Wednesday; a veteran of the TWA 800
recovery effort, it should begin work later this week.

EMBATTLED SENATOR ACCUSES CRITIC OF RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's re-election bid took an
emotional turn when she angrily lost her composure during a Labor
Day event and used a racial epithet to characterize herself as a
target of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism of her personal and political conduct in
a nationally syndicated column written by George Will,
Moseley-Braun said, ``I think because he could not say `nigger,' he
said the word `corrupt.''' (The word ``corrupt'' never actually
appeared in the column.)
</P>
<P>
   She also said, ``George Will can just take his hood and go back
to wherever he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator apologized for the outburst several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my anger, I lost my temper and used language that was not
appropriate,'' she said in a statement. ``I am sorry. For more than
five years, I've endured baseless charges and reckless insinuations
that were intended to divert attention from my solid record of
accomplishment as a United States Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an episode that seemed to underscore how sensitive
Moseley-Braun is to ethical questions that have been raised for
years about her financial practices before and during her 1992
campaign and about a 1996 meeting she had with Nigeria's brutal
dictator, Sani Abacha, who died this year.
</P>
<P>
   And it comes during a tough re-election battle for
Moseley-Braun, the first African-American woman in the Senate, as
she tries to hold on to what Democratic leaders consider one of the
party's most vulnerable Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have suggested that Moseley-Braun, who was swept
into office in 1992, is in an insecure position for an incumbent,
especially in a year when many incumbents are expected to do well.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a poll conducted by The Chicago Tribune found
Moseley-Braun trailing her opponent, State Sen. Peter Fitzgerald,
39 percent to 46 percent, with a margin of error of four percentage
points. It also showed that women, who supported her overwhelmingly
in 1992, were sharply divided about her.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a poll published in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
showed Fitzgerald leading by 46 percent to 35 percent with a margin
of error of four points.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons why Moseley-Braun has a tough fight
ahead of her. One is expected low turnout, made potentially lower
by President Clinton's problems. Another is money.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, a conservative from a wealthy banking family in the
northern suburbs of Chicago with an estimated net worth of $40
million, spent $6 million on the Republican primary and recently
embarked on a television advertising campaign expected to cost as
much as $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, on the other hand, pulled out of debt for the
first time last year. Her latest campaign filing shows her war
chest at $1 million, although her campaign consultant, Eric
Adelstein, said more was coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Will's column included a reprise of accusations that
Moseley-Braun and her former fiance and 1992 campaign manager,
Kgosie Matthews, spent tens of thousands of dollars on travel,
clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment. The Federal Election
Commission dropped its investigation of those accusations last
year, saying the reputed violations were not as serious as those in
other cases before the commission, that staff time was scarce and
that the statute of limitations might have run out.
</P>
<P>
   The column mentioned Moseley-Braun's trip, with Matthews, to
Nigeria to meet with Abacha, a visit that was criticized by the
State Department and members of her own party.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun has acknowledged in the past that she made
mistakes. She attributes some of her actions to naivete about the
scrutiny and attention a senator attracts.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators suggested that Moseley-Braun deliberately
tried to draw attention to her race. Others said the remarks were
too emotional to be calculated. Tuesday, Moseley-Braun made further
efforts to diffuse the attention over her statements. She faxed a
letter of apology to Will saying, ``I should not have called your
motives into question.''
</P>
<P>
   Will responded with a hand-written note that referred to
something that has Chicago natives brimming with pride: the home
run crusade of Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apology accepted,'' Will wrote. ``Go Sammy!''

BOXER REBUKES CLINTON ON LEWINSKY MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of President
Clinton's staunchest allies, joined the growing ranks of Democrats
Tuesday to publicly denounce the president for his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, calling it ``wrong and indefensible'' and
``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Boxer stopped short of calling for Clinton to resign or
be impeached, her comments on the Senate floor offered more
troubling evidence for Clinton that Democratic support is
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The president has now agreed,'' said Boxer, whose daughter
was married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother in a White House
ceremony four years ago. ``I fervently wish he had seen it that way
before the relationship started, and in any case, he should have
taken responsibility much earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's statement followed a stern rebuke issued in the same
venue last week by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat
and longtime Clinton confidant, that was supported by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates two things,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
scientist at the University of Virginia. ``How much trouble Barbara
Boxer is in, and how much trouble Bill Clinton is in.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is in dead-even race to hold her Senate seat this November
against Republican challenger Matt Fong. Political analysts now
rank Boxer as one of the two most vulnerable Democratic incumbents
in the Senate this November, along with Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky affair put Boxer in a particularly tight spot. She
won election to the Senate six years ago largely as a champion of
women's rights and has made it a centerpiece of political career.
In comparison to her high-profile role during the confirmation
hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and the move to
oust former Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, a Republican, her subdued
reaction to the Clinton matter has not gone unnoticed by her
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Boxer tried to walk a fine line, drawing a distinction
between personal morality and what she called ``public policy
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be grateful to (Clinton) for his visionary
public policies in so many areas, and so will the people of
California,'' said Boxer, who signaled her support for Lieberman's
speech, as well as the president's response to it, at a campaign
stop in California on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there are differences in this body about the
immorality of the president's relationship with an intern,'' but
the Senate's agenda should also ``deal with public policy
morality,'' she said, citing proposed legislation on health
maintenance organizations, after-school programs and other
Democratic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fong swiftly issued a press release cataloging a long list of
Boxer's public statements on sexual harassment, contrasting her
strident tone during the Thomas hearings and the Navy's
``Tailhook'' scandal to her reaction to Paula Jones' allegations
against Clinton, which Boxer said should be handled by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she decided to come forward after supporters on the
campaign trail told her they understood she needed to address the
Lewinsky matter while expressing concern that no one was addressing
public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is we need to allow the process to move
forward and be very clear in our disapproval, and yet work with
this president for the good of the people,'' said Boxer. ``That's
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   As more details of the impending report by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr continue to leak out, Boxer's statement was among the
many signs that discontent among Democrats is snowballing.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Sen. Fritz Hollings, another Democrat in a
difficult re-election bid, joined Boxer Tuesday. ``We're fed up,''
Hollings said. ``The behavior, the dishonesty of the president is
unacceptable, and we'll see with the report what course the
Congress will take.''
</P>
<P>
   And over the weekend, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, also
in a tight re-election bid, canceled an Oct. 2 fund-raiser with
Clinton, turning down what originally was hoped to be a boost of
hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to focus on the details (of the report),''
Sabato said, ``and whatever your views of Bill Clinton, the details
are truly disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for a closed-door meeting with congressional
Democrats Wednesday, but the impending Starr report, coming on the
heels of Clinton's combative televised apology, is making it
difficult for members to rally to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks want to see what's in the Starr report as quickly as
possible, but what they hear about what's in the report only
amplifies their worst nightmares,'' said a Senate Republican
leadership aide. ``No one up for re-election wants to stand before
the public every day and every night between now and November and
be faced with one of three choices: defending the president,
condemning the president, or the worst of all worlds, which Barbara
Boxer tried to live in for three weeks, which is essentially to say
nothing and try to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   California Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo said Boxer has
lost support from Republican women from six years ago, when she ran
as a fighter for women's rights. ``That has given way to a much
more partisan view of Boxer,'' DiCamillo said. ``It doesn't seem
she's able to attract females across the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   But California Democratic Party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland
scoffed at the notion that the Lewinsky scandal is having any
repercussions in California.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout is ``zero'' Mulholland said, citing polls that say
76 percent of the public thinks Clinton should serve out his term.
``Only the Republicans who are spinning it and most of the
reporters who can't help themselves think there's a fallout from an
American president being a human with mistakes,'' Mulholland said.

LERNER WINS OWNERSHIP OF CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Lerner, the favorite from day one to end up with the NFL
expansion franchise, made the Cleveland Browns the most exepensive
team in the sports history Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, who made billions in the credit card business, withstood
four ballots before the NFL owners finally voted him into their
exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for ownership of the Cleveland franchise, which will
field a team in 1999 in the AFC, came down to Lerner and Chuck
Dolan, who made his fortune in cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The owners met in Chicago Tuesday afternoon and were informed by
the New York investment firm of Goldman Sachs that Lerner and Dolan
were the two top bidders in a field that originally numbered seven.
Three dropped out last week, including Jerry Jacobs, onwer of the
Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four submitted their final offers over the
weekend. By rule, 23 of the 30 owners needed to vote in favor of
the franchise recipient. Even though Lerner was the high man with a
bid of $530 million, it took four ballots for him to win the day.
In the end, Art Modell, the former Cleveland owner, asked his
fellow owners to make Lerner a unanimous choice. All voted in
favor, except Oakland's Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Modell was the most anti-Lerner owner in the
room. But once it became obvious that his candidate, Dolan, could
not win, Modell moved for Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's victory _ for a price that dwarfs the previous sports
franchise record, the $350 million Rupert Murdoch paid for the Los
Angeles Dodgers this year _ means that Carmen Policy, former
president and general manager of the San Francisco 49ers, will
assume the top team management role under Lerner. Policy left the
Niners last month in a dispute with owner Eddie DeBartolo and cast
his lot with Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the NFL expanded to Carolina and
Jacksonville, the cost for those two teams was about $200 million.
Tampa Bay later sold for about the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay owner Malcolm Glazier, along with Davis and Jerry
Jones of Dallas, had all said publicly that the Browns should sell
for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, last week the guessing was that the final price would
be $500 milllion-$600 million. Some $54 million of this money will
go toward paying for cost overruns in the construction of the
football stadium being completed in downtown Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner is not a popular choice in Cleveland. He is considered a
traitor by many Browns fans because he helped Modell move the
former NFL franchise out of town to Baltimore three years ago.
Later Modell and Lerner had a falling out, but this still did not
appease many of the Cleveland fans.
</P>
<P>
   But he is the man now, and with Policy, a proven winner at the
helm, a very generous draft package (two players in every round for
two yeras) and some $33 million to spend on free agents, the new
Browns should have a good team in quick order.

INVESTORS LATCH ONTO FED'S HINT OF RATE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If global investors had their way, Alan Greenspan
would head a planetary central bank, not just an American one.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of their desparation for economic leadership in a
newly treacherous world, investors from Tokyo to New York have sent
stock prices flying in the wake of a Friday speech by the Federal
Reserve chairman suggesting that the US central bank is now deeply
concerned about financial troubles aboard, and might cut US
interest rates if problems persist.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that investors' reaction is especially striking
because of how little Greenspan actually said; how little most
expect him to do quickly, and how little difference whatever he
does is likely to make beyond US borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reading too much into the speech,'' said Edgar E.
Peters, chief investment strategist for PanAgora Asset Management
in Boston, which manages $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, suggested Peters and others, the global rally Monday
and Tuesday _ which was already being dubbed ``the Greenspan
rebound'' _ was less a measure of the Fed's awesome powers than it
was a gauge of the near total lack of leadership by the world's
major economies in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, there's a government policy group that
seems to be watching out for trouble before it happens, and that's
the Fed,'' said Peters. ``That kind of vigilence is a rare
commodity in this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan is the world's economic leadership at the
moment,'' added Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the surge in stock markets worldwide makes some
sense given what Greenspan said. An interest rate cut by the Fed
would spur the US economy and, along with it, US imports. Greater
imports could help damaged economies in Asia and elsewhere sell
their way out of their problems.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that the dimensions of the runup went far
beyond what the central banker's remarks warrant. For example, in
Toyko, the bellwether Nikkei 225 stock average jumped 747.15
points, or 5.3 percent Monday, and was on the rise again last
night. Stocks soared 23 percent in Maylasia. With the exception of
London, virtually every European market was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most complex financial crisis that we've
seen since the Cold War'' and there is only so much the Fed can do
about it, said Richard B. Berner, chief economist with Mellon Bank
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Greenspan warned that the United States could not
continue growing in the face of global troubles, and said that the
central bank is now as concerned about those troubles as it is
about its traditonal foe, inflation. He hinted that the Fed might
cut interest rates to ensure continued US growth.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts said Tuesday that they do not expect an
interest rate reduction until later this year at the earliest, and
even then only if the global crisis has clearly spilled over into
the United States. To date, most effects of the crisis here have
been two-edged, for example, hurting US exporters, but helping
consumers with cheaper imports and lower market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If investors are looking for instant gratification, they're
not going to get it,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist
with Goldman Sachs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If and when, the Fed does cut rates, the reduction is likely to
be modest and aimed at protecting US growth, not repairing global
economic damage. ``I don't know whether they can insulate the US
from all of the major risks, but they certainly can't insulate the
world,'' McKelvey said.
</P>
<P>
   A Fed rate cut ``is not going to solve very many of the world's
problems,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the central
bank who is now a senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association in Washington, D.C. ``It's not going to help Russia.
It's not going to help Japan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the fact that financial markets reacted so
enthusiastically to Greenspan's remarks despite the limits of Fed
powers signals how much investors and ordinary citizens around the
world are looking for economic leadership, but have yet to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major economies offered some leadership in the
early stages of the Asian crisis last year, their chief instrument
of influence, the International Monetary Fund, is widely seen as
discredited after its austerity policies failed to stem the spread
of trouble. Since then, a series of unrelated political upheavals,
including the Monica Lewinksy scandals here, have sapped Western
leaders of much of their ability to act.

<P>
   Like thousands of other elderly Americans, Eugene DeLorenzo of
Chico, Calif, cannot find a Medicare health maintenance
organization in his area.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorenzo, a 75-year-old retired real estate broker and his
wife, Yuriko, enrolled July 1 in the Medicare plan of Health Net, a
unit of Foundation Health Systems Inc. Just three weeks later,
Health Net _ unable to make a strong profit in Butte County, the
rural northern county where DeLorenzo lives _ said it was ending
its coverage there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Well, what are we going to do now?'''
DeLorenzo recalled. ``It wasn't going to do any good to get angry.
That's just the way these HMOs operate.''
</P>
<P>
   With few options, the DeLorenzos enrolled in traditional
fee-for-service Medicare, the federally financed health care plan
for the disabled and people 65 or older. They may also have to pay
hundreds of dollars more in premiums for a supplemental policy to
replace the generous benefits Health Net had offered.
</P>
<P>
   People like the DeLorenzos are fast becoming common statistics.
After aggressively recruiting the elderly and the disabled into
their Medicare plans, many of the nation's HMOs are now heavily
retreating.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp., once a darling of Wall Street, recently
took a $900 million charge against earnings, in part to scale back
its Medicare operations in 35 counties. In the last year, Aetna,
Pacificare Health Systems, Oxford Health Plans, Foundation Health
Systems, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield
associations have canceled Medicare plans in parts of 13 states.
Virtually no Medicare HMOs are available in Utah or in rural Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicare costs escalating wildly, Congress has long looked
to managed-care plans as the prime remedy. Introduced in 1985 to
allow private insurers to cover the elderly, Medicare HMOs provide
health care more cheaply than the government does. They also tend
to offer more benefits to consumers and reduce the amount of claims
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the HMO problems in the Medicare market, Washington is
now pushing for even more people to enroll in the plans. Yet
financial setbacks for some HMOs have raised serious questions as
to whether they can prosper covering Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Though critics of managed care are quick to say they cannot,
analysts say that several HMOs _ namely Humana Inc. and Pacificare,
two of the nation's largest Medicare providers _ are making money
on their plans, at least for now. But even these companies have had
to make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few HMOs that can be successful with Medicare, and
they should prosper,'' said Kenneth Abramowitz, a health care
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. `` Still, he added, ``Some
of these earnings charges related to Medicare, United Healthcare's
for example, show just how difficult this business is.''
</P>
<P>
   Several problems have bedeviled Medicare HMOs. For one thing,
only 15.6 percent of Medicare's 37.5 million members are enrolled
in Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government says it has overpaid the Medicare HMOs,
the companies say the federal monthly stipend for each enrollee is
not enough to provide extensive benefits. That is especially
problematic in rural areas, where Medicare HMOs cannot enroll
enough members to negotiate discounts with local health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts say, HMOs must focus primarily on urban
markets and must avoid offering generous prescription drug plans,
which can attract a disproportionate number of sickly people.
</P>
<P>
   While Medicare has long been a perilous market for many HMOs, it
may soon get even tougher. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will
reduce the government's Medicare spending by $115 billion over the
next five years. Increases in the monthly stipends the government
pays to HMOs have been sharply reduced, a move that could further
lower operating margins, which have always been thin and now hover
around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies receive some $5,688 annually on average
for each of their Medicare patients, according to the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam's stipend comes with strings attached. The HMOs
usually agree to provide more benefits than traditional Medicare
does _ allowances for prescription drugs, hearing aids and
eyeglasses. And they accept the premise that they can make profits
by controlling costs better than the government can.
</P>
<P>
   A key to a healthy bottom line is to avoid a large percentage of
sick patients, which can quickly devour revenues. The odds appear
to be in the Medicare health maintenance organizations' favor: 90
percent of all Medicare enrollees are generally healthy and require
only about $1,200 on average from the government each year for
medical bills, according to the Urban Institute's analysis of the
1996 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the latest figures
available.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the analysis found, the remaining 10 percent, who
are sick, cost Medicare some $37,000 a year each.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that in metropolitan markets with several
competing Medicare plans, HMOs used prescription drug benefits to
entice elderly members and ended up subsidizing lofty prescription
drug bills. Moreover, the HMOs can end their exposure to ailing
members only by leaving a county altogether, not by dropping
coverage of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Humana and Pacificare have hedged the likelihood of losses by
contracting with doctors to accept a fixed monthly payment for each
member, regardless how much medical care that person may need. The
policy, called capitation, pushes the financial risk onto the
doctor to keep medical costs down.
</P>
<P>
   Humana had 60 percent of its Medicare members in capitation
arrangements at the end of the second quarter, aiming to increase
the figure to 70 percent by the end of the year. Capitation paid
the company big dividends. Revenues from Medicare HMOs accounted
for half of the total earnings at Humana last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitation is a great way to share the risk and to control
costs,'' said Arun Kumar, a director at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``It
works best with populations who are sophisticated about managed
care. You see a lot of capitation on the West Coast. It's unlikely
to be used on the East Coast, partly because there are a large
number of specialists who don't want to share the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To be profitable with their Medicare plans, HMOs may have little
choice but to establish capitation policies wherever they can.
Before the Balanced Budget Act, it was common for the government to
give HMOs annual stipend increases of 10 percent in some counties,
a sum that many complained was too little. The increase has now
been reduced to about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With a rise that slim _ it is less than half the national
medical cost inflation rate _ some HMOs will have to renegotiate
rates with health care providers. But the industry has other
troubles. Although the Balanced Budget Act gradually raises the
stipend HMOs receive for rural counties, critics doubt that the
increase will be enough. Rural areas often have only one hospital,
which has no incentive to lower its rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some rural areas, there is just not enough of a premium to
cover the costs,'' said Lee Newcomer, medical director at United
Healthcare. ``A lot of people who live in a rural area drive into
the city for medical treatment. They incur a city cost while we get
paid the rural premium.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have also struggled to control their administration fees.
Medicare plans, which must be sold in person, are more expensive
than traditional commercial accounts, which may be pitched by
telephone. Elderly people like to meet with company
representatives, and they prefer seeing the plans' benefits and
costs displayed in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that to survive, Medicare HMOs must cut back on
benefits, a process that has riled consumers. According to
Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein, most HMOs are giving each
Medicare enrollee $1,000 in benefits beyond basic hospital coverage
but can afford only $750.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks have already begun, and the most expensive perks
are the first to go. In nearly every market where HMOs have slashed
their offerings, this has has meant tossing out the prescription
drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed up for Secure Horizons because they had a good
prescription drug plan,'' said Hollie Vinson, 43, who is disabled
and lives in Chico, Calif. ``Shortly after that, they discontinued
the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to go out and get my own drug plan,'' she added,
``and it costs more than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons, Ms. Vinson's Medicare HMO, is a unit of
Pacificare, one of California's biggest managed-care companies.
Pacificare's cuts went a lot further elsewhere: The company ended
its Medicare coverage in Utah and in parts of Washington and Oregon
because of thin operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   Market woes are so severe that experts wonder if any Medicare
HMO can prosper indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say a financially sound Medicare HMO may be a
horror to its members. Opponents of capitation contend that the
policy prompts too many doctors to choose costs over sound health
care, saving nickels by canceling tests that are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts question the effectiveness of the government's efforts
to lure more people into managed care. Under the Balanced Budget
Act, those 65 and over can sign up beginning next year for
preferred provider organizations, a network of doctors and
hospitals that accepts government payments for Medicare patients,
or for a provider-sponsored organization, a network that is usually
owned by the providers.
</P>
<P>
   These plans could help Medicare HMOs by introducing more elderly
people to managed care. But an efficient provider-sponsored group
can also steal healthy members from a Medicare HMO in its county.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few providers are offering one of the new plans, leaving
many experts to question their viability.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say these new plans could be slow sellers,
given the snail's pace at which Americans have embraced Medicare
HMOs. Thirteen states have no Medicare HMO plans at all, and even
areas that have usually welcomed new types of health care remain
stubbornly suspicious. Arizona and California have among the
highest percentages of Medicare enrollment, at 39 percent each, but
only 18 percent of New York's 2.6 million Medicare members are
enrolled in HMOs and the penetration in Wisconsin is only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving HMO companies the opportunity to offer more Medicare
plans is only going to make matters worse,'' said Bonnie Burns, a
health care consultant in Scotts Valley, Calif. ``They will keep
the plans that are in profitable areas and drop the others that are
not. Some people in some cities will have six plans while people in
other cities will have none.''

 &HT;    Maris liked to keep low profile
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His son, Kevin, said Roger Maris would be looking down and
``watching every swing'' as St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman Mark
McGwire broke his father's single-season home run record of 61.
Maris, an outfielder with the New York Yankees, set the record
during the 1961 season. Here are some facts about Maris:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was Roger Maris?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maris played in the major leagues with four teams,1957-68 and
was the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1960 and '61, his
first two years with the New York Yankees. He played his last two
seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals. Maris, who was born in
Hibbing, Minn., and grew up in Fargo, N.D., signed with the
Cleveland Indians after graduating from high school, where he also
had been a football standout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old was he when he broke Babe Ruth's record?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maris was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Maris in the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most baseball writers say that they think that Maris had
a Hall of Fame season in 1961 but not a Hall of Fame career. In 12
seasons, Maris compiled a .260 batting average. He hit 275 home
runs. Although Maris is not in the Hall of Fame, both the ball he
hit for No. 61 and the bat he used are in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How close was he to the end of the season when he hit No. 61?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. 61 came in the fourth inning on the final day of the 1961
regular season. His homer off rookie Tracy Stallard gave the
Yankees a 1-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did he hit a lot of home runs before the '61 season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maris had hit 28 home runs in 1958 while playing for
Cleveland and Kansas City and 39 homers during the 1960 season with
the Yankees. He followed with 33 homers in 1962. The fence in
Yankee Stadium during Maris' playing days was 296 feet down the
right-field line. And Maris, a left-handed hitter, was a dead pull
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the nation respond to his record-breaking season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many baseball fans, and writers, did not want to see Babe
Ruth's record fall. If the record had to fall, most rooted for
Maris' teammate, Mickey Mantle. Maris was booed on the road and
sometimes at home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the deal with the asterisk?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ruth hit 60 homers when the length of the baseball season was
154 games. Maris hit 61 the first year baseball expanded to a
10-team American League and a 162-game schedule. Baseball
commissioner Ford Frick ruled in late July that Ruth's record would
stand unless it was broken during the first 154 games. The
figurative asterisk was removed in 1991 by then-commissioner Fay
Vincent. Maris, however, was not around to see it; he died Dec. 14,
1985, at the age of 51.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of man was Maris?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maris, who was married and had six children, preferred to
keep a low profile and was comfortable playing in the shadows of
his more-famous teammates, including Mickey Mantle. ``I just want
to be a good ballplayer,'' Maris said. ``I just wanted to be one of
the guys.'' It was painful for Maris when he became the focus
during the run at Ruth's record. He often complained about the
pressure of being in the limelight.

 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Wendy Levy Jackson is a successful real estate broker,
but you can't blame her for tuning in every night for the latest on
Mark McGwire's quest to surpass Roger Maris as baseball's
single-season home run king.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she has about 3,000 McGwire baseball cards, part of
an unusual inheritance from her late husband, Stanley Jackson. And
she has another 500 or so of McGwire posing with Jose Canseco when
they were with the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he'd hit another one, my friends would call and
congratulate me,'' said Jackson, who is 51. ``We were all rooting
for him. One of my friends said, `You would think he's my relative
or something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how Stanley Jackson, who died in March 1997, would have
reveled in McGwire's home run success this season, Wendy went to
the Mount Nebo-Levitt Weinstein Cemetery in South Miami-Dade, where
her late husband is buried, after McGwire had hit four out of Pro
Player Stadium last week in two games against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   She was there about four minutes when she heard someone softly
call her name. It was Howard Rosen, her husband's longtime friend,
who had gone to the cemetery for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both appreciated how much he would have just loved this,''
Jackson said Tuesday, looking around her South Miami-Dade townhouse
at the impact McGwire had on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Jackson had adopted McGwire as one of his favorite
players in a three-year frenzy of baseball-card collecting that
began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a veterinarian by day and he did baseball cards by
night and weekends,'' she said. ``I watched him do it for a while,
then I figured I might as well get involved, and I'd go with him to
some of the card shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her husband, she became known in local baseball card
show circles as ``Ms. Mint,'' for having an abundance of mint
condition cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her most valuable cards now are squirreled away in safe-deposit
boxes, and her lesser ones fill a storeroom. She has cards of
McGwire in a variety of hitting poses, as well as him on defense.
She initially thought she had just 2,487 of McGwire, until she
found a 500-card album of him during various stages of his career
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   His most valuable card, according to Rheal McMullen, owner of
Sports Cards USA in Sunrise, Fla., is No. 401 _ a 1985 Topps of
McGwire with the United States Olympic team before his first season
with the Oakland A's. This is McGwire's official rookie card.
</P>
<P>
   A rare mint condition card of that variety can bring $1,400,
according to McMullen. Lesser quality Topps '85's can bring between
$200 and $300, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she has 148 of those cards, most of which are in
excellent condition. Ron Tannenbaum, who puts on baseball card
shows in South Florida, said the new rates are coming out later
this week, and he expects McGwire's cards to be ``about 50 percent
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything with McGwire is going up,'' McMullen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Waldo Rodriguez, who owns the Sports Card Center in the Little
Havana section of Miami, said most of his customers seek out
McGwire memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as cards, the rookie card is what everybody is looking
for,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she never asked her husband why he liked McGwire so
much, but he did leave a clue as to why he accumulated nearly
100,000 sports cards, 90 percent of them in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Florida journalism alumnus, he wrote this in an
alumni publication:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mick is middle-aged, The Duke of Flatbush has gray hair,
Stan The Man from St. Louis owns restaurants . . . and Billy Martin
is dead. How come, then, I still collect baseball cards? Because my
young son rekindled a former passion. Because I grew up with
baseball and I'll die with baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was not the only player who was popular with Stanley
Jackson. He has about 3,000 of Wally Joyner's cards, because of his
son David's fondness for the current San Diego first baseman. He
also has ``untold boxes'' of Reggie Jackson, the former Oakland and
Yankees slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson now would like to sell the whole collection at one time,
and has set up a separate phone number _ 305-981-7672 _ to do so.
She estimates that her husband invested between $50,000 and $60,000
in the cards, plus a big chunk of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I do, I am going to be careful about it,'' she said.
``Stanley put his heart and soul into this.''

 &HT;    So, how many CAN he hit? Baseball writers wager guesses
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When Roger Maris passed Babe Ruth for the
single-season home run record, he hit No. 61 on the last day of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire passed Maris on Tuesday during his club's 145th
game, leaving him 17 games and a host of chances to add to his
total.
</P>
<P>
   In asampling of baseball writers covering the event, some think
McGwire could hit as many as 70. At the current rate, based on a
162-game season, McGwire would finish with 69; Chicago's Sammy Sosa
would have 65, and Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. would hit 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him hitting 70, but he could get to 68,'' said
Jerry Crasnick of the Bloomberg News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Sherman of the New York Post also thinks 68 is a reasonable
number. ``That means we can give him the goal of 70 next year,''
Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he thinks McGwire can reach 70, which would be an
incredible standard considering that the most hit in the first 129
years of professional baseball was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule favors McGwire. Houston is the only team remaining
on St. Louis' schedule that is involved in a playoff race. The
Cardinals have five games against the Astros. St. Louis ends its
season at home against Montreal, a team that continues to pitch a
very young rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like McGwire will be facing a lot of clubs where
Craig McMurtry would be their No. 1 starter,'' said Bud Shaw of the
Cleveland Plain Dealer. Shaw refers to the former Braves starter,
who was 9-17 for Atlanta in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed also think Sosa will have no chance of catching
McGwire down the stretch. The Cubs are in the middle of an intense
wild card race, and Sosa cannot afford to swing for the fences
during every at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Oakland teammate Jose Canseco, who plays for Toronto,
said he thinks McGwire has a good chance to break his own record
before his career ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know him,'' Canseco said. ``He will come out next
season working as hard as he did this year and try to hit more.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think McGwire's numbers will drop. At age
34, he appears to be in the best shape of his career. This season,
he has played in his most games since 1991, when he appeared in 154
for the A's, and his production level has improved. He hit 39
homers in 1995, 52 in '96 and 58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron hit 245 more homers after his 35th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also wants to hit 500 home runs during his career. He is
at 448.
</P>
<P>
   But what may push McGwire the most is McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of years left and he is in great shape,'' said
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who has been with McGwire since
his days in Oakland. ``He is going to hit a lot more homers.''

STARR EXPECTED TO SUBMIT REPORT TO CONGRESS IN NEXT FEW DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd and 4th grafs for rewriting to offer important
qualifications about the likely content of Starr's report.)  (See also CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-SCHOOL)

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dismissing objections from the White House, Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, plans to deliver a
report to Congress, as early as the end of this week, summarizing
his eight-month inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, allies of Starr said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr intends to alert House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a letter
on Wednesday that he will submit his report containing substantial
and credible evidence that may be the grounds for impeachment of
the president, according to lawyers familiar with Starr's plans.
Prosecutors are also planning to convene the grand jury here on
Thursday, in a signal that it will continue its criminal inquiry
even after a report is sent to the House of Representatives, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to outline Starr's investigation into
whether the president's conduct amounted to perjury in a civil
deposition, obstruction of justice, lying to a grand jury, witness
tampering and abuse of power, the lawyers said. They have indicated
that the report will almost certainly say the president lied under
oath in a deposition in January.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to include an embarrassing description of Clinton's
conduct with Ms. Lewinsky and a scorching appraisal of his use of
White House lawyers and claims of privilege in response to the
inquiry this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a prickly four-page letter incongruously addressed ``Dear
David,'' Starr on Tuesday rejected a request from David Kendall,
the president's private lawyer, for an advance review of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to gain his political footing as Democratic senators
continued to pummel him on Tuesday for his behavior, Clinton
hastily set up a meeting for 8:30 a.m. Wednesday with House
Democratic leaders. Advisers to Clinton said he planned to address
the Lewinsky matter, apologizing and asking forgiveness for
misleading the legislators and the nation, and for potentially
damaging the party's prospects in elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may offer another public apology later this week,
perhaps at a prayer breakfast at the White House on Friday morning,
advisers said. Clinton has made a series of increasingly direct
statements of regret since he acknowledged the relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky in a brief, defiant address on Aug. 17, after seven
months of denials.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to come back into session on Wednesday
afternoon, and the White House is anxious to smother the Democratic
criticism that began rising in the Senate last Thursday, when Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, trailed by other Democrats, took
to the floor to denounce Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, previously reluctant Democrats, including Sen.
Barbara Boxer of California, joined the chorus of criticism. Ms.
Boxer, whose daughter married a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton,
called Clinton's behavior ``immoral'' and ``indefensible,'' while
defending his agenda and accomplishments in a speech on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued in a letter to Starr on Monday that the special
prosecutor had no legal authority to write a report analyzing his
findings _ but that if he chose to do so, he had an obligation out
of ``fundamental fairness'' to permit an advance review by
Clinton's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr wrote on Tuesday that he had a legal responsibility to
issue a report to Congress analyzing the evidence, and no authority
to provide a preview to the White House. He refused to acknowledge
that he was preparing a report, but as he cited sources from the
Constitution to Webster's dictionary, he left little doubt as to
how high he considers the stakes in his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view,'' he wrote, ``it is for Congress, the repository
of impeachment power, to decide if and when such information should
be provided to your client.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also made it clear that he believes his prosecutors have
wide latitude in the preparation of a report. He quoted Alexander
Hamilton, who wrote in The Federalist papers that impeachment
proceedings should not ``be tied down to ... strict rules, either
in the delineation of the offence by the prosecutors, or in the
construction of it by the Judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders also scorned Kendall's request
on Tuesday. ``Why should they get special treatment?'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said to reporters. ``I presume they'll
get it when the House gets it. They'll have a chance to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton adviser outside the White House said that the
president's lawyers might go to court to try to force Starr to
permit them to review the report, perhaps delaying its delivery.
</P>
<P>
   But another senior adviser said that Clinton's lawyers had not
expected Starr to agree to Kendall's request. He said that in
discussions last week, legal and political advisers came to a
consensus that the primary purpose of Kendall's letter was
political, to suggest that Starr was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep.
Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, is scheduled to sit
down with Gingrich and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the
House Judiciary Committee to discuss how to handle the Starr report
when it is delivered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Close advisers of Clinton had not expected Starr to deliver his
report so soon, and some of them are concerned that the White House
is not prepared to respond to it. Kendall asked in his letter to
review the report at least a week before delivery, unsuspecting
that Starr might deliver it to Congress within a week of the letter
itself.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that they expect the report to include
graphic sexual details of the intimate relationship Clinton has
acknowledged with Ms. Lewinsky, whom he met in 1995 when she was a
21-year-old unpaid White House intern. It is the prospect that such
seamy material will be disclosed, these aides said, that has scared
congressional Democrats and prompted them to back away from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The precise contents of the report remain closely held. But
prosecutors have been drafting sections that accuse Clinton of a
variety of crimes, including obstruction of justice and encouraging
others to lie under oath, lawyers familiar with Starr's plans have
said. Prosecutors are also considering whether to accuse Clinton of
perjuring himself in his deposition in January in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in that
deposition. But he said in his address to the nation on Aug. 17
that his reponse was ``legally accurate,'' basing that claim, his
advisers have said, on a definition of sexual relations used by
Mrs. Jones' lawyers. Clinton made a similar claim in grand jury
testimony on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Starr's team might challenge Clinton's
interpretation, and accuse him of perjury before the grand jury,
raises the specter of a tawdry debate over what kind of intimate
contact constitutes sex.
</P>
<P>
   In their exchange of letters, Starr and Kendall quarreled over
everything from the intent of the Founding Fathers to the meaning
of the word ``information.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Starr was permitted by law to provide Congress with
``substantial and credible information,'' Kendall argued that the
prosecutor could not go past that authority to summarize or analyze
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr wrote that his dictionary defined information in part
as ``[k)nowledge derived from study,'' which, he said, left room
for analysis of facts. He wrote that the law also suggested that
prosecutors must use their judgment to determine if evidence is
``substantial and credible'' and whether it ``may constitute
grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' he wrote, ``the independent counsel is duty bound
to provide Congress with his analysis of the information so that
Congress can make its own informed decision.''

COMMENTARY: VIEW FROM THE LIMO  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ This is what Bill Clinton saw from the
window of his limousine.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the man who hungered his whole life to be
president, the man who has such a voracious need to be loved, the
man who cares so much about how history judges him, saw as his
motorcade left the Pine Crest Elementary School here, after he got
a warm reception from the handpicked crowd for a speech on
education.
</P>
<P>
   As the president smiled and waved behind the tinted windshield,
he saw a man holding a sign, above his 19-month-old daughter in a
stroller, that read, ``President, Stay Away From Our Daughters.''
He saw a man, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth, holding a sign
that read: ``Get Lost.'' He saw a small group of protesters booing
and holding a 10-foot banner that read, ``Time to Impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't witness was even worse. Before the president sped
past, a Secret Service agent approached a group of children, after
one child had dropped a pencil on the gravel, and asked if they
were picking up rocks to throw at the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   A group of four Catholic schoolgirls from nearby St.
Bernadette's, thrilled to see the president, stationed themselves
in the best vantage point _ under the ``Time to Impeach'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Victoria Chapa, 10, asked giddily: ``Is Monica
Lewinsky going to come by?''
</P>
<P>
   But the mood in this Washington suburb was serene compared with
what the president faced back in the federal city.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, all of Bill Clinton's great escapes and
semantic dodges and political stratagems were failing him. He was
trapped, checkmated, spiraling. Even his political rivals seemed
shaken to see Clinton lose his famous resilience. The mood was
ominous. Janet Reno was opening an investigation into her boss'
campaign finance methods. The capital was bracing for Kenneth
Starr's X-rated report. Following the upbraidings by Joseph
Lieberman, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Bob Kerrey, one of the
president's most fanatic supporters, Barbara Boxer _ concerned with
saving her own political skin _ went to the floor of the Senate on
Tuesday and called the president's infidelity ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very sad and very strange to watch Clinton give speeches.
His words twang with unintended ironies and double-entendres. You
wonder how he can get through a day without shattering from the
pressure of watching his presidency melt. No one, except the
hard-core Clinton foes, is getting any pleasure out of seeing a
president who started with so many dreams live through so much
censure.
</P>
<P>
   At Pine Crest, Clinton seemed like a character from a Russian
novel, snared by his own conscience. He was talking about the
country, but it sounded as if he were talking about himself.
``Sometimes when things are going really, really well for people,
they get a little self-indulgent, easily distracted, and basically
just want to kick back and relax,'' he said. ``It's a natural
tendency for individuals. You go through a tough time, and you work
and you work and work, and things get really good _ you say, thank
goodness, things are not so bad as they used to be, I'm going to
relax. ... I believe that would be a serious error _ a serious
error _ because I think, again, at times when you have many
blessings, your responsibilities are greater.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage with the president was Richard Riley, the secretary of
education, who has privately said he feels betrayed by his old
friend's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was upbeat. But there was a wistful undertone. Here
was a president whose noble intentions for children and the poor
are threatened because his words have lost meaning, or taken on a
risible interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The president was urging ``higher levels of accountability'' and
more discipline for schools. He said that in guiding children,
actions speak louder than words.
</P>
<P>
   But this president has too often sloughed off the connection
between words and actions and refused to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have a lifetime of words. But a president has only a
limited time for meaningful actions. And Clinton will always have
to live with that knowledge.

NYC SCHOOL YEAR BEGINS WITHOUT THE USUAL SENSE OF CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's 1.1 million public school children begin
trudging back to class Wednesday to a system preoccupied with fewer
opening-day distractions than in any September in at least five
years but facing new pressures to convert this moment of relative
calm into lasting student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1983, the nation's largest school
district _ a system that has had 10 leaders in 15 years _ will open
its doors with a schools chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew, who has made it
to his fourth school year.
</P>
<P>
   Crew pledged Tuesday that this year's first day would bear
little resemblance to those of the past, with new classrooms
actually completed and free of workmen before students arrive, a
teacher assigned to virtually every class, a desk reserved for
virtually every student (a function, in part, of slowing enrollment
growth) and an absence of the outside political rancor that drove
out Crew's two immediate predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether class sizes will grow cannot be determined until the
year is under way, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the first-day jitters have come and gone, Crew said,
students, teachers and principals, as well as he himself, must push
themselves to meet standards higher than those of the past.
</P>
<P>
   High-school freshmen will have to start preparing now for a new
battery of stiff Regents exams that they will be required to pass
before they can graduate. Beginning this winter, fourth and eighth
graders will sit for new state standardized tests in reading and
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone has been put on notice that the system intends to
begin holding back failing students in the fourth and seventh
grades in the next school year. (For the last two decades, only a
fraction of failing students have had to repeat a grade.)
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to undermine those efforts, however, are potentially
inflammatory tensions simmering below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Crew and City Hall reached a tentative agreement to
expand the role of police in maintaining the safety of schools,
raising a host of unanswered questions about where the school
system's responsibility will end and the Police Department's will
begin, as well as whether the number of arrests in school buildings
will rise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the very foundation of the system _ its buildings _
continues to crumble, with hundreds of schools in need of
long-delayed repairs to roofs, walls, floors and boilers, and a
capital budget that addresses only a fraction of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis over the buildings' deterioration has been compounded
this year by a state mandate to find room for 14,000 4-year-olds
who have been enrolled in new prekindergarten programs. Tuesday,
school officials said that in the scramble for seats, they had yet
to find room for nearly 700 but hoped to do so by next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the first day of school for the nation's
largest district has been thick with an air of crisis, often real
and sometimes imagined _ the scouring of schools for asbestos in
September 1993, which delayed the start of the school year 11 days;
the bitter search for a new chancellor in the summer of 1995, which
spilled over into the first month of school; the desperate quest
for classroom space in the fall of 1996, when some students
streamed into newly constructed schools only to find carpenters
still installing windows and doors, and the sniping over school
conditions that was a central issue in last fall's mayoral
election.
</P>
<P>
   While some degree of opening-day chaos is almost inevitable in
any school system, let alone one comprising 1,100 schools, Crew
spoke Tuesday of several steps that had been taken to minimize the
disruptions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   After years of treating the hiring of qualified teachers with
the last-minute efficiency of a student cramming for an exam, the
Board of Education planned far ahead this year. A result, school
officials say, is that they hired 5,000 new teachers, many as early
as last spring. That, they say, should be enough to fill virtually
all classrooms by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, under pressure from the chancellor, the School Construction
Authority said that for the second straight year it had been able
to deliver all the new seats that it had promised the board _ about
10,000 _ in advance of opening day. They include two new schools,
Gateway Health and Sciences High School in Jamaica, Queens, with
605 seats, and Public School 56 on Staten Island, with 955 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of new classrooms will be in temporary trailers,
building additions and spaces partitioned from existing classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Though enrollment is projected to grow by only about 5,000 this
year, compared with increases of nearly 20,000 in recent years, the
system is still working its way out of a hole created in the 1980s
and '90s, with tens of thousands more students than its buildings
were intended to house.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said that undertaking long-term repairs would be a priority
this year. He said that he had recently met with Gov. George Pataki
and would soon visit Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to make the
case for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Crew would not specify how much he had requested, but the need
is estimated in the billions of dollars by the board and by city
officials. By November, the board is to submit a five-year capital
plan mapping out the board's priorities and strategy.

a big toll on the small but visible middle class, working for
banks, real estate and advertising agencies, start-up companies and

`HAPPINESS': SHOUTS OF RAGE AT THE WAY WE ARE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when the news media are awash in the gory
details of presidential sexual hijinks, the public is supposedly
beyond shock when it comes to revelations of bad behavior. Or is
it?
</P>
<P>
   The acid test will come with the first public American
screenings of Todd Solondz's pitch-black comedy ``Happiness,'' at
the New York Film Festival. The film was shown at the Cannes Film
Festival last spring and picked up for distribution by October
Films, but October had to back out under pressure from its parent,
Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness,'' which will be released in theaters on Oct. 16 by
Good Machine, is a gleeful, systematic demolition of the myth of
the suburban idyll. Set in a well-heeled New Jersey suburb, it
eviscerates the relationships among three sisters and their
extended family, finding bitterness, boredom, sexual dysfunction
and vicious sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial scenes involve a respected local
psychotherapist who pursues a secret life as a pedophile (he's
married to one of the sisters, who smugly prates on about ``having
it all''). Though not graphic, the scenes centering on this deeply
troubled character are all the more disturbing because he is almost
sympathetic and because the boys he molests are his 11-year-old
son's classmates.
</P>
<P>
   This is a film that feels as if it was conceived in a rage
against the forced cheer and phony togetherness promoted by
television sitcoms and feel-good Hollywood romances. In one scene
after another, the characters, several of whom are physically
unattractive and self-hating, voice their anger and disappointment
with one another in language that is stunning in its bluntness and
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   The only truly likable character is one of the sisters, a
Candide-like do-gooder named Joy, who is the butt of her siblings'
contempt and is presented as living proof that no good deed goes
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of the family and disgust with the status quo are
palpable in several other movies opening this fall. ``Lolita,''
Adrian Lynes' powerful, sad-hearted adaptation of the classic
Nabokov novel, which opens in theaters on Sept. 25, also evokes
pedophilia as the secret American vice.
</P>
<P>
   And Dominique Swain's extraordinary Lolita, a woman-child at
once brazenly seductive and painfully vulnerable, is one of the
year's most disquieting screen performances.
</P>
<P>
   Another film that punctures the sitcom-perfect vision of
American life is Gary Ross' elegant science-fiction fable
``Pleasantville,'' in which two contemporary teen-agers dive
through the looking glass, so to speak, and find themselves trapped
in a black-and-white television show that suggests a hybrid of
``Leave It to Beaver,'' ``Father Knows Best'' and an Archie comic
book.
</P>
<P>
   As the two refugees from the 1990s bring sex and rock-and-roll
into this eerily sanitized world, Pleasantville's perky cardboard
characters learn to cry and, losing their innocence, change from
black and white to living color.
</P>
<P>
   Much harsher is Peter Berg's contemporary comedy, ``Very Bad
Things,'' whose misanthropy and loathing of suburbia nearly match
those of ``Happiness.'' During a wild bachelor party in a Las Vegas
hotel room, one of five friends accidentally kills a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling the police, they decide to dispose of the
body, but not before a nosy hotel security guard interrupts them
and is murdered. After returning to their sterile Southern
California housing development in time for the wedding, rampant
paranoia and backstabbing lead to more killings (including a
fratricide), several of them engineered by Christian Slater as a
cool-headed real-estate salesman spouting the platitudes of a
television self-help guru. ``Very Bad Things'' has the courage to
be unabashedly hateful.
</P>
<P>
   The trashing of family values isn't limited to American films.
In ``The Celebration,'' the Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg has
created a viciously funny satire set at the elegant 60th birthday
bash of a pompous patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremonial toasts, his eldest son shocks the guests
by accusing his father of having raped him and his now-dead twin
sister when they were children. Another son turns out to be a
raving neo-Fascist.
</P>
<P>
   When the black boyfriend of a surviving daughter shows up
unexpectedly, the entire gathering joins in singing a crude racist
ditty. The film's message is inescapable: under a surface gloss of
``civilized'' bonhomie, human beings are vile.
</P>
<P>
   In all of these films you can sense a reckless millennial
fervor, an urgency to tear down everything and expose the
rottenness so that civilization can start all over again with a
clean slate.

EDITORIAL: MCGWIRE DOES IT!

  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``s'' news file.) 
(th)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept 9:
</P>
<P>
   With what seemed like the whole country in attendance, Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals drilled his 62nd home run into
the bleachers of Busch Stadium and into the history books Tuesday
night, breaking Roger Maris' 37-year-old mark of 61 homers in a
single season. It is possible that the man who has been shadowing
McGwire all summer, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, will overtake
him before the season ends Sept. 27. Yet whatever happens, this was
a joyful moment to be savored and celebrated, by McGwire and by
anyone who loves sports and baseball in particular.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a home run in his first at-bat as a 10-year-old
Little League player. He hit 49 home runs as a rookie in 1987 and
is the only player to hit more than 50 home runs three years in a
row. But what he has done this year is astonishing nonetheless.
Making solid contact with a small object traveling 90 mph is one of
the hardest tasks in sports, and to do it with consistency and
power is even harder. It is harder still when everyone seems to be
watching, and when the prize is the most venerated record in
American sports _ a record unrivaled, as our colleague Murray Chass
observed, for ``glamour, notoriety and its unyielding grip on the
American consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa show could not have come at a better time for
baseball, which has suffered from rudderless leadership, petulant
players, terrible labor relations and competition from other
sports. The home run chase has completely overshadowed the opening
of the football season and the national tennis championships, and
has filled thousands of seats in baseball stadiums that would
otherwise have been empty at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped, too, that both men are likable, modest men who
train hard and keep looking for ways to improve. When McGwire hit
his 61st on Labor Day, surpassing Babe Ruth, nobody seemed happier
than Sosa. The only question mark has been the controversy over
legal muscle-building supplements, especially in McGwire's case,
but the fans and his fellow players do not seem to care.
Supplements do not teach the art of hitting a baseball, and for
that reason cannot account for the fact that Mark McGwire has
become the most consistent home run hitter since Ruth. His is an
amazing accomplishment, and with any luck baseball can find ways to
build on it.

MCDOUGAL'S TRIAL STARTS WITH CHRONICLE OF FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ After months of delay, opening arguments
began here Tuesday in the embezzlement trial of Susan McDougal,
with a prosecutor telling jurors that President Clinton's onetime
partner in the Whitewater deal stole more than $150,000 from the
conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife in a ``crime of passion'' born
of frustration at her financial reverses in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   For years with her former husband, the late James McDougal, Mrs.
McDougal ``became accustomed to having lots of money, spending lots
of money and living a very high style of life,'' the prosecutor,
Jeffrey Semow, said. But with her marriage over and the couple's
finances ruined, Mrs. McDougal took a job in 1989 as assistant and
later bookkeeper for Nancy Mehta, and ``even though that money had
run out, the passion for it still survived,'' Semow added.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. McDougal listened impassively, Semow also accused her of
a crime of opportunity, like ``taking candy from a baby,'' because
Mrs. Mehta trusted her so completely to manage the couple's
financial affairs, signing complete books of personal checks, which
the prosecution says Mrs. McDougal then used for her own expenses.
Mrs. McDougal is also charged with forging Mrs. Mehta's signature
on checks and a credit card application, using her automatic teller
card without authorization and charging credit card purchases
without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, began his opening
statement late Tuesday afternoon by arguing that it was all a
misunderstanding and that most of the spending had gone to benefit
the Mehtas.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos began to detail the 32-year history of the Mehtas'
marriage, but Judge Leslie W. Light of Superior Court cut him off
sharply and cleared the courtroom of jurors and reporters for a
closed hearing, apparently concerned about whatever line of
argument the lawyer intended to pursue. For months, in interviews,
Geragos has contended that the charges against Mrs. McDougal were
political, brought in collusion with the Whitewater special
prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who held Mrs. McDougal in jail for
nearly two years on a contempt citation in an effort to induce her
to testify about Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But Light issued a pretrial ruling barring Geragos from making
that argument in the trial, and the judge reacted angrily when Mrs.
McDougal returned from a break in the ladies room and her lawyer
gave the court what appeared to be photocopies of articles she
reported finding tucked by the mirror about Richard Mellon Scaife,
a conservative millionaire who has been harshly critical of Clinton
and is under investigation for possibly influencing a major witness
in the Whitewater case. ''They have absolutely nothing to do with
the issues of this trial,'' Light said sharply. Apart from those
flashes of fire, the day was mostly given over to a detailed
chronicle by the prosecution of Mrs. McDougal's financial records.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mrs. McDougal could face up to seven years in
prison. She is already on probation from her 1996 conviction by
Starr for her role in fraudulently obtaining a $300,000 loan, some
of which later went to pay debts of Whitewater Development Co., in
which she and her husband were partners with Clinton and his wife,
Hillary. She also faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of a
still-pending charge of criminal contempt for her refusal to
testify before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, Mrs. McDougal has contended that she
operated with the Mehtas' approval and her lawyer has said Mrs.
Mehta knew about the credit card, and had agreed to the arrangement
as a way of providing extra compensation for Mrs. McDougal, who was
supposedly paid $3,200 a month as a personal assistant, plus $30 an
hour for bookkeeping work.
</P>
<P>
   But Semow said that as Mrs. McDougal's illicit spending grew out
of control, she had created false financial records in an effort to
explain her use of the credit card as payment for bookkeeping work
by a phony company she created, Paradise Bookkeeping. ``She went
back into the database, and as they say, cooked the books,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if Mrs. McDougal's claim is true, prosecutors
say, she failed to report use of the credit card as income, and as
a result she is also charged with three counts of state income tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Semow portrayed Mehta, the former conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic, as a musical genius
with no interest in his financial affairs, and described his wife,
Nancy, as ``a bit better,'' but still ``essentially clueless''
about business matters, which she delegated to others. Mrs.
McDougal went to work for them in 1989 after her boyfriend, Pat
Harris, left a job with them to go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from some other employees that Mrs. McDougal
appeared to be making unauthorized purchases, Semow said, Mrs.
Mehta continued to trust her until the summer of 1992 when she
returned from a trip to Italy and received an unexpected call from
the Bank of America asking whether she wanted to increase the
credit limit on a Mastercard held in her name, with Mrs. McDougal
listed as an alternate user.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first that Mrs. Mehta knew of such a card, Semow
said, though he acknowledged that she apparently used it herself a
few times, and when Mrs. McDougal could not provide adequate
explanation, she was dismissed.

   RAHWAY, N.J. _ There was oak all over Oak Street on Tuesday,
literally. And at the intersection of Maple and Elm, the mammoth
branch of a Norway maple that had once arched overhead, graceful
and leafy, had been rendered so much cordwood and leaf piles at the
curb in front of William Papirnik's house.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, said Papirnik, the city's former civil defense
director, it was one of those times when living on a tree-lined
street is more a curse than a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Downed tree limbs and power lines were the most visible signs of
destruction left by a line of violent squalls that swept through
this city, much of New Jersey north of Camden, and Nassau and
Suffolk counties on New York's Long Island on Monday. The storms
cut electricity to nearly 300,000 customers, but power had been
restored to all but 55,000 by late Tuesday, said utility spokesmen
in New Jersey and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The storms were blamed for one death in the Bronx, fatal boating
accidents off Long Island and Sandy Hook, and two other deaths
early Monday morning near Syracuse. Matthew D. Bernius Jr., 52, was
killed when his 19-foot sailboat capsized in the Atlantic Ocean
near Tanner Park in Copiague, N.Y. On the Jersey Shore, Joseph
Kaplaka, 56, of Newton was washed overboard while trying to return
his rented 12-foot motorboat to shore, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people in the metropolitan area, the storms were
notable for their speed and ferocity and for the tangle of debris,
school closings and rush-hour detours they left in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys taken by the National Weather Service on Tuesday
determined that at least two tornadoes spawned by the system
touched down briefly in New Jersey and that one struck Lynbrook in
Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County Emergency Services Manager Bill Fortier said
five towns _ Dunellen, Edison, Middlesex, South Plainfield and
Woodbridge _ had declared states of emergency because of widespread
power failures that knocked out traffic lights. The declaration
allows the towns to impose curfews to speed cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through 200 boxes of flares, thousands of
barricades and traffic cones,'' he said. ``But we're happy to say
that no shelters had to be opened. No one was put out of their
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools in more than half a dozen towns in Union and Middlesex
Counties, in central New Jersey, as well as those in Lynbrook were
closed Tuesday because buses could not negotiate streets littered
with tree limbs and power lines. And the guidance equipment that
helps pilots land at Teterboro Airport remained out of commission
after being struck by lightning during the storms.
</P>
<P>
   A downed tree knocked out power lines serving a 10-mile stretch
of railroad track between Red Bank and Matawan, said Steve Coleman,
a spokesman for the New Jersey Transit commuter line. The power
failure caused delays for about 14,000 morning commuters, who
boarded shuttle buses to detour around the stretch of dead track.
Coleman said New Jersey Transit expected to restore power by
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Syracuse, more than 120,000 Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation customers remained without power Tuesday as utility
crews worked to repair the damage caused by winds as high as 90
miles per hour that swept through the area early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the damage in New Jersey and on Long Island was to
power lines and connections serving blocks or single-family houses,
the upstate storms brought down bulk transmission lines over nine
counties, said Nick Ashooh, a Niagara Mohawk spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Eberwine, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service
station in Mount Holly, said that while most Syracuse-area
residents were asleep when the storm hit at 1 a.m. Monday, people
in the New York area had some warning as the skies darkened with
ominous, black clouds between 2 and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The squall line that swept through the area originated in
Pennsylvania and stretched about 100 miles from the Poconos south
to Philadelphia, he said. The fast-moving system traveled east
about 55 mph, and 15-mile-long storm cells had winds approaching 70
mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberwine said most of the storm's effects were the result of
``straight-line wind damage,'' although meteorologists had found
evidence of an F-1 tornado, capable of causing moderate damage from
swirling winds up to 112 m.p.h., at Clark, just north of Rahway.
They also detected an F-0 tornado, which has winds of up to 72
m.p.h. and could cause light damage, in Plainfield. The rankings
are based on the Fujita scale developed by a University of Chicago
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The damage ranged from the extreme and frightening to the minor
and merely puzzling. At the home of Joseph and Mary Peter on Oak
Street in Rahway, an uprooted oak tree crushed the enclosed sun
porch minutes after Peter had closed the windows and returned to
the parlor, 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Papirniks, on the other hand, had only a broken attic
window, some missing latticework and a damaged downspout.
</P>
<P>
   In North Plainfield, Hermina Sevilla's shiny red station wagon
lay crushed beneath an uprooted tree, while barely 50 feet away,
Walter Jones' spindly hibiscus plants and delicate Japanese maple
were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't even disturb the trash can tops,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in North Plainfield, traffic was barred from a stretch
of Somerset Avenue where power lines lay in the street and trees
rested against buildings. For Owais Choudharino, owner of the
Washington Avenue Deli and International Catering, business was bad
Monday and Tuesday as barricades diverted foot and automobile
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm meant more business for Anthony Cortese's Somerset
Sideline Bar, just across the street. When power was restored at 8
p.m. Monday, he saw a wave of customers eager to watch Monday night
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only bar for four towns where you could get a
beer,'' Cortese said.

3 SENATE CANDIDATES STRIVE TO RALLY SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Primary Day just a week away, the three
candidates for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate returned
to their strengths Tuesday, trying to rally key constituencies to
counter what has been a lackluster campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer brought out James Brady, the former White
House press secretary who was disabled during the assassination
attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, to champion his record
on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro held a news conference to draw
attention to her record and her stands on women's issues. Even as
she was doing so, the third principal candidate for the nomination,
New York City Public Advocate Mark Green _ who has also made a
strong appeal for the women's vote _ was telling a group of female
business owners that Ferraro does not deserve their support just
because she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece of comic political timing, Ferraro and Schumer each
scheduled news conferences Tuesday for City Hall Park, with hers
just wrapping up as his was beginning. But as they have throughout
the campaign, the two candidates ignored each other.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure visual drama, Schumer won the day, and sent
news cameras into overdrive, when he entered the park pushing
Brady's wheelchair. His speech still slurred by the bullet that
entered his brain and nearly ended his life 17 years ago, Brady
read an endorsement speech as Schumer stood behind him with head
bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm a Republican, have been all my life,'' Brady said.
``But in politics and in life, you have to help those who help you.
And nobody has helped us and New York more than Chuck Schumer. I
can honestly say that a lot of the reason that we have the Brady
law and the assault-weapons ban is because of this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was the sponsor of and driving force behind the 1993
Brady bill, which strengthened restrictions on handgun ownership.
The bill is the hallmark of Schumer's legislative career, and one
of the focal points of his candidacy. He was also instrumental in
the passing of the federal assault-weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's wife, Sarah, the chairwoman of Handgun Control, a
nonprofit group that lobbies for gun control, also offered an
impassioned endorsement. ``More than anybody,'' she said, ``I can
speak to this man's tenacity, commitment, his hard work. He is the
most amazing machine I've ever seen on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro countered with Ellen Malcolm, the president of Emily's
List, a national organization that supports female Democratic
candidates in favor of abortion rights by bundling campaign
contributions. The group has already raised a considerable amount
of money for Ferraro, although the campaign declined to specify how
much, and Ms. Malcolm pledged to do even more should Ferraro win
the chance to take on Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro became the first woman to run for vice president on a
major party ticket when the Democrats nominated her in 1984, and
she is clearly hoping that women will make their enthusiasm for her
felt at the polls. ``This is a race that could come down to women
really exercising their right to vote,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Ferraro on Tuesday cited her record on a range of
traditional women's issues: her creation of a special victims'
bureau to handle domestic violence cases and sex crimes when she
was a prosecutor in the Queens district attorney's office; her
defense of abortion rights, and her attempt to get a bill passed
mandating equal pay for equal work when she was in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what kind of a female voice that Al D'Amato puts
into his commercials, if you look behind the commercials and see
what he has done with reference to women when he votes
legislatively, you have to know he is not voting in our best
interests,'' said Ferraro, who has also been endorsed by the New
York chapter of the National Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   But in Green's speech to two dozen members of the National
Association of Women Business Owners, which he delivered at the
midtown Manhattan offices of Anchin, Block &AMP; Anchin, an accounting
firm, he said he had the strongest record among the candidates in
protecting women's rights. He cited his lobbying efforts to get
RU-486, the abortion pill, imported to the United States, his work
to expose price discrimination against women, and a bill before the
City Council that he co-wrote that would protect victims of
domestic abuse from discrimination at work if they need special
security accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   When he was consumer affairs commissioner, he said, he wrote a
report on bias against women by divorce lawyers that led the chief
judge of the state Court of Appeals, Judith Kaye, to impose strict
new regulations on divorce lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   After outlining his record, Green took on Ferraro. ``Now at the
beginning of this campaign, when Geraldine Ferraro announced her
candidacy, I concluded what counts more than gender is agenda,'' he
said. ``And I yield to no one my ardor and accomplishment in the
area of women's human rights and economic rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the three candidates stood behind a curtain and
described their records with their voices modulated to disguise
their sex, ``I would get the lion's share of support because of
agenda, not gender.''
</P>
<P>
   With all three candidates now doing extensive television
advertising, Ferraro perhaps best summed up the political mood.
``This is going to be an exciting race,'' she said. ``It is very
tight now.''

DESIGNS FOR STUDENTS, STARS AND TRAVELERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Naisbitt, the futurist, put it this way: When Asians like
something, they call it modern. When they don't, they call it
western. Since discouraging words are officially frowned upon in
Singapore today, it is fair to predict that the new campus of
Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic will be received as modern through
and through.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a safe bet that the crisp design of the campus will
not soon be marred by unsightly wads of chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by the New York firm Gwathmey Siegel &AMP; Associates, the
75-acre campus promises to be one of the most important of the many
works by American architects in southeast Asia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The campus, designed entirely from scratch, occupies a suburban
location, and up to 12,000 students, all commuters, are expected to
be registered in the next few years. The fields of academic
concentration include engineering, health care, business, and
communications technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gwathmey Siegel has approached this project with the concept
that buildings, too, play a pedagogical role. Campus architecture
is not just a container for classrooms, but is itself a vital form
of education.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson the architects intend to impart to Singapore students
is the value of community, a classical ideal extending from the
Greek gymnasium to the University of Virginia and beyond. Is it
possible to have modern architecture without western freedom? A
project important for the cross-cultural issues it raises and for
its lucid design.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eisenman's new design for the University of Arkansas
Football Stadium comes with built-in architectural pom-poms, huge
lollipop red ramps that leap into space and curl around the
stadium's rim.
</P>
<P>
   The project enlarges the existing stadium from 46,000 to 65,000
seats. The ramps, rising to 3,500 feet, are designed to unite the
stadium with a new student center.
</P>
<P>
   The associate architect is HNTB Sports Architecture. Eisenman,
who is not known to set great store by function, states that the
red superstructure will help cool the stadium by providing shade
and directing air currents. But they also show that his efforts to
undermine classicism often have the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charles Gwathmey, Eisenman was once part of the Whites, a
group of architects who sought to uphold the formal rigor of
European modernism. Their antagonists, known as the Grays (Charles
Moore, Robert A.M. Stern), followed Robert Venturi in arguing for
more accommodation of popular American taste.
</P>
<P>
   Both faced the breakdown of the Modern movement's solidarity.
Both grasped that with the collapse of Modernism, architects were
confronted with the loss of political leverage and esthetic
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   And both movements responded with essentially Baroque maneuvers
designed, like the architecture of the Counter-Reformation, to
demonstrate architecture's enduring relevance as a serious art
form.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Baroque took up historical pastiche and pop motifs, White
Baroque went with increasingly complex geometric abstraction. In
Arkansas, Eisenman's skyward ramps update Bernini, himself a great
cheerleader of an earlier day.
</P>
<P>
   Money, movies, missiles, malls and madness: the time approaches
when these may be the only first-rate items the United States will
continue to turn out for international consumption. There will be
nothing but one vast continental sprawl anchored by two buildings,
one on either coast: the Pentagon, and the new theater for the
Academy Awards on Hollywood Boulevard, which breaks ground this
fall. The missile mall and the movie mall, mad money-makers both.
</P>
<P>
   The new 3,500-seat theater, two blocks south of the Chinese
Theater, has been designed by David Rockwell in association with
Ehrencrantz Eckstut &AMP; Kuhn, and Altoon &AMP; Porter.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of entertainment architects out there, but
Rockwell is one of the few whose heart is in the right place. He is
madly in love with theater, and he has a strong and quirky vision
of the city's theatrical dimension.
</P>
<P>
   His Academy Awards theater features a facade of glass curtains,
a long promenade of a lobby and a three-tiered auditorium and
featuring glass boxes. The design, still in development, could
benefit from some noir Nathanael West effects: darker glass,
perhaps, a deeper chiaroscuro, for a city whose undercurrent of
menace, with luck, will never run dry.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the season belongs to Warren &AMP; Wetmore, architects
of Grand Central Terminal, and Beyer Blinder Belle, the firm that
has renovated and partly remodeled this classic chunk of New York,
which officially reopens on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It will be swell, it will be mobbed, but, as we walk through the
Concourse, the throngs may set some of us to humming the tune Fred
Astaire sings in ``The Band Wagon'' as he saunters along the
platform to board the 20th Century: ``I'll go my way by myself,
just I myself, alone.''

SUN AND MICROSOFT FACE OFF AT HEARING ON '96 JAVA PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(bl) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ On the morning of March 12, 1996, after
all-night negotiations to hammer out final details, principals from
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Microsoft Corp. signed a deal under which
Sun licensed its promising Java technology to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two companies, rivals again, squared off for a
three-day hearing in federal court to determine just what that
agreement meant. The resolution of the dispute could have
far-reaching implications for software makers and users.
</P>
<P>
   Sun contends that Microsoft has manipulated the Java programming
language to promote its stranglehold on the operating system
market. Microsoft, in turn, counters that Sun is using the
courtroom to accomplish what it cannot in the marketplace _ namely,
compete with Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   While the case is highly technical and esoteric, it could have a
wide impact. Sun has asked the government for a preliminary
injunction to prevent Microsoft from selling Windows 98 and the
Internet Explorer until it modifies the products to be Java
compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the first day of testimony, a Microsoft executive told
Judge Ronald Whyte of U.S. District Court in San Jose that a
preliminary injunction could impact ``thousands, if not tens of
thousands'' of software developers. ``If there was an injunction,
it would impact worldwide shipments,'' said Robert Muglia, senior
vice president of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Java is a programming language that can be used to develop
software for use across different operating systems. Java permits
users of these different operating systems to share and gain access
to the same programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sun contends that in 1996, Microsoft agreed it would create
versions of Java that maintained this essence of widespread
compatibility. Instead, Sun said that very soon after the agreement
was reached, Microsoft began releasing versions of Java to be used
to develop software exclusively for use on Microsoft operating
systems. Sun sued on Oct. 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, in light of the imminent release by Microsoft of
Windows 98, Sun asked the court to grant a preliminary injunction
that would be satisfied with one of three conditions: that Windows
98 include a fully compatible version of Java; that Microsoft
bundle Sun's version of Java with Windows 98, or that Microsoft
remove any incompatible programs from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials declined to comment today, noting that they were
scheduled to present evidence on Wednesday. In its motion filed on
May 14 seeking a preliminary injunction, Sun argued that
``Microsoft is drawing on its vastly superior distribution channels
for desktop operating systems and browsers to inundate the market
for desktop computers with an unlicensed, incompatible version of
Sun's Java environment,'' according to a statement by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The motion called the attempt, ``a blatant effort to devalue
Sun's technology and establish its own, corrupted version as a de
facto industry standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said in court today that it understood its agreement
with Sun to mean Microsoft would be allowed to effectively create
two versions of Java, one that passes Sun's test for widespread
compatibility, and one intended for use with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Muglia, the Microsoft executive, said Sun was unfairly trying to
control programming language that was essential to the Windows
operating system and that was outside the purview of the agreement.

SAM ROCKWELL: ONE-MAN GALLERY OF ROGUES, CROOKS AND ODDBALLS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Rockwell is a master of the quick change. The 29-year-old
actor showed his range in January at the Sundance Film Festival,
where he was featured in not one but three films. He appeared as
the romantic, James Dean-like outcast who mows lawns in John
Duigan's ``Lawn Dogs,'' which opened in May; he slouched across the
screen as a hilariously inept safecracker in John Hamburg's ``Safe
Men,'' which opened in July, and he delivered a chilling
performance as a car-salesman-turned-hitman in Saul Rubinek's dark
comedy ``Jerry and Tom,'' which will also be shown this month at
the Toronto Film Festival. ``Sam's got the juice,'' said Joe
Mantegna, his co-star in ``Jerry and Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his breakthrough role _ the lovable oddball Bucky in
Tom DiCillo's ``Box of Moonlight'' (1997) _ was quite recent,
Rockwell has been acting professionally since he was 18, playing
both character roles and quirky leading men, bridging comedy and
drama. He has appeared in more than 15 independent films and is now
wading into more mainstream movies as well _ including a role as a
hanger-on in the new Woody Allen film, ``Celebrity,'' which will
open the New York Film Festival on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has so far played a gallery of rogues, crooks and
outsiders, the actor himself has an unassuming sweetness and a
puckish sense of mischief. He is compact and agile, with a mop of
fly-away light brown hair and mobile, expressive eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping the first of several cappuccinos at a Greenwich Village
cafe near where he lives in Manhattan, he talked about his past and
present parts as if they were longstanding friends. Of Sam in
``Safe Men,'' he said, ``He's the most straight-ahead character
I've played, but even so he's a weirdo.'' Of Jerry he said, fondly,
``He's a goofball who doesn't know how to do anything that well.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jerry and Tom,'' he is required to age 10 years, from
callow incompetent to steely-eyed killer. In early screenings, some
audience members actually took a while to realize that the older
and younger Jerrys were the same actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was amazing about Sam was that the transformation wasn't
showy,'' said Rubinek, the well-known character actor who debuts as
a director with this film. ``It's so seamless that you hardly
notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a thread that binds Rockwell's work, it is his
fascination with anti-heroes. ``I like that dark stuff,'' he said,
cheerfully. ``I think heroes should be flawed. There's a bit of
self-loathing in there, and a bit of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, however, he gives an impression of originality rather
than alienation. Hamburg, the director of ``Safe Men,'' put it this
way: ``Sam is a free spirit. He's the only person I know who, when
he goes out to do a major studio movie in Los Angeles, rents a bike
instead of a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's attitude can be traced in part to his footloose
upbringing. He was born near San Francisco to parents who were both
actors, and who divorced when he was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation from an arts high school in San Francisco in
1987, he moved to New York and studied with William Esper, one of
Sanford Meisner's chief proteges. The theater is still his passion:
last season, he appeared Off Broadway as a Cockney salesman in Mike
Leigh's critically acclaimed play ``Goose-Pimples.''
</P>
<P>
   For his small role in ``Celebrity,'' Rockwell bleached his hair
blond. ``Only for Woody,'' he said demurely.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockwell's biggest coup is the film that he is currently
making, ``The Green Mile,'' based on the Stephen King novel. Set in
the South in the 1930s, it stars Tom Hanks as a prison guard and
features Rockwell, in his first major Hollywood role, as a death
row inmate. Immersed in preparation for this, Rockwell was carrying
Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood'' and Jack Henry Abbott's ``In the
Belly of the Beast'' in his knapsack.
</P>
<P>
   Of Wild Bill, he said, with relish: ``He's the quintessential
white-trash nightmare. But after this, I've really got to play some
lawyers, or a British aristocrat, or they'll put a label on me.''

RUSSIAN PSYCHODRAMAS MADE OF MOVEMENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boris Eifman's choreography, like his dancers, is
passionate and intense: his Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg gave
audiences a jolt when this 21-year-old Russian troupe made its New
York debut in April with provocative psychodramas about Tchaikovsky
and the ballerina Olga Spessivtseva.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eifman Ballet returns to City Center Jan. 19 through
31, it will be easier to see why Eifman's highly expressive use of
the ballet idiom is so dramatic and stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Karamazovs,'' his two-act treatment of Dostoyevsky's
``Brothers Karamazov'' is a distilled if graphic essay on the
novel's themes. The second new program is a double bill that
wrestles with life's mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiem,'' the first work, is set to Mozart's ``Requiem'' and
meditates on birth, maturity and death while the second ballet ``My
Jerusalem,'' was inspired by that city's places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   In Eifman's vision, colored by his use of percussive techno-rock
music, three religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) are
distinct but reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Red Giselle,'' his work about Spessivtseva, and
``Tchaikovsky,'' (both will be performed again), ``Requiem'' and
`My Jerusalem'' are plotless. I saw them in June, along with ``The
Karamazovs,'' when the Eifman Ballet, which uses various theaters
in St. Petersburg, performed there for the first time at the
Maryinsky (Kirov) Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary choreography has certainly been seen on that
hallowed stage, but the Eifman company is not the kind of official
opera-house troupe Americans usually see, like the Bolshoi and the
Kirov.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryinsky itself presented experimental productions at the
turn of the century and through the 1920s until Soviet officialdom
clamped down on artistic freedom. American impresarios like Sol
Hurok had similar conservative tastes. It was safer box office to
import 19th-century classics and occasional Soviet heroic-style
ballets.
</P>
<P>
   That Eifman, now 52, was part of a new generation of Russian
choreographers trying to express themselves with individuality was
unknown to Americans. Esthetically, that generation owed much to
Leonid Yakobson, an older choreographer who was often on the outs
with the Soviet cultural authorities but who taught at the
Leningrad Conservatory's choreography department.
</P>
<P>
   Eifman, a 1972 graduate, freelanced while choreographing for the
Kirov school. His present company is an outgrowth of a group
affiliated with the Leningrad Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has been inspired by literature. I also saw
his ``Don Quixote,'' in which the Don lives in an insane asylum.
``For many years,'' Eifman said, ``I felt I lived in a madhouse,
the Soviet Union. I was told, `You don't do Soviet ballets, why
don't you go away?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a ballet, this ``Don Quixote'' lacks coherence. But like the
pieces to be seen at the City Center, it suggests that spiritual
quest is a prime Eifman theme.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual images in some of Eifman's narrative productions
(tame by Kenneth MacMillan's standards) are not surprising. ``The
Karamazovs'' is a dark, powerful ballet, focused on the duel
between the flesh and the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   An orgy opens the work as the patriarch of the Karamazov clan
staggers from a striking two-tiered set toward the three cursed
brothers, who are entangled in a cat's cradle type of net.
</P>
<P>
   The saintly Aleksei is portrayed by Igor Markov, who ends by
climbing up toward a cross, seeking God. Earlier, he plays Jesus
opposite Albert Galichanin's Grand Inquisitor, in Eifman's symbolic
translation of Dostoyevsky's celebrated debate about God and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   To boil down philosophical discourse to a duet is a risk. But
Eifman makes his point through the expressiveness of his
choreography. Duets are his forte, and his two ballerinas, Vera
Arbuzova and Yelena Kuzmina, are especially fluent within a
marvelous group of dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is ensemble work that comes to the fore in the
double bill. The whole stage seems to tilt in the swiftly changing
patterns of ``Requiem.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Jerusalem,'' the soloists symbolizing the three
religions are absorbed into a commune that sails away on a rocking
gyroscope: part space ship, part Noah's ark.

`A CIVIL ACTION': THE STRESSES OF DISTILLING DRAMA FROM LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On the wintry, weedy grounds of an abandoned
psychiatric hospital outside Boston, John Travolta and Robert
Duvall locked bright blue gaze with pale blue gaze, breath steaming
in the cold as they engaged in a verbal dogfight befitting the two
lawyers they were playing in the film version of ``A Civil
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away on this day last December, the real-life Jerome
Facher, the wily, wise corporate litigator played by Duvall,
watched as the screen version of himself bit off a powdery chunk of
jelly doughnut and tried to intimidate Travolta's younger and
brasher character, Jan Schlichtmann, into settling his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it much better than I would,'' Facher observed of
Duvall. ``He's a way better actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, joking with the actor, he put it, ``You're a
better me than (italics)me!''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Disconcerting, isn't it? Art not only imitating life but besting
it, in the opinion of the subject who has been doing the actual
living.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction books and films always dance cheek to cheek with real
life, of course. But ``A Civil Action,'' a Disney movie that is to
open on Dec. 25, based on the acclaimed 1995 book by Jonathan Harr,
has an unusually, uncannily intimate relationship with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the success of the book
and potential success of the movie is this: In their depiction of a
cluster of leukemia deaths among children in the Boston suburb of
Woburn and the large-scale 1986 legal battle that ensued over
whether industrial pollution was to blame, the reality they convey
is not a comfortable or a simple one.
</P>
<P>
   There are no obvious, flawless heroes, though there are many
obvious victims; causes are complex, and mistakes are made by good
people. And the legal system emerges in shades of gray, somewhere
between justice and injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book has been on the best-seller list for about two
years, and the movie, with a budget of more than $60 million, is so
promising that it is already being mentioned in
entertainment-industry publications as a strong contender for
various Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Harr recalls that the book, which took him an excruciating nine
years and repeated extensions on his contract with Random House to
write, was a hard sell at first. ``It was a book about toxic waste
and a lawsuit that drags on and dead children,'' he said. ``And who
wants to read that?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the book was done, however, the movie rights were not a
hard sell at all. When Harr's agent began to offer the book around,
before it was even published, it set off a bidding war, and the
screen rights ended up being bought for $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Pfeffer, who was then president of Wildwood Enterprises,
Robert Redford's production company, started reading the book and
couldn't put it down. She ultimately left the company to commit
herself wholly to producing ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues told her that she was crazy, that the story was
too dark and complex. But, she said, ``I think people want what
this book had, and what the movie has as well, which is great guts,
great American guts _ emotion, passion, finally hubris. Like Jan's
partners, you go on this incredible roller-coaster ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she added, just the fact that Schlictmann ``gave up what
he gave up, that these families went through what they went through
_ it touches on so many different things.''
</P>
<P>
   To Travolta, the movie ``means a lot to everyone on different
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the backdrop, which is the environment, is a very
important issue,'' he continued, ``and it's also about characters
that arc and go through transitions. It could be a comment on a lot
of different things _ materialism, success, power, what one does
when that's taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Distilling that multilayered meaning into a two-hour movie fell
largely to Steven Zaillian, who wrote the screenplay for
``Schindler's List'' among other movies and was the director of the
successful 1993 film ``Searching for Bobby Fischer.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``A Civil Action,'' he is not only the writer and the
director but also one of the producers. Getting the script right
took two years, he said, and he purposely did not meet the
real-life characters until it was done.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie captures the spirit of reality so closely, he
said, that it sometimes even seems to blur with the principals'
memories of what happened. At one point, Zaillian said, he was
filming a scene in which Schlichtmann won a big case and did a
gleeful little dance outside a Boston courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   For stronger visual appeal, the scene was shot in Boston's
Public Garden rather than near the downtown courthouse where it had
really occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As Schlichtmann watched the filming, he said, ``This is exactly
what really happened,'' Zaillian recalled. ``And I said, `No, it's
not, Jan; I know what really happened.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The real Schlichtmann is unabashedly pleased at the shape of the
movie, which he consulted on for a reported fee of about $200,000.
He sees nothing too reality-bending in the fact that he is being
played by Travolta, even if the two are nothing alike physically.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta tends slightly to heft while Schlichtmann is all
narrow, rangy ectomorph. Schlichtmann has brown eyes that in the
book are described as earning him the nickname Spaniel Eyes;
Travolta's eyes are perhaps the bluest in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta has a fascinating languor to him; Schlichtmann, even
now in a much mellower, silver-haired, 47-year-old model, seems
kinetic and a bit turbulent, even when he talks about meditating.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Schlichtmann sees Travolta as capturing the spirit of his
younger self. ``I was awed at how he became a lawyer like I was,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schlichtmann has changed a great deal since he was the
Porsche-driving, Italian-suit-wearing, all-or-nothing lawyer whose
colorful personality convinced Harr that there was, indeed, a book
in the Woburn case, and who ended up bankrupt and battered and
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Now married and the father of two toddler sons, he divides his
time among several pursuits: starting up production companies,
making environment-oriented radio and television shows and working
on Woburn-like cases in New Jersey, Massachusetts and elsewhere.
Perhaps the most striking change, though, is that he now sees the
kind of take-no-prisoners litigation he practiced in the Woburn
case as a great mistake, and says as much at public speaking
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   It may make great drama, but such litigation is like war, he
said in an interview at his house on a seaside peninsula in the
Boston suburb of Beverly, where he cultivates an elaborate water
garden and works from a shingled studio just steps from the main
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came to appreciate how wasteful and destructive
litigation can be,'' he said. Now, he encourages ``problem
solving,'' through less confrontational, more peaceable, more
realistic talks between sides in a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann seems to have grown philosophical about many other
things as well _ for instance, the fact of being a public figure
who is about to become even more public but has had no direct
editorial control over how he was portrayed, either in the book or
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're passed around as property for others to examine
and analyze,'' he said, ``it forces you to accept yourself in all
your aspects. And when you lose your privacy over that, it's a
learning experience and it can give you many insights and also
great pain in learning those insights.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of real, relatively private lives into film
material did create a knotty problem for the makers of ``A Civil
Action,'' however.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, with filming set to start in Boston in the fall,
several members of the bereaved families who had sold the rights to
their story to another team of producers _ for a movie project that
never came to fruition _ complained that Disney was not involving
them in the production or compensating them.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes over rights to real-life stories have arisen
before: notably, Geoffrey F. Bowers, a lawyer with AIDS who fought
his dismissal from work, accused the makers of the 1993 movie
``Philadelphia'' of stealing his story. Such conflicts seem likely
to become ever more common as enterprises seeking ``synergy''
between journalism and movies multiply.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the issue became so hot that legislators
passed a bill saying that filmmakers could not make movies about
people's lives without their permission. Advocates for Hollywood
protested loudly that such a law limited freedom of expression.
Massachusetts boosters like the acting governor, Argeo Paul
Cellucci, warned that filmmakers would stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The measure ultimately died, but Disney agreed to pay the
families several hundred thousand dollars, and to consult them more
in the production, though it stopped short of giving them any
editorial control.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dispute died down, it highlighted the unfortunate
effect even sensitively made books and movies can have in renewing
the pain for their real-life subjects. On one hand, the eight
Woburn families had badly wanted their story told, and that was why
they gave such full access to Harr, and to journalists in general.
And for many, that is still the main thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, people will continue to just be aware of what's
going on in their cities or towns or farmland,'' said Donna
Robbins, a nurse whose 9-year-old son Robbie died of leukemia.
``Because it's everywhere, it's not just in Woburn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Anderson, whose son Jimmy was 12 when he died of
leukemia, said that the success of the book and the making of the
film have served to reopen her wounds and remind her of her lack of
control over how she, and especially her son, have been depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, who is played in the movie by Kathleen Quinlan,
said she thought her son was portrayed as ``weak and whiny'' in the
book, and ``that just wasn't so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting to see what the movie focuses on,'' she said.
``It's frightening. I don't own the story; I don't own anything
they're going to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer, the movie's producer, said that Jimmy would not be
featured at all because the story starts after his death. But she
and Zaillian had no simple answers for the anxieties of the
subjects of such nonfiction films, other than their own commitment
to treat their characters right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the only control they have is having the material in
the right hands,'' Ms. Pfeffer said, referring to the families. ``I
really don't think there is anyone who will feel they were not
treated with dignity, respect and just a lot of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Facher did not seem to mind when Duvall
affectionately derided him as ``an animal _ an animal! _ in the
courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, playing again with the idea of having a cinematic
doppelganger, he sounded grateful just to be allowed to hang around
the set and watch himself be portrayed by a gifted actor. ``I
wouldn't let me near me, if I were playing me,'' he declared.

CROSSING THE GAP FROM ENGLISH TO AMERICAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early one Sunday evening recently, the writer and
director Peter Chelsom could be found on the back patio of his
rented Bel-Air home, revealing a modest dream: ``One day, I would
love to be sitting on an airplane, and someone will say, `What do
you do for a living?' And I'll go, `Well, I'm a director,' and
they'll go, `Oh, anything I may have seen?' '' Then, Chelsom will
list his credits and a look of recognition will creep over his
seatmate's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' said Chelsom, 42, ending his reverie, ``to
direct films that your average Joe would have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a cut-and-dried fantasy for one whose movies can
be so otherworldly. It has been 12 years since Chelsom abandoned
his career as a top stage and television actor so that he could put
his imaginative stamp on three films about his childhood in
Britain: ``Treacle'' (1987), a short; ``Hear My Song'' (1991) and
``Funny Bones'' (1994). All three won grand-prize awards from
film-festival jury committees and attracted urgent calls from
big-shot Hollywood agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once rang me from the lobby of Lincoln Center and
said: `We want to represent you. Please! We'll pay to fly you
over,' '' recalled Chelsom, who passed on that free ticket as
quickly as he did offers from major studios to direct glitzy
romances like ``A Walk in the Clouds.'' ``I thought I wasn't
qualified,'' said Chelsom, who was concerned that his British
perspective wouldn't mesh with stories that originated in America.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the producer Jane Starz sent Chelsom a
screenplay set in a blue-collar neighborhood of Cincinnati, she was
such a fan of his past work that she could easily have fulfilled
his recognition-on-an-airplane fantasy. But she couldn't have known
that his very personal response to the screenplay, ``The Mighty,''
would address his anxieties about accurately capturing a foreign
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a kid from the north of England, so I could just
treat it the way I would a working-class English story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on his first viewing of a rough cut of ``The
Mighty,'' which is to open Oct. 9, Chelsom turned to his editor and
paid himself his highest compliment, feeling he had bridged a
cultural gap: ``My God! This could have been directed by an
American!''
</P>
<P>
   But even he admitted that if he had heard the plot synopsis
before reading the script, which was based on ``Freak, the
Mighty,'' the popular 1993 novel for teen-agers by Rodman
Philbrick, it could well have ended up in his reject pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, if someone asked me, `Do you want to make a film
about a crippled kid and a big kid and at the end the crippled kid
dies?,' I would have said, `No, not at all,' '' said Chelsom. ``But
my rule of thumb has always been, `Does it move me?' And it moved
me very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted for the screen by Charles Leavitt, ``The Mighty,'' is
about the friendship between two 13-year-old boys: Kevin, a tiny,
physically handicapped genius (Keiran Culkin. brother of Macauley),
and Max, his learning-disabled, extra-large-size neighbor (Eldon
Henson).
</P>
<P>
   During their time together, this odd couple come to rely on each
other in various metaphorical ways. But when distractions come,
they're in the form of real-life nightmares: the boys are chased by
knife-wielding teen-age toughs, and Max's father (James
Gandolfini), a savage ex-convict, returns to haunt his son.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the film is neither traditional adult fare nor
something that parents will rush off to with their young children.
In other words, it isn't going to be the easiest movie to sell, and
it wasn't the easiest project to sell to someone like Harvey
Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, which financed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more than resistant at first,'' said Weinstein. ``It's
hard to market a movie that appeals to all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it looked like it may not happen,'' said Chelsom.
But then, he said, there was a pivotal meeting in which he played a
song performed by the Chieftains, the Irish folk group, for
Weinstein. ``I think the music struck an emotional chord in
Harvey,'' Chelsom said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein gave the go-ahead, and he also suggested that Chelsom
get Sharon Stone to bring her movie-star wattage to the role of
Kevin's radiant mother. Miramax's input didn't end there, but who
exactly it was who gave subsequent suggestions is more of a
mystery. Whenever Chelsom's conversation turned to the production
of ``The Mighty,'' he displayed an affection for nonspecific,
gender-resistant pronouns: ``When they say to you, `You can't do
that,' '' said Chelsom, about how they sometimes reacted to his
sometimes fantastical style, ``you have to say to them, `Does
anyone have a problem with Chauncey Gardiner walking on water at
the end of ``Being There''?' You actually have to say this to them
at the end of meetings: `The things you can do are not the things
that people are interested in seeing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An example: Early in ``The Mighty,'' Max and Kevin are walking
across a bridge in contemporary Cincinnati when they are suddenly
flanked by a group of King Arthur's knights, complete with clanking
armor, on head-tossing steeds. Chelsom's authority figures believed
that the central characters should acknowledge their medieval
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   But Chelsom argued that it should instead be shot as if they are
unseen by anyone but the audience. In the end, it's a strangely
magical moment, characteristic of the distinctive sort of real
feeling Chelsom evokes with his beguilingly romantic style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a difficult struggle for directors like Peter,''
said Chelsom's friend Adrian Dunbar, who starred in and helped
write ``Hear My Song,'' about a nightclub owner who tries to clear
things with his girlfriend by tracking down a legendary Irish
tenor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar sees all of Chelsom's outsider heroes as men who come to
realize that ``there is a payoff in life for doing something for
nothing, for being generous.'' ``As far as I'm concerned,' Dunbar
added, ``the sooner we all get used to Peter's particular vision of
the world, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, much of Chelsom's particular vision was informed
by his upbringing in Blackpool, an English seaside resort that
specializes in tacky show business. Vaudeville entertainers are
part of the earliest memories of the youngest of Kay and Reginald
Chelsom's two sons, who saw them up close as they examined
knickknacks at his parents' antique shop and from afar when saw
their shows.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsom never formally studied filmmaking, but virtually
everything in his early life prepared him to be a movie director.
From watching the variety acts, he learned that good comedy is
precise comedy. From being an amateur photographer, he learned to
see everything as if it were framed by a viewfinder. And getting
through the day taught him what it's like to feel an apartness.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a filmmaker, Chelsom spent three years studying
at the Central School of Drama in London. Over the next decade, he
appeared in Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theater
productions, taking his bows alongside distinguished colleagues
like Nigel Hawthorne and Anthony Hopkins. ``It was a boringly
respectable career,'' said Chelsom.
</P>
<P>
   Just at the height of his fame, he scrapped everything to write
and direct the 11{-minute ``Treacle.'' His past as an actor does
serve him well, though. ``I had the best training,'' he said,
``which is nice because I have a whole ragbag of ways of working
with any actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting there in blue jeans and a loose T-shirt, Chelsom could
have passed for a lanky Southern Californian ex-surfer, were it not
for his English accent and comportment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes him a while to warm up,'' said Gillian Anderson, the
star of television's ``X-Files,'' who in ``The Mighty'' is nearly
unrecognizable as a Southern boozer who wears a red, Dolly
Parton-style wig and loads of mascara. ``But Peter has this spark
inside of him that is just contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   So taken was Ms. Anderson with Chelsom and ``The Mighty'' that
Weinstein asked her ``to cultivate it with her fans.'' Since then,
Ms. Anderson has done everything but spell out Chelsom's name in
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone, an executive producer of ``The Mighty,'' has also
helped promote the film, although her location of choice was
decidedly more glamorous than cyberspace. Last May, at the Cannes
Film Festival, Ms. Stone was host for a special not-for-competition
screening of ``The Mighty.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was stuck in Los Angeles, working on his latest film,
``Town and Country,'' starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and
Goldie Hawn, Chelsom got no closer to that event than reading the
Variety review, which said, `` Chelsom's offbeat sensibility finds
voice in a story that demands extremes of triumph and tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I missed one of life's perfect moments,'' said
Chelsom, who would have loved to have seen the black-tie audience
give ``The Mighty'' a 10-minute standing ovation. Perhaps he would
have also enjoyed it when Ms. Stone volunteered at a Cannes news
conference that she wasn't proud of her behavior during filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that she admitted in Cannes that she gave me a hard
time,'' said Chelsom, who gallantly added, ``She wasn't that bad.''
Nonetheless, the two haven't spoken since Ms. Stone finished her
12-day stint on location in Toronto, and Ms. Stone doesn't seem in
a hurry to share her thoughts about Chelsom. ``She has a very full
plate right now,'' said her publicity agent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chelsom has a plate to think about as well. First,
he'll complete ``Town and Country,'' a big-budget midlife-crisis
comedy that has shown Chelsom why all that cash is needed for
top-dollar studio productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much time dedicated to the catering, and
assistants running around, and the faxing of maps, and the calling
of agents because someone is not supposed to work that day,'' said
the director.
</P>
<P>
   And during all this, Chelsom will be expected to help sell ``The
Mighty,'' although he knows from experience that it's best not to
get too hopeful that this will be The One. ``It's painful to get
too involved,'' he said. ``There's so much hype, and you start to
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his thoughts about the future are primarily on ``The
Freddie Randall Story,'' a World War II-misfits movie that he and
Dunbar have been commissioned to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all dropouts _ overweight, with flat feet or eczema,''
the director said. ``We could make it for $5 million.'' By which he
meant that he, his longtime producer, Simon Fields, and Dunbar
would be the only they involved. ``I yearn to do something that's
uncomplicated.''

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The American Embassy here was an easy target
for terrorists. Its perimeter was patrolled by unarmed guards
earning about $100 a month. The embassy's parking lot, shared with
a bank, had an exit lane protected by neither guards nor
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, attackers in a truck packed with explosives turned
off Haile Selassie Avenue and roared up that lane, flashing past an
uninstalled security barrier that the bank was planning to erect to
protect the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The truck managed to drive close to the building, where it was
stopped by an unarmed private security guard at a barrier at the
entrance to an underground garage. The guard ran when the attackers
threw a grenade-like device at him.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of the Nairobi bombing, based on interviews
with guards and other witnesses, shows that the embassy was
vulnerable to the most rudimentary attack.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the State Department vowed to tighten the
security of its embassies around the world, the interviews suggest
that the Nairobi mission failed to meet what appears to be a basic
security requirement: controlling access to the parking lot behind
its building.
</P>
<P>
   And Nairobi is not alone. An administration official in
Washington said it was common for embassies to be near private
property with security precautions left to the local owners. In
Malaysia, the embassy was next to a gas station. After the bombings
in Africa, the official said, the U.S. government bought the gas
station and immediately emptied its tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a typical problem for us,'' the official said. ``We
have a number of situations in which we share commercial parking
lots.''
</P>
<P>
   The House International Relations Committee plans to hold
hearings this month on the Nairobi car bombing and the simultaneous
bombing of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will examine a number of security issues,
including why the exit lane was left vulnerable to terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 18 months, the American ambassador to Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, repeatedly complained to her superiors in
Washington about the lack of security at her embassy, and the
committee wants to know whether she specifically raised questions
about access to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said the embassy in Nairobi did not
request any money to secure the road leading out of the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it would have made a difference,'' said one embassy
official, who like most of the U.S. officials interviewed for this
article spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``If we had had
control of that outside parking lot and more guardposts, they would
have gone somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. embassies around the world employ unarmed guards from
private security companies rather than armed guards or soldiers to
handle day-to-day security outside the building. U.S. Marines
normally control access to embassy buildings and protect classified
documents, and handle security problems within the embassy itself.
But external security is often handled by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion here on Aug. 7, U.S. officials initially
praised the guard company, United International Investigative
Services, which is based in Anaheim, Calif. The officials pointed
out that the two Kenyan guards at the rear gate of the embassy's
underground garage had refused to allow the van carrying the bomb
to enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vehicle had gotten down that parking ramp, none of us
would be talking to you,'' said one high-ranking embassy official.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial praise for the guards, who all survived the
blast, did not address why the terrorists had such an easy time
driving up to the barrier at the top of the ramp leading into the
embassy garage, coming close enough to gut the embassy building and
kill three dozen people inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to several witnesses, the Mitsubishi Canter van
carrying the bomb entered the parking lot through an exit lane
leading out to Haile Selassie Avenue. There was no barrier there to
stop the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy shared the rear parking lot with the adjacent
Cooperative Bank, U.S. officials said. The bank employed guards
from Wells Fargo Co., who controlled a barrier at the entrance of
the parking lot 50 yards to the north. The entrance was on an
access road that ran parallel to the avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had hired a contractor to install a cantilevered bar
barrier, like those used at railroad crossings, across the exit
lane, but the work had not yet been completed, U.S. officials said.
The useless barrier was laying on the ground the day of the attack,
several guards said. State Department officials said they had no
plan to build a security barrier controlling access to the rear of
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a barrier, the exit ramp was supposed to be guarded
by one of the embassy's private security guards in the parking lot,
the guards said in interviews. But the guard on duty that day near
the mouth of the exit lane, Jomo Matike Boke, did nothing to stop
the van from entering, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Boke's failure was not surprising, since he was filling in for a
sick colleague and had never performed the assignment before, the
guards said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the bombing, William Guidice, president of
United International Investigative Services, said the truck
carrying the bomb had first tried to enter a parking lot at the
front of the building, claiming to have a delivery for the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Guidice maintained that the guard turned the truck away from the
front lot and told the men inside to go around to the back gate to
make the delivery. The guard, Francis Emomeri, declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI investigators and embassy officials now say they doubt
that story. No witnesses have been found who saw the truck come to
the front of the embassy, law-enforcement officials said, though at
least one witness has told investigators he saw a second car
leading the van toward the embassy before the blast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the van was headed east on Haile
Selassie Avenue when it abruptly made a hard left turn, bounced
over a curb, then slipped through the exit lane and into the
parking lot, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Benson Okuku Bwaku was the guard manning the barrier leading
into the underground garage. He said he saw the 3.5-ton Mitsubishi
Canter truck with a covered cargo bay turn off the avenue and speed
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier was up, Okuku Bwaku said, because he had just
allowed a three-wheeled mail cart, driven by an embassy worker
named Francis Kile, to pass out of the embassy's garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel something in my blood that the van was unusual,''
he recalled. ``I asked Kile to move his cart quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck would have reached the barrier in seconds had a white
sedan not pulled out of another parking garage under the
Cooperative Bank Building across the lot from the embassy, he said.
The sedan ended up nose to nose with the van and for a minute
neither could move.
</P>
<P>
   Okuku Bwaku said he saw a man jump from the passenger side of
the van. Feeling panicked, the guard pushed the barrier down and
fastened it to the post. When he looked up, the man was next to
him, about six feet away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was black-skinned with Arab features, long sideburns and
fine, straight black hair that hung down to the middle of his neck,
the guard said. He wore a plaid shirt and grey, denim cargo pants
with large pockets on the thighs. His hands were in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said was: `Open the gate.' Not loud. Not soft,'' Okuku
Bwaku recalled. ``I did not talk to him. The barrier was down. He
pulled his hands out of his pockets. In his left hand he had what
looked like a hand grenade. In his right hand he had three objects
with three strings falling from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The man hurled the grenade-like device at Okuku Bwaku's head
with his left hand, the guard said. He ducked. The grenade landed a
few yards behind him and exploded near a car in the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Okuku Bwaku ran about 25 feet toward Haile Selassie Avenue and
stopped. He said he desperately tried to radio the Marine guard at
post one, a bulletproof control room in the reception area of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break! Base! Terrorism! Terrorism!'' he said he shouted into
the radio. The attacker threw a second device at him. It sailed
over him and exploded in a paved plaza surrounding the embassy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the drop barrier there was an iron fence and a pair of
heavy steel gates, through which cars had to pass to enter the
garage. As Okuku Bwaku ran toward the avenue, a second guard, Joash
Okindo, locked the steel gates with a padlock. He was critically
injured in the blast that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the embassy, Cpl. Samuel Gonite was on guard in the post
one control room. Like the other six Marines at the embassy that
day, he declined through a military spokeswoman to be interviewed
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokeswoman, Maj. Mary Baldwin, said the corporal was
not aware of the fracas at the back gate until the first grenade
exploded. She said he immediately checked the monitors connected to
cameras on the roof but saw nothing unusual. He told his superiors
he looked outside to see if the noise might have been a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Baldwin said the corporal was trying to make one of the
roof-top cameras pan around to the rear parking lot when the second
car bomb exploded. He either did not receive or did not hear Okuku
Bwaku's frantic radio transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, his focus was not on the radio, but on getting
the embassy secure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Okuku Bwaku was running for his life. He ran around the
corner of the embassy, intending, he says, to sprint to the
post-one control room and alert the Marines. He had gone about 15
yards when the car bomb exploded, sending him flying to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Baldwin said Gonite recalled a 10-second delay between the
first grenade and the big explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A seismograph at the University of Nairobi Geology Department
registered a small tremor at 10:39 and 20 seconds. Eight seconds
later, it registered a shockwave from the explosion that measured
3.4 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   Though Okuku Bwaku never saw the truck move closer to the
parking lot ramp, another guard on duty nearby did.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, who asked not to be identified, said he was standing
near the outlet ramp of the parking lot, when the delivery truck
made a sharp turn off Haile Selassie and into the parking lot,
moving fast.
</P>
<P>
   He described the truck as a late model, cream-colored one with a
Dubai license plate on the back fender. He saw the truck squeeze
past the sedan and approach the barrier just after the man who had
leaped from the passenger side threw a grenade at Okuku Bwaku.
Law-enforcement officials say the driver of the truck was killed in
the explosion. It is unclear how many other terrorists were present
when the bomb went off or how many were involved in the bombing
conspiracy, they said. Some witnesses have reported seeing another
man climb out of the back of the van.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Richardson, a former military policeman who is one of
the partners in the guard company, said the guards receive about 80
hours of classroom training and 40 hours of practical training
before being put on the job. The company also gives frequent
refresher courses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach them about terrorism and the things they should look
for,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson acknowledged it was virtually impossible for
unarmed guards to stop armed men from driving a car filled with
explosives up to the rear of the embassy, especially given the lack
of physical barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in that location,'' he said. ``You get very little
forewarning about what's taking place or what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that particular area, with unarmed security officers, it's
hard to protect something like that, or even to put a lot of fear
into anyone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he and his partners had applied for permission
to start an armed-guard service last year, but the Kenyan
government had turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said it would have been possible to employ
armed guards at the embassy _ several banks in the neighborhood do
_ but until the attack last month, the potential threat to the
embassy did not seem high enough to warrant armed patrols.
</P>
<P>
   A security official at the embassy, who asked not to be
identified, said even with better-trained guards, the embassy would
be difficult to protect because of its location.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story chancery sits at the corner of the city's two
busiest avenues and heavy pedestrian traffic flows around it
constantly, like water over a stone in a creek.
</P>
<P>
   The building has precious little setback on any side, and the
parking lots at the front and rear come up within a few meters of
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location of that building from a security standpoint is a
nightmare,'' the official said. ``It should have been moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said the U.S. ambassador, Ms. Bushnell,
renewed her complaints several times about the lack of security,
recommending at least twice in writing that the chancery be moved
to a new location.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year and a half that she's been here she's been
fighting with Washington to get us out of that building,'' a close
aide to Ms. Bushnell said. But the answer came back from Washington
that there was no money available for a new embassy, and the old
building would be remodeled instead, embassy officials said. It
remains unclear whether the security system in the rear parking lot
was to have been changed in the planned renovation, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't anything that wasn't brought to Washington's
attention,'' another embassy official said. ``They told us to be
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, several guards from the United International
Investigative Services said they had not received adequate training
to counter a terrorist attack like the one on August 7.
</P>
<P>
   Some said their training had lasted only two weeks, rather than
a month as Richardson maintained. Bombs were covered, they said,
but only in a cursory way. In essence, they were taught to clear
the area when a suspicious package or suspected bomb is found, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   First hired in November 1996, the company receives about $1
million a year from the State Department to provide full-time
security at the embassy and about 180 official residences. The
contract requires 540 guards, who make about $83 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to live in slums without water or electricity, several
guards said the salary did not encourage them to risk their live
for the embassy, they said. What's more, their salaries were cut
recently, along with health benefits for their families and a daily
meal allowance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are getting is too little,'' said one guard, who asked
not to be named.

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The music is still playing and the beer is still
flowing, but three weeks into Russia's latest crisis, the good
times at the Chesterfield Cafe _ a popular watering hole for
Moscow's high-living young professionals _ are already running on
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the quietest night of the quietest week,'' said
Chesterfield manager Martin Bainbridge, who left London's night
club business two and a half years ago to take part in Moscow's
giddy expansion. ``For a week and a half, I have had people coming
in here, saying this is their last drink in Moscow. But it is worse
for the Russians, who are at the bottom, watching their ruble
literally disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil that has brought Russia to its knees is
taking a big toll on the small but visible middle class that arose
here on the wave of this city's boom, working for banks, real
estate and advertising agencies, start-up companies and Western
firms, and spent money like there was no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   It has also cut a swath through the class of foreign bankers,
brokers, traders, technicians and adventurers who came here to cash
in. Now that it is crashing, some are packing their bags.
</P>
<P>
   Until these recent weeks, Moscow's professional elite had been
insulated from Russia's economic ills. Their salaries _ paid on
time and in dollars, or at least pegged to the dollar _ were high,
in some cases higher even than Western standards. Their appetite
for the good things in life _ from expensive restaurants to
designer clothes _ changed the face of Moscow, giving it a flashy,
if sometimes vulgar, glow.
</P>
<P>
   Work in Moscow _ a city that to the rest of Russia seemed like
Disneyland, bursting with new high rises and untold riches _ was
easy to find, particularly for those Russians eager and able to
take advantage of their new-found freedom: unemployment,
officially, was less than 1 percent and that didn't count the
bustling gray economy, which has stubbornly persisted below the
radar of government tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in less than a month, all that has changed. ``It is as if
somebody came in and turned off the lights,'' said Igor Mikheyev, a
Russian television producer, who was informed Tuesday that his
studio's programs were being pulled off the air, as Russia's major
television channels cut back on daytime programming, due to a drop
in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news has come on like a steam roller. First came the
banking crisis, and the blocking of bank transactions, including
salaries and savings withdrawals. Then came the collapse of the
ruble, which has sent prices skyrocketing, and emptied the stores
and markets of imported goods. Then came salary cutbacks, and now _
with increasing frequency _ layoffs, or as some employers are
describing it, temporary unpaid holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Spending patterns have already changed drastically. Cash
registers are silent at Moscow's chic boutiques, the telephones are
quiet at foreign auto showrooms and travel agencies are reporting a
drop in bookings to Turkey and other vacation spots favored by
Russia's new middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive restaurants are seeing fewer diners, who, according to
one manager, are talking more and drinking less once they see the
exorbitant prices for imported wines and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   News on Moscow's rumor mill is traveling so fast, and the
country's condition is so grave, that no one is keeping up with the
statistics. By the estimates of one Moscow recruiting agency, about
60,000 professionals in Moscow have either been laid off, sent home
on temporary, unpaid leave, or seen their salaries cut by as much
as one third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting applications from all the banks, sometimes
entire departments,'' said Oleg Mayev, managing director of Normal
DL Consulting, a headhunting firm that recruits for top financial
and business companies. ``Our advice is simple: hold on to the job
you have, or be ready to take whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The tune has changed since the days when young, well-educated
Russians, with degrees and foreign languages, could take their pick
in an eager job market. ``It was really a mad situation,'' said
Michael Obermayer, chairman of the Eastern Europe division of
McKinsey &AMP; Co., the big management consulting firm, recalling how
he had to make a hard sell to convince Russians with business
school degrees, to accept the firm's standard salary of roughly
$100,000 a year. ``In the heyday here, Russian companies were
literally promising them the world. I spent hours telling these
applicants to invest in themselves, and not go for the quick
buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for many Muscovites, who scrambled in recent years to find
a foothold in their new world order, just hanging on has become
agonizing. Ludmila Salnikova, editor of Health, a monthly magazine
insert, has seen its pages cut and her staff cut by half. Her own
handsome $2,000 a month salary was also halved, and then cut again
as the ruble's value is just a third of what it was against the
dollar three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a state of shock,'' said Ms. Salnikova. ``We
will print this year's last edition in October, and after that _ we
don't know. There is complete silence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gloom has also settled in among Russia's foreign community,
particularly in the financial sector, which has been hard hit by
the collapse of the Russian stock market and the banking system's
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   MFK Renaissance, once the hottest of Moscow's investment firms,
this week laid off 170 people, or nearly 30 percent of its staff.
At United Financial Group, another Moscow-based investment firm has
also cut staff, and dropped its salaries by an average of 30
percent, with senior executives taking cuts of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign companies are also going ahead with layoffs,
trimming costs, and putting new projects on hold. Advertising
agencies have been particularly hard hit, as several major Western
companies have curtailed both television and print campaigns, some
because their warehouses have already been emptied of goods, others
because they are holding back to see which way the Russian economy
is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Western investors are battening down the hatches,
waiting for the current storm to pass. ``We had a staff of 320
people before the crisis, and paradoxically we now have 322,'' said
Nick Gordon-Smith, managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston,
which has reported big losses from its Russian investments. ``We
want to wait for the dust to settle, then evaluate what the
business opportunities here are. In the long term, it is obvious
that Russia is going to be here. And in the long term, we know we
are keeping an office here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in business,'' said Chris Abel-Smith, the British
general manager of Premier Video Film, a leading producer of
copy-righted videos in Russia, who closed down his production
facility temporarily as retail prices began to climb. ``Ultimately,
the demand is still there, and we are still well positioned to
carry on. But you can't produce a product in this environment when
you have to pay royalties in hard currency.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis began to hit his operations two weeks ago, Robert
Greco, an importer and distributor of Heineken beer, moved quicker
than others, laying off about one half of his staff of 150,
renegotiating office and warehouse leases, even as his profits and
payments were held up in the quagmire of the Russian banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of his customers, Greco is now looking to shift to
Russian-produced beers, which are now selling at less than one half
of the price of imports.'' It just means taking a big step
backwards,'' he said. ``It is hardest on the consumers _ a middle
class that was just emerging, and starting to enjoy the imported
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Greco was nursing his beer at Chesterfield, where Bainbridge has
also had to adjust his business, and his menu, to the crisis.
Shepherd's pie and fish-and-chips, made from local products, have
substituted for T-bone steaks, imported from France. The
restaurant, which used to be open around-the- clock, now opens at 6
p.m. and closes at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The empty chairs and gloomy atmosphere are a far cry from the
old days, when Russians and foreigners, flush with cash, would drop
by on their nightly round of Moscow's lively night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is a party town,'' said Bainbridge, ``There are a lot
of young go-getting people in Moscow. In London, people go to clubs
once, twice a week. Here they were going five times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's over,'' echoed another Englishman, a
telecommunications expert who has already bought his ticket home
Friday flight, bailing out of what he sees as a painfully botched
business opportunity. ``But it was good while it lasted, wasn't
it,'' added his drinking companion, before the two ducked out the
door without giving their names.

BIG BANG: MCGWIRE BREAKS BASEBALL'S HOMER RECORD
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo of McGwire and two graphics are being sent to NYT
photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire made the most out of the least Tuesday
night, setting major league baseball's home run record by hitting
his 62nd and shortest home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging at the first pitch from Steve Trachsel of the Chicago
Cubs with two outs in the fourth inning, McGwire lined a low-flying
shot that just cleared the left-field fence near the corner where
the stands meet the foul line. The drive, hit at 8:18 Central
Daylight Time, was estimated at 341 feet, 6 feet shorter than
McGwire's previous shortest this season. He has hit five home runs
longer than 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed-hitting first baseman for
the St. Louis Cardinals, broke the tie with Roger Maris that he had
forged only the day before. In 1961, Maris hit his 61st home run in
the Yankees' 163rd and last game of the season. This was the
Cardinals' 145th game.
</P>
<P>
   The home run set off a wild scene at Busch Stadium, starting
with McGwire's dance to first base on which he missed the base and
had to be told by Dave McKay, the Cardinals' first-base coach, to
touch it. As McGwire rounded the bases, the Cubs infielders
congratulated him, and when he reached home plate, Scott Servais,
the Cubs' catcher, shook his hand and then they embraced. Minutes
later, Sammy Sosa, who has been challenging McGwire in the home run
record chase, ran in from right field and went to McGwire, who
picked him up before they embraced.
</P>
<P>
   One home run away from breaking the record, McGwire on Tuesday
picked up the bat that Maris used to hit his record-breaking homer
in 1961, rubbed the barrel of the bat across his broad chest and
said, ``Roger, you're with me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has spoken in recent days of communicating with
Maris and Babe Ruth after he dies, came together with Maris' bat
two hours before the start of the Cardinals-Cubs game. McGwire tied
Maris' record by clubbing his 61st home run on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire entered Tuesday's game leading Sosa by three. The Cubs'
right fielder had not hit a home run since he reached 58 Saturday
night in Pittsburgh. In the Cardinal clubhouse before Tuesday's
game, Delino DeShields, their second baseman, walked over to the
mirror where the lineup card was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the Hall of Fame card?'' he asked no one in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The card had been made out by Rene Lachemann, the team's
third-base coach, in the absence of Manager Tony La Russa, who was
on his way back from his mother's funeral. La Russa was in the
dugout by the time the two rivals batted in the first inning.
Facing Kent Mercker after Mark Grace singled home a run, Sosa
rapped a single past third base, leading to a second Cubs run.
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's turn at bat in the Cardinals' half of the inning,
Steve Trachsel threw the first three pitches out of the strike
zone, much to the noisy consternation of the fans in a sold-out
Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With camera flashes exploding all over the park, McGwire, given
a green light instead of the take sign usually signaled on a 3-0
count, swung at the pitch and hit a grounder to shortstop Jose
Hernandez, who threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa batted again in the third inning and again hit a grounder
toward third. But this time, Fernando Tatis scooped up the ball and
started an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Sosa and McGwire met separately with two
officials from the Hall of Fame, Donald Marr Jr., the president,
and Jeff Idelson, the executive director of communications and
education. Marr and Idelson explained to the players what sort of
items they would be interested in obtaining for the Hall's display
on the greatest home run race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Marr and Idelson brought with them the bat with which Maris hit
his 61st home run against Tracy Stallard on Oct. 1, 1961, the last
day of that season. Both players, Idelson said, took the bat and
swung it. ``We wanted to share it with them,'' Marr said.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire swung it, Idelson related, he went one step more,
rubbing it on his chest and putting into words the sentiment he
expressed Monday after he tied Maris.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his 61st homer on Monday, McGwire pointed to the
Maris children, who were sitting in the stands near the St. Louis
dugout, pointed skyward and tapped his heart, letting them know
that their father, who died in 1985 at the age of 51, was in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, did not act as demonstratively with the bat
as McGwire did, but he was surprised to learn that Maris' bat was
the same weight, 32 ounces, and the same length, 34{ inches, as
his. McGwire uses the same weight bat, but his is half an inch
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the conversations with the players, Marr and Idelson
were confident they would have a solid representation for the Hall
in Cooperstown, N.Y. ``Mark said what he has been saying publicly
all along,'' Idelson said after a seven-minute meeting with
McGwire. ``He would be generous. He is certainly cognizant of his
role in history, and he'd like to see his achievements documented
where they should be, at the Hall of Fame. We're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did not give the Hall officials any items at the
meeting. He said earlier in the week that he uses the same bat
until he breaks it, and the one he took into Tuesday night's game
had been responsible for his last six home runs, Nos. 56 through
61.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, on the other hand, turned over the bat he used in hitting
his 57th home run, the one that broke Hack Wilson's club record.
Sosa previously gave the Hall the bat he used to break the record
for the most home runs hit in the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, was like McGwire in being aware of the
significance of his role in the chase for the home run record and
wanted it to be documented as well.
</P>
<P>
   In handling Maris' bat, Sosa was surprised, Idelson said, that
it was in such good condition for a 37-year-old bat. The Hall
received the bat and the ball Maris hit for No. 61 from Maris in
1973. The Hall also has the bat and ball from Ruth's 60th home run
in 1927. Ruth's bat was much bigger than the others, 40 ounces and
35\ inches.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa reached this juncture after a spirited contest
to see who could get to the record first. McGwire held the lead
except for two and two-third innings in a game between the
Cardinals and the Cubs on Aug. 19. Sosa hit his 48th in the fifth
inning of that game, but McGwire matched him in the eighth and went
ahead with a game-winning home run in the 10th. Sosa had not caught
up since.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was new this season to the home run stratosphere of the
50s, having hit a career high of 40 in 1996.

 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire made the most out of the least Tuesday
night, setting major league baseball's home run record by hitting
his 62nd and shortest home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging at the first pitch from Steve Trachsel of the Chicago
Cubs with two outs in the fourth inning, McGwire lined a low-flying
shot that just cleared the left-field fence near the corner where
the stands meet the foul line. The drive, hit at 8:18 Central
Daylight Time, was estimated at 341 feet, 6 feet shorter than
McGwire's previous shortest this season. He has hit five home runs
longer than 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed-hitting first baseman for
the St. Louis Cardinals, broke the tie with Roger Maris that he had
forged only the day before. In 1961, Maris hit his 61st home run in
the Yankees' 163rd and last game of the season. This was the
Cardinals' 145th game.
</P>
<P>
   The home run set off a wild scene at Busch Stadium, starting
with McGwire's dance to first base on which he missed the base and
had to be told by Dave McKay, the Cardinals' first-base coach, to
touch it. As McGwire rounded the bases, the Cubs infielders
congratulated him, and when he reached home plate, Scott Servais,
the Cubs' catcher, shook his hand and then they embraced. Minutes
later, Sammy Sosa, who has been challenging McGwire in the home run
record chase, ran in from right field and went to McGwire, who
picked him up before they embraced.
</P>
<P>
   One home run away from breaking the record, McGwire on Tuesday
picked up the bat that Maris used to hit his record-breaking homer
in 1961, rubbed the barrel of the bat across his broad chest and
said, ``Roger, you're with me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has spoken in recent days of communicating with
Maris and Babe Ruth after he dies, came together with Maris' bat
two hours before the start of the Cardinals-Cubs game. McGwire tied
Maris' record by clubbing his 61st home run on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire entered Tuesday's game leading Sosa by three. The Cubs'
right fielder had not hit a home run since he reached 58 Saturday
night in Pittsburgh. In the Cardinal clubhouse before Tuesday's
game, Delino DeShields, their second baseman, walked over to the
mirror where the lineup card was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the Hall of Fame card?'' he asked no one in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The card had been made out by Rene Lachemann, the team's
third-base coach, in the absence of Manager Tony La Russa, who was
on his way back from his mother's funeral. La Russa was in the
dugout by the time the two rivals batted in the first inning.
Facing Kent Mercker after Mark Grace singled home a run, Sosa
rapped a single past third base, leading to a second Cubs run.
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's turn at bat in the Cardinals' half of the inning,
Steve Trachsel threw the first three pitches out of the strike
zone, much to the noisy consternation of the fans in a sold-out
Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With camera flashes exploding all over the park, McGwire, given
a green light instead of the take sign usually signaled on a 3-0
count, swung at the pitch and hit a grounder to shortstop Jose
Hernandez, who threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa batted again in the third inning and again hit a grounder
toward third. But this time, Fernando Tatis scooped up the ball and
started an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Sosa and McGwire met separately with two
officials from the Hall of Fame, Donald Marr Jr., the president,
and Jeff Idelson, the executive director of communications and
education. Marr and Idelson explained to the players what sort of
items they would be interested in obtaining for the Hall's display
on the greatest home run race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Marr and Idelson brought with them the bat with which Maris hit
his 61st home run against Tracy Stallard on Oct. 1, 1961, the last
day of that season. Both players, Idelson said, took the bat and
swung it. ``We wanted to share it with them,'' Marr said.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire swung it, Idelson related, he went one step more,
rubbing it on his chest and putting into words the sentiment he
expressed Monday after he tied Maris.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his 61st homer on Monday, McGwire pointed to the
Maris children, who were sitting in the stands near the St. Louis
dugout, pointed skyward and tapped his heart, letting them know
that their father, who died in 1985 at the age of 51, was in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, did not act as demonstratively with the bat
as McGwire did, but he was surprised to learn that Maris' bat was
the same weight, 32 ounces, and the same length, 34{ inches, as
his. McGwire uses the same weight bat, but his is half an inch
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the conversations with the players, Marr and Idelson
were confident they would have a solid representation for the Hall
in Cooperstown, N.Y. ``Mark said what he has been saying publicly
all along,'' Idelson said after a seven-minute meeting with
McGwire. ``He would be generous. He is certainly cognizant of his
role in history, and he'd like to see his achievements documented
where they should be, at the Hall of Fame. We're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did not give the Hall officials any items at the
meeting. He said earlier in the week that he uses the same bat
until he breaks it, and the one he took into Tuesday night's game
had been responsible for his last six home runs, Nos. 56 through
61.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, on the other hand, turned over the bat he used in hitting
his 57th home run, the one that broke Hack Wilson's club record.
Sosa previously gave the Hall the bat he used to break the record
for the most home runs hit in the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, was like McGwire in being aware of the
significance of his role in the chase for the home run record and
wanted it to be documented as well.
</P>
<P>
   In handling Maris' bat, Sosa was surprised, Idelson said, that
it was in such good condition for a 37-year-old bat. The Hall
received the bat and the ball Maris hit for No. 61 from Maris in
1973. The Hall also has the bat and ball from Ruth's 60th home run
in 1927. Ruth's bat was much bigger than the others, 40 ounces and
35\ inches.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa reached this juncture after a spirited contest
to see who could get to the record first. McGwire held the lead
except for two and two-third innings in a game between the
Cardinals and the Cubs on Aug. 19. Sosa hit his 48th in the fifth
inning of that game, but McGwire matched him in the eighth and went
ahead with a game-winning home run in the 10th. Sosa had not caught
up since.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was new this season to the home run stratosphere of the
50s, having hit a career high of 40 in 1996.

2 MORE PROMINENT DEMOCRATS REPRIMAND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to modify the quoted matter in 2nd graf)  (Eds: See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two more Senate Democrats Tuesday delivered
stinging rebukes of President Clinton, condemning what they said
was his ``dishonesty'' and ``immoral'' behavior. The chorus of
critics within the president's own party has gained volume as
lawmakers return to Washington anticipating a report from the
independent counsel investigating Clinton any day now.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who is related to Clinton by
marriage and who is locked in a tough Senate race, took to the
Senate floor Tuesday morning and chastised the president for
failing to take responsibility ``much earlier,'' calling his
behavior wrong, indefensible and immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's daughter married Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother in the
White House in 1994. But Boxer's press spokesman, David Sandretti,
said Tuesday that the senator, who made a point of defending
Clinton's leadership on policy issues, had no conversation with
anyone in the White House or any Clinton relative before making her
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, another Democrat who also faces a tough
re-election bid, Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings of South Carolina,
took aim at Clinton Tuesday in his home state, saying: ``We're fed
up. The behavior, the dishonesty of the president is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers delivered their remarks one day before the
House returns to session to face the daunting task of reviewing a
report by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. The report on possibly
impeachable offenses could arrive in the House as early as this
week, House Republican and Democratic aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders are preparing to hold a series of meetings on
Wednesday on how to grapple with the inquiry, including one between
Democrats and the president.
</P>
<P>
   And in an apparent change of heart, a number of key Democrats
said Tuesday that Starr's report should immediately be made public
in its entirety, a position that breaks with prior calls to keep it
secret. A host of Republicans, including Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
of Texas, have also demanded that the report be made public,
arguing that the public has the right to see and know more than may
be offered in a simple ``executive summary.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for full and prompt disclosure of the report _ perhaps
with some names redacted for privacy reasons _ appears to be
gaining momentum, Republican and Democratic aides close to the
inquiry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing and legitimate school of thought that says
let's go ahead and put the whole thing out, sink or swim,'' said
one high-ranking Democratic leadership aide.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was the first to call for full
disclosure in an Aug. 27 letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich. Since
then, others, including Reps. Charles Rangel of New York and Robert
Wexler of Florida, have added their voices. Both say that sensitive
grand jury testimony and names should be redacted from the report
before its release.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and ranking member
Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., both agree that an executive
summary of the report should be released to all members of
Congress, with the full report going only to committee members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This should not be done in secret, or by suppressing
something,'' Dingell said. ``The people need to know. This is a
judgment we're making on their behalf. Taxpayers spent $40 million
on this document. They have a right to know what's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel added Tuesday, ``There is no question that the substance
of the accusations have to be made public because it's going to get
leaked anyway and everyone between now and election will be putting
their spin on it. I don't see that we have an option.''
</P>
<P>
   One House Democratic aide said some Democrats simply fear being
``blindsided'' by the White House before the November elections if
the report is not made available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler argued that making the document public could allow
Clinton to respond, if his request to review the report before it
is sent to Congress is rejected by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president needs to have an opportunity to respond to Ken
Starr's allegations and conclusions to the extent that they are
contained in the report,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing themselves for the inquiry, Republicans and Democrats
have scheduled an important series of meetings on Wednesday to
begin planning how best to handle the report, both procedurally and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who is deeply concerned about the erosion of
support among Democrats in Congress, plans to meet Wednesday
morning with the senior eight members of the House Democratic
leadership at the White House. Members are expecting an apology
from the president for deceiving them, House Democratic aides said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry described the meeting as
focusing on the congressional agenda as well as the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican leaders will huddle at a ``retreat'' in
the afternoon to sort out their strategies. And in the morning
House leaders from both parties, including Hyde and Conyers, are
expected to come together to discuss House procedures for handling
Starr's report. Democrats are opposed to a bid by Hyde to garner
what aides call ``unprecedented powers'' for his committee, such as
the ability to subpoena witnesses and cite witnesses for contempt
without a full House vote, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Hyde have both said that it is important the
process be bipartisan. And Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of
the House Rules Committee, has said he wants to grant only a few
exceptions to existing House procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday a House Republican aide described the matter as
``fluid,'' while the Democrats' chief counsel on the Judiciary
Committee described the two sides as being ``a long way off on
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the whole inquiry could be wrapped up before the
election, as some Democrats and Republicans are hoping, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said he didn't think so.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire made the most out of the least Tuesday
night, setting major league baseball's home run record by hitting
his 62nd and shortest home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging at the first pitch from Steve Trachsel of the Chicago
Cubs with two outs in the fourth inning, McGwire lined a low-flying
shot that just cleared the left-field fence near the corner where
the stands meet the foul line. The drive, hit at 8:18 Central
Daylight Time, was estimated at 341 feet, 6 feet shorter than
McGwire's previous shortest this season. He has hit five home runs
longer than 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed-hitting first baseman for
the St. Louis Cardinals, broke the tie with Roger Maris that he had
forged only the day before. In 1961, Maris hit his 61st home run in
the Yankees' 163rd and last game of the season. This was the
Cardinals' 145th game.
</P>
<P>
   The home run set off a wild scene at Busch Stadium, starting
with McGwire's dance to first base on which he missed the base and
had to be told by Dave McKay, the Cardinals' first-base coach, to
touch it. As McGwire rounded the bases, the Cubs infielders
congratulated him, and when he reached home plate, Scott Servais,
the Cubs' catcher, shook his hand and then they embraced. Minutes
later, Sammy Sosa, who has been challenging McGwire in the home run
record chase, ran in from right field and went to McGwire, who
picked him up before they embraced.
</P>
<P>
   One home run away from breaking the record, McGwire on Tuesday
picked up the bat that Maris used to hit his record-breaking homer
in 1961, rubbed the barrel of the bat across his broad chest and
said, ``Roger, you're with me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has spoken in recent days of communicating with
Maris and Babe Ruth after he dies, came together with Maris' bat
two hours before the start of the Cardinals-Cubs game. McGwire tied
Maris' record by clubbing his 61st home run on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire entered Tuesday's game leading Sosa by three. The Cubs'
right fielder had not hit a home run since he reached 58 Saturday
night in Pittsburgh. In the Cardinal clubhouse before Tuesday's
game, Delino DeShields, their second baseman, walked over to the
mirror where the lineup card was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the Hall of Fame card?'' he asked no one in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The card had been made out by Rene Lachemann, the team's
third-base coach, in the absence of Manager Tony La Russa, who was
on his way back from his mother's funeral. La Russa was in the
dugout by the time the two rivals batted in the first inning.
Facing Kent Mercker after Mark Grace singled home a run, Sosa
rapped a single past third base, leading to a second Cubs run.
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's turn at bat in the Cardinals' half of the inning,
Steve Trachsel threw the first three pitches out of the strike
zone, much to the noisy consternation of the fans in a sold-out
Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With camera flashes exploding all over the park, McGwire, given
a green light instead of the take sign usually signaled on a 3-0
count, swung at the pitch and hit a grounder to shortstop Jose
Hernandez, who threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa batted again in the third inning and again hit a grounder
toward third. But this time, Fernando Tatis scooped up the ball and
started an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Sosa and McGwire met separately with two
officials from the Hall of Fame, Donald Marr Jr., the president,
and Jeff Idelson, the executive director of communications and
education. Marr and Idelson explained to the players what sort of
items they would be interested in obtaining for the Hall's display
on the greatest home run race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Marr and Idelson brought with them the bat with which Maris hit
his 61st home run against Tracy Stallard on Oct. 1, 1961, the last
day of that season. Both players, Idelson said, took the bat and
swung it. ``We wanted to share it with them,'' Marr said.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire swung it, Idelson related, he went one step more,
rubbing it on his chest and putting into words the sentiment he
expressed Monday after he tied Maris.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his 61st homer on Monday, McGwire pointed to the
Maris children, who were sitting in the stands near the St. Louis
dugout, pointed skyward and tapped his heart, letting them know
that their father, who died in 1985 at the age of 51, was in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, did not act as demonstratively with the bat
as McGwire did, but he was surprised to learn that Maris' bat was
the same weight, 32 ounces, and the same length, 34{ inches, as
his. McGwire uses the same weight bat, but his is half an inch
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the conversations with the players, Marr and Idelson
were confident they would have a solid representation for the Hall
in Cooperstown, N.Y. ``Mark said what he has been saying publicly
all along,'' Idelson said after a seven-minute meeting with
McGwire. ``He would be generous. He is certainly cognizant of his
role in history, and he'd like to see his achievements documented
where they should be, at the Hall of Fame. We're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did not give the Hall officials any items at the
meeting. He said earlier in the week that he uses the same bat
until he breaks it, and the one he took into Tuesday night's game
had been responsible for his last six home runs, Nos. 56 through
61.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, on the other hand, turned over the bat he used in hitting
his 57th home run, the one that broke Hack Wilson's club record.
Sosa previously gave the Hall the bat he used to break the record
for the most home runs hit in the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, Idelson said, was like McGwire in being aware of the
significance of his role in the chase for the home run record and
wanted it to be documented as well.
</P>
<P>
   In handling Maris' bat, Sosa was surprised, Idelson said, that
it was in such good condition for a 37-year-old bat. The Hall
received the bat and the ball Maris hit for No. 61 from Maris in
1973. The Hall also has the bat and ball from Ruth's 60th home run
in 1927. Ruth's bat was much bigger than the others, 40 ounces and
35\ inches.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa reached this juncture after a spirited contest
to see who could get to the record first. McGwire held the lead
except for two and two-third innings in a game between the
Cardinals and the Cubs on Aug. 19. Sosa hit his 48th in the fifth
inning of that game, but McGwire matched him in the eighth and went
ahead with a game-winning home run in the 10th. Sosa had not caught
up since.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was new this season to the home run stratosphere of the
50s, having hit a career high of 40 in 1996.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time he began playing baseball as an 8-year-old in
Claremont, Calif., Mark McGwire has been a reluctant home run
hitter and a reluctant hero. McGwire wanted to be a pitcher, not a
hitter, and he remained on the mound until college. He has always
wanted to avoid being the primary focus in a team sport.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how reluctant McGwire is to be the slugger in the
spotlight, his thunderous swings produce the sort of prodigious
home runs that have turned him into a larger-than-life figure.
Every fan loves watching baseballs rocket out of stadiums, so every
fan has reveled in McGwire's prowess as he has slipped into his
crouch, uncoiled and crushed another pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Especially this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's captivating run to history culminated Tuesday night
when he belted his 62nd homer to eclipse Roger Maris' hallowed
37-year-old record for the most in one season. McGwire, whose
reluctance abated as he glided toward this moment, broke the record
in the St. Louis Cardinals' 145th game. He instantly became the
most successful home run hitter for one season and a modern
baseball hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed of being in this position,'' the 34-year-old
McGwire said last month. ``I dreamed about being a big leaguer.
Things happen for a reason. Hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the people who watched McGwire develop from a robust
teen-ager who played golf and soccer before baseball, and they
inevitably discuss his work habits. Although his tantalizing story
sometimes seems predestined _ he homered in his first at bat for
the Claremont Little League Athletics _ McGwire did not wake up as
a 17-year-old with a 90-mile-an-hour fastball and a mighty
uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carroll, who coached McGwire at Damien High School in La
Verne, Calif., has a vision of him that swims in his mind. It is
McGwire on the field or in the dugout with his red hair drenched,
his face sweating. That is how McGwire always looked to Carroll:
working or poised to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was not afraid to work,'' Carroll said. ``God gave him
talent, but he worked hard, and that set him apart. God gives
everyone talents. Mark did something with his.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark David McGwire, born Oct. 1, 1963, was the second oldest in
a sports-oriented family of five boys whose cul-de-sac was a field
for all seasons. When he was 5, he caddied for his father, John,
and became intrigued by golf. But John McGwire, a dentist, and his
wife, Ginger, did not allow Mark and Dan, the younger brother who
went on to play quarterback for the Seahawks and the Dolphins, to
become egocentric about sports.
</P>
<P>
   John McGwire never told Mark about the coaches who predicted a
major league career for him, and Ginger believed that Mark never
became adversely affected by success because he was schooled to
respect others. He disliked receiving extra attention, and even
last month McGwire said: ``I don't know anyone who plays this game
to get the attention. I know I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Dedeaux, McGwire's baseball coach at the University of
Southern California, recalled how the burly young man was a
``natural leader'' through his quiet, blue-collar approach. When
McGwire first arrived at Southern Cal, he filled out a form for the
media guide and left the section about athletic accomplishments
blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very unselfish, very disciplined and was a great
teammate, and that comes from having wonderful parents,'' Dedeaux
said. ``You learn all of that from your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire learned even more. His career has been hampered by foot
and back injuries, and he pondered retirement after a 1991 season
in which he batted .201. But then McGwire thought about his
father's lifelong fight. John McGwire learned as a 7-year-old that
he had polio, and he walks with a cane because one of his legs is
much shorter than the other. Now, at 61, he is an avid golfer and
cyclist, once biking 400 miles from San Francisco to Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   How could he quit, Mark reasoned, if his father never did?
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone, McGwire has had his share of problems. He
underwent therapy for four years because, he said, he was an
emotional wreck after his baseball struggles in 1991. He faltered
as a husband, was divorced after four years of marriage and has
said he wishes he could do it all over. He is immersed in
controversy for using androstenedione, a testosterone-inducing
supplement that is legal in baseball but banned in professional
football and the Olympics. He was once asked if he is near-sighted
or far-sighted and he responded, ``blind.'' Without contact lenses,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire is a devoted father to Matthew, his 10-year old son
whose pictures line his locker and who has been a bat boy during
the home run chase. He gives $1 million a year from his three-year,
$28.5 million contract with St. Louis to charities for physically
and sexually abused children. And he is one of the most popular
players of his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people love him so much that he can't go anywhere or do
anything,'' said Pat Kelly, a teammate. ``Everybody wants a piece
of him. At dinner, at a movie. The guy gets mobbed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos drafted McGwire in the eighth round out of
Damien High in 1981 but offered him a signing bonus of only $8,500.
So he accepted a baseball scholarship to Southern Cal with an eye
toward becoming a major league pitcher. By his sophomore year,
McGwire wanted to play first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see the balls jumping off the bat every day in
batting practice,'' Dedeaux said. ``You didn't have to see a game
to realize he had to play a real position. When you saw him hit the
ball nine miles, that was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Southern Cal, McGwire met Kathy, one of the bat girls,
and they married in 1984. The Oakland Athletics drafted McGwire in
the first round that year, signing him for $125,000, and he
catapulted to stardom in 1987 by bashing a rookie record of 49
homers. McGwire had the chance for a 50th on the final day of the
season, but he left the A's in Chicago to return to California to
be with his wife as she gave birth to Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a tough decision to make,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the A's trampled opponents while winning 104 games and
were favored to win the World Series, but they lost to Kirk Gibson
and the Dodgers. It was also a difficult personal year for McGwire,
who went through a divorce. He and his ex-wife share custody of
Matthew, who lives in California with his mother and stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire played in two more World Series with the A's, winning
one from San Francisco in the earthquake-interrupted series of 1989
and losing to the Reds in 1990. After a dreary 1991, McGwire
rebounded with 42 homers in 1992 and then missed virtually all of
1993 and 1994 because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 39 homers in 1995, erupted for 52 in 1996 and had 34
by July 31 in 1997, but the rebuilding A's traded him to St. Louis
instead of trying to re-sign him. He left having hit 363 homers for
the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have underachieved this season, but McGwire's
pursuit of Maris helped rekindle interest in the sport and helped
recapture a legion of fans. Reluctant hero or not, McGwire's
fantasy season will be remembered as one of the best and the most
exciting in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like apple pie,'' McGwire said. ``Every child, boy or
girl, has picked up a ball, a bat or a glove. Everybody can relate
to this sport. That's why I think all Americans can relate to this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And, now, to Mark McGwire and his new home run record.

   ST. LOUIS _ Just keep belting the ball out of the park, early
and often. This was the way to exorcise all the ghosts and the
shadows, the doubts and the quibbles, the parenthetical clauses and
the modifying phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has politely kept Babe Ruth and Roger Maris on
their pedestals, but he caught them quickly, before anybody could
drag out charts and theories to diminish what the big boy has done.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night against the Cubs, McGwire, in his second at-bat,
hit his 62nd homer in his team's 145th game _ giving him more
homers in a season than anybody who ever played major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say they put an asterisk on it,'' McGwire said
after launching No. 61 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before McGwire crushed another. And
in a way, that took away from the drama. There has been no autumnal
chill, no pennant-race jitters, no sense of urgency, not like the
haunted Maris trudging around the bases with his head half down in
the Oct. 1 shadows of Yankee Stadium, doing it on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   After stultifying heat and humidity on the Labor Day weekend,
there was finally a brisk September feel to Busch Stadium Tuesday
night, but until now McGwire and his buddy Sammy Sosa have been
playing in an endless summer. Impervious to major slump or serious
injury or pressure, McGwire made it easier for himself by roaring
past 50, hitting 60 and setting his sights on 70. That's the way to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Roger Maris hit 61 homers in 162 Yankee games in
1961, and Babe Ruth hit 60 homers in 154 Yankee games in 1927, when
the schedule went to only 154 games. Sosa, the laughing cavalier,
went into last night's game with 58 homers in the Cubs' first 144
games.
</P>
<P>
   These were remarkable performances by both McGwire and Sosa,
that cannot be even partly diminished by citing friendly ball
parks, expansion pitching, helpful supplements, weight machines and
jet-age balls.
</P>
<P>
   These two men, along with Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle, who went
into Tuesday with 50 home runs, are the next generation of
world-level athlete: McGwire, bulked up at 34 but more agile than
he was in his 20s; Sosa, powerful and compact; and Griffey, lithe
and airborne, pulling home runs back over the fences on defense,
laughing his way past the weight room and the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flicker of an asterisk a few weeks back when an
astute reporter noticed, in plain sight, a container of
androstenedione in McGwire's locker. The slugger admitted he was
using the over-the-counter substance to help build his body, but
baseball had no rule against the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   In taking androstenedione, McGwire has done nothing illegal _
dangerous, maybe, but not illegal. With his eye, with his hands,
with his acquired hitter's reflexes, he has deflected even a
potential symbolic asterisk, unlike poor Maris in 1961, the first
year of the 162-game schedule. Commissioner Ford C. Frick, formerly
Babe Ruth's ghost writer, tagged a mostly unseen asterisk on Maris,
who had 59 homers through the first 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great admirer of Ford Frick,'' said the new
commissioner, Bud Selig, ``but that was not one of his greatest
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has cited the sentiments for Ruth and Mickey Mantle
during Maris' bittersweet year: ``You have two strikes against you
in the huge city of New York. I mean, that is not good. There
again, there are people being negative out there that just didn't
want to see somebody do history. The fact is, he did it. The fact
is that everybody should be happy for Roger Maris and his family.
Records are meant to be broken. It just happens that we are close
to it right now, and it is going to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McGwire said of Maris: ``It was not fair to criticize
him. Is it his fault that he played when they changed it to 162
games?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris Jr. has watched the home run derby of 1998 with a
twinge of sadness. ``Everybody knows who Mark McGwire is,'' he
said. ``Everyone is pulling for Mark McGwire and they want to see
him do this and I think that would be just an outstanding feeling
for my father. And, yeah, I wished that would have happened for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Roger Maris felt saddled with an asterisk, for all
time. By crushing so many home runs, so early, McGwire and Sosa are
knocking the asterisk out of the ball park.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Wendy Levy Jackson is a successful real estate broker,
but you can't blame her for tuning in every night for the latest on
Mark McGwire's quest to surpass Roger Maris as baseball's
single-season home run king.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she has about 3,000 McGwire baseball cards, part of
an unusual inheritance from her late husband, Stanley Jackson. And
she has another 500 or so of McGwire posing with Jose Canseco when
they were with the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he'd hit another one, my friends would call and
congratulate me,'' said Jackson, who is 51. ``We were all rooting
for him. One of my friends said, `You would think he's my relative
or something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how Stanley Jackson, who died in March 1997, would have
reveled in McGwire's home run success this season, Wendy went to
the Mount Nebo-Levitt Weinstein Cemetery in South Miami-Dade, where
her late husband is buried, after McGwire had hit four out of Pro
Player Stadium last week in two games against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   She was there about four minutes when she heard someone softly
call her name. It was Howard Rosen, her husband's longtime friend,
who had gone to the cemetery for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both appreciated how much he would have just loved this,''
Jackson said Tuesday, looking around her South Miami-Dade townhouse
at the impact McGwire had on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Jackson had adopted McGwire as one of his favorite
players in a three-year frenzy of baseball-card collecting that
began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a veterinarian by day and he did baseball cards by
night and weekends,'' she said. ``I watched him do it for a while,
then I figured I might as well get involved, and I'd go with him to
some of the card shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her husband, she became known in local baseball card
show circles as ``Ms. Mint,'' for having an abundance of mint
condition cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her most valuable cards now are squirreled away in safe-deposit
boxes, and her lesser ones fill a storeroom. She has cards of
McGwire in a variety of hitting poses, as well as him on defense.
She initially thought she had just 2,487 of McGwire, until she
found a 500-card album of him during various stages of his career
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   His most valuable card, according to Rheal McMullen, owner of
Sports Cards USA in Sunrise, Fla., is No. 401 _ a 1985 Topps of
McGwire with the United States Olympic team before his first season
with the Oakland A's. This is McGwire's official rookie card.
</P>
<P>
   A rare mint condition card of that variety can bring $1,400,
according to McMullen. Lesser quality Topps '85's can bring between
$200 and $300, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she has 148 of those cards, most of which are in
excellent condition. Ron Tannenbaum, who puts on baseball card
shows in South Florida, said the new rates are coming out later
this week, and he expects McGwire's cards to be ``about 50 percent
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything with McGwire is going up,'' McMullen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Waldo Rodriguez, who owns the Sports Card Center in the Little
Havana section of Miami, said most of his customers seek out
McGwire memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as cards, the rookie card is what everybody is looking
for,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she never asked her husband why he liked McGwire so
much, but he did leave a clue as to why he accumulated nearly
100,000 sports cards, 90 percent of them in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Florida journalism alumnus, he wrote this in an
alumni publication:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mick is middle-aged, The Duke of Flatbush has gray hair,
Stan The Man from St. Louis owns restaurants . . . and Billy Martin
is dead. How come, then, I still collect baseball cards? Because my
young son rekindled a former passion. Because I grew up with
baseball and I'll die with baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was not the only player who was popular with Stanley
Jackson. He has about 3,000 of Wally Joyner's cards, because of his
son David's fondness for the current San Diego first baseman. He
also has ``untold boxes'' of Reggie Jackson, the former Oakland and
Yankees slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson now would like to sell the whole collection at one time,
and has set up a separate phone number _ 305-981-7672 _ to do so.
She estimates that her husband invested between $50,000 and $60,000
in the cards, plus a big chunk of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I do, I am going to be careful about it,'' she said.
``Stanley put his heart and soul into this.''

SOSA SHOWS RESPECT; MCGWIRE RETURNS IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``a'' news file.) 
(th) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sammy Sosa kept saying that he wanted Mark McGwire
to break Roger Maris' home run record and kept insisting that
McGwire would do it. Over and over, Sosa stayed consistent and
often seemed like McGwire's biggest fan instead of his biggest
competitor. He remained true to his words with his actions Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire drilled a bullet that hugged the left field line
and barely cleared the left field fence in the fourth inning, Sosa
smiled from right field. He watched a delirious McGwire stumble
around the bases, watched him celebrate his 62nd homer in animated
fashion and could not resist congratulating him. Sosa hustled in
from right field and actually joined the party.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing scene involving McGwire and Sosa, a scene for
baseball history and a scene that crossed barriers and spoke of
brotherhood. McGwire embraced Sosa and lifted him, like he was a
package of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Then McGwire and Sosa touched their fists high and then stopped
just short of punching each other in the stomach, which has become
McGwire's trademark following homers during this memorable season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sosa returned to right, McGwire also paid tribute to him
by performing his routine following homers. McGwire touched his
lips and kissed them twice and pointed to the skies. McGwire then
hugged Sosa one more time and later thanked him when he spoke
briefly with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa,'' McGwire said, gazing out toward right at Busch
Stadium, ``you're unbelievable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Sosa could not even pull on his uniform pants
without having a media relations official shadowing him and waving
off a group of reporters who tried to speak with the happiest of
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not right now, thank you,'' Sosa said politely as reporters
descended upon him. ``We'll do this later, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Cubs, a team that is trying to reach the
post-season for the first time since 1989, were alone and
available. Rod Beck sipped a drink and read a newspaper in front of
his locker. Mark Grace smoked a cigarette and jokingly wondered if
McGwire would take a rest after blasting his 61st homer on Monday.
Mickey Morandini fiddled with a fresh bat and stared at the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   If a person from another country with no sports knowledge had
stumbled into the clubhouse, it would have taken about 10 seconds
to realize that Sosa is the most wanted Cub. No one else had a
bodyguard. No one else had 20 reporters waiting for him to utter a
few syllables.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that has been a silent blessing for the Cubs because they
have not been overly burdened with fielding questions about the
organization's ignominious history of not winning a World Series
title since 1908 and not even appearing in one since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said Grace, ``Sammy is the main story on this
team. There's only one guy whose ever had a better season than him,
and that's McGwire. As long as he handles it well, we all feed off
it and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Cubs conceded that the attention given to Sosa's pursuit
of McGwire and of their pursuit of Roger Maris has sometimes
overshadowed the type of season that the loyalists at Wrigley Field
have long prayed for.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the players emphasized that their focus has remained
on winning the wild card, they admitted it has not been the central
theme for fans and most of the news media. The Cubs and Mets
entered Tuesday night tied at 80-64 for the National League wild
card (the Mets lost their game 16-4), but that race is secondary to
most of the world fascinated with homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's the home run thing,'' said Morandini.
``They're eating it up. It's consuming everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said: ``We're focused on the chase. It's our only focus.
It might not be the fan's focus. In baseball, there's the Yankees,
McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood and the playoff chase. We're
part of it. Sammy, Kerry and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa has handled the tenuous situation with aplomb by
constantly repeating that the post-season is his ``main concern,''
at least one Cub expressed disgust with the ongoing publicity about
the long balls.
</P>
<P>
   When two reporters approached Bck and requested an interview,
he asked them what it would entail. When he was told the wild card
would be the subject, he agreed to talk. But once Beck was asked if
the carnival surrounding Sosa had allowed the Cubs to play in more
anonymity, he responded, ``A little bit,'' and then turned ornery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk about winning baseball games,'' said Beck.
``I'm sick and tired of this home run stuff. It does take second
fiddle. It's what the media wants to talk about. The only thing we
want to talk about is the wild card and winning baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-season is Sosa's priority, too, and the focus might
shift to that now that McGwire has eclipsed the record. Sosa, who
began the night with 58 homers, always said he hoped that McGwire
would get the record and that the Cubs would get the chance to play
games in October. So far, half his wishes have come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire,'' Sosa has said, ``is the man.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Baseball resurrected with McGwire
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Baseball officially rose all the way from the dead
Tuesday night inside the loudest of tombs called Busch Stadium.
There, Roger Maris joined Babe Ruth as just another guy behind Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   This wonderful crusade to a 62nd home run ended with a screamer
just over the fence in left field in the fourth inning. It was
McGwire's shortest homer of the year at 341 feet, but it was the
biggest. Such was true, not only for McGwire, but for a suffering
game that needed every bit of what eventually turned this ballpark
into the loveliest madhouse you'll ever see after McGwire's shot
curled about five feet away from the foul pole into history.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, everything on this side of the universe was so loud,
so glorious, so unbelievable that McGwire nearly forgot to touch
first base on his home run trot. What followed was exactly 10
minutes of McGwire hugging the world. It started with his
10-year-old son Matthew, and it ended with the rest of us, still
rubbing our eyes after watching McGwire spend the last four days
conquering Ruth, Maris and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   This is among the greatest feel-good stories of our time. No, of
any time, and you can tell as much by the way much of the universe
ceased to function recently until McGwire left a batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can breathe again, and then we can search for ways to
keep our hearts from pounding so much.
</P>
<P>
   Among those with chills the size of an average McGwire blast was
an Atlanta columnist who has felt this way only twice before in
baseball. I was in Cincinnati that September night in 1985 when
Pete Rose turned his hometown into Disney World along the Ohio by
passing Ty Cobb for most career hits. Then, 10 Septembers later, I
saw Cal Ripken Jr. take his electric victory lap around Baltimore's
Camden Yards under a full moon after he surpassed Lou Gehrig's
streak of consecutive games played.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. This was the best of them all. The feats of Rose and
Ripken were amazing, but they primarily involved longevity. In
contrast, there was no sense of inevitability that McGwire would
slam enough homers before the end of this season to catch Ruth or
Maris. Plus, McGwire had his two legends to battle, while Rose and
Ripken had their one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest reason why McGwire's ongoing moments surpass
those of Rose and Ripken is that McGwire's moments slam an
exclamation point on baseball's recovery from the brutal strike of
1994 and 1995. We're not referring as much here to McGwire's march
to Nos. 60, 61 and 62 as we are to the class with which he has
achieved them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, McGwire has signed eternal autographs and
answered eternal questions. He's been a loving father by squeezing
his son with his arms or his words whenever possible. He's kicked
Charles Barkley in the teeth by saying that he is a role model.
He's even shown as much by donating $1 million each year to battle
child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Said John McGwire, Mark's father, whose 61st birthday present on
Monday was Mark's 61st homer: ``He's a man of faith. He's a father
who loves his son. He's a good citizen. He loves this country like
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, McGwire likes to acknowledge that he has been
blessed with an impressive supporting cast, starting with Chicago
Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, McGwire's closest pursuer with 58 homers
and biggest cheerleader. When they aren't pushing each other on the
field (they've homered 20 times on the same day), they're
suggesting the other is the greatest thing to happen to the game
since the invention of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   During those 10 minutes of absolute bedlam after No. 62, Sosa
raced in from right field to smash fists with McGwire and exchange
punches to the gut. Then McGwire grabbed Sosa in the biggest of
hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Good for them. Good for baseball. Good for the universe, because
we definitely need it.

<P>
   Tuesday night against the Cubs, McGwire, in his second at-bat,
hit his 62nd homer in his team's 145th game _ giving him more
homers in a season than anybody who ever played major league
baseball.
</P>

the schedule went to only 154 games. Sosa, the laughing cavalier,
went into last night's game with 58 homers in the Cubs' first 144
games.
</P>
<P>
   These were remarkable performances by both McGwire and Sosa,
that cannot be even partly diminished by citing friendly ball

dangerous, maybe, but not illegal. With his eye, with his hands,
with his acquired hitter's reflexes, he has deflected even a
potential symbolic asterisk, unlike poor Maris in 1961, the first
year of the 162-game schedule. Commissioner Ford C. Frick, formerly
Babe Ruth's ghost writer, tagged a mostly unseen asterisk on Maris,
who had 59 homers through the first 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great admirer of Ford Frick,'' said the new
commissioner, Bud Selig, ``but that was not one of his greatest
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has cited the sentiments for Ruth and Mickey Mantle
during Maris' bittersweet year: ``You have two strikes against you
in the huge city of New York. I mean, that is not good. There
again, there are people being negative out there that just didn't
want to see somebody do history. The fact is, he did it. The fact
is that everybody should be happy for Roger Maris and his family.
Records are meant to be broken. It just happens that we are close
to it right now, and it is going to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McGwire said of Maris: ``It was not fair to criticize
him. Is it his fault that he played when they changed it to 162
games?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris Jr. has watched the home run derby of 1998 with a
twinge of sadness. ``Everybody knows who Mark McGwire is,'' he
said. ``Everyone is pulling for Mark McGwire and they want to see
him do this and I think that would be just an outstanding feeling
for my father. And, yeah, I wished that would have happened for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Roger Maris felt saddled with an asterisk, for all
time. By crushing so many home runs, so early, McGwire and Sosa are
knocking the asterisk out of the ball park.

 AGASSI'S RALLY COMES UP SHORT AGAINSt KUCERA

   NEW YORK _ They were shunted from one stadium to another,
assigned a match schedule that shifted from day to night and back
into day. They were ordered to start their Round of 16 tilt on a
dark, damp court Monday night and finish it Tuesday on a dry court
that sparkled like an emerald.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Andre Agassi and Karol Kucera for being so confused
about their U.S. Open mission that they occasionally forgot how to
play tennis and lapsed into a five-set comedy of unforced errors,
145 in all, that eventually cost this Grand Slam the continued
services of its 1994 champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you deal with the elements, and curveballs, two
players have to deal with it, and I think he dealt with it better
than I did,'' said the eighth-seeded Agassi after Kucera avenged
his loss at the 1996 Olympics with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-3
victory Tuesday. He will face top-seeded Pete Sampras. Not only did
Agassi hate being bumped from Arthur Ashe Stadium by Monday's
storm, but he also hated being upstaged by a fellow who returned
better than he did when their cliffhanger resolved itself Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I lost it,'' Agassi said. ``He definitely
stepped it up, and I didn't respond there in the middle of the
fifth when I could have continued to make it tough on him.'' Agassi
did not reach the quarterfinals in any of the four Grand Slams he
played in this year and, despite being two break points from a 3-0
lead in the final set Tuesday, saw his record in comebacks from two
sets down lapse to 2-5. ``That's when it slipped away,'' he said of
that third game. ``The big picture is, yeah, I lost in the Round of
16 at the U.S. Open.'' Agassi, 28, did the same thing last year by
becoming the fourth in Patrick Rafter's string of seven victims.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open's defending champion, Rafter handled the two-day
format better than Agassi did. Like Agassi's match, Rafter's
fourth-round duel with 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, the Croat ace
machine, was delayed by Monday's monsoon. But unlike Agassi, Rafter
coped with the weather interruptions, liked his assignment at
Arthur Ashe Stadium and outhustled Ivanisevic for a 6-3, 6-4, 4-6,
6-1 victory that carried him into the quarterfinals against Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to concern myself about the different situations
at all; I didn't have a preference either way,'' said Rafter, who
has a 2-4 record against his next opponent, a semifinalist here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, top-seeded Martina Hingis defeated sixth-seeded
Monica Seles, 6-4, 6-4, to reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides losing Agassi and 13th-seeded Tim Henman, who was
overpowered by Mark Philippoussis, 7-5, 0-6, 6-4, 6-1, the Open
also absorbed the premature departure of another disgruntled seeded
player, Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. The French Open's 1996
champion and seventh-seeded player here was upset, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3,
7-6 (8-6), by 33d-ranked Thomas Johansson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was too much pressure on me,'' Kafelnikov said. ``The
draw was quite open on my side, and I just haven't had a situation
like that in a long time and didn't know how to handle it.''
Kafelnikov's situation was quite different from Agassi's and
Kucera's. At least Kafelnikov knew when and where his fourth-round
match would be played. All Agassi and Kucera knew was that they
would be facing each other.
</P>
<P>
   Was this any way for the U.S. Open to treat the two players
vying for a high-profile quarterfinal with top-seeded Sampras, the
four-time champion who is trying for a record 12th Grand Slam
title?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the most interesting match in my career,''
Kucera said. After he saw a couple of his nine lives evaporate
Monday night once Agassi started making a comeback, it was his
mentor, Miloslav Mecir, who cautioned him to stick to tennis and to
leave the show business _ including moonballs, tantrums and
imitations _ to his desperate opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough for me to stay concentrated on my tactics,''
said Kucera, who endured a wild crowd Monday and again Tuesday
after Agassi won the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   When the rain drove Agassi and his bag of tricks off the Louis
Armstrong Stadium court Monday night, he had just figured out how
to stop playing like a worm on a hook and had wriggled his way out
of a two-sets-to-none predicament against Slovakia's ninth-seeded
Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's desperate attempts for a victory included moonballs,
fastballs and a devastating imitation of Kucera's hemming and
hawing over his ball toss as he prepared for every serve. The high
jinks began midway through the third set, with Agassi down a break
and three games from an exit. His moonballs assisted in a break
against Kucera that got him to 3-4, and his service-line theatrics
helped him hold for 4-4 and helped to further distract Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said all's fair at that crisis point in a Grand Slam.
``Last night it got to the point where it was so competitive, we
could have put on boxing gloves,'' Agassi said. ``Today was all
about tennis. Last night he wasn't ready to hurt me. Today he was,
and he did.''  &QL;

SOSA SHOWS RESPECT; MCGWIRE RETURNS IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``a'' news file.)

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sammy Sosa kept saying that he wanted Mark McGwire
to break Roger Maris' home run record and kept insisting that
McGwire would do it. Over and over, Sosa stayed consistent and
often seemed like McGwire's biggest fan instead of his biggest
competitor. He remained true to his words with his actions Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire drilled a bullet that hugged the left field line
and barely cleared the left field fence in the fourth inning, Sosa
smiled from right field. He watched a delirious McGwire stumble
around the bases, watched him celebrate his 62nd homer in animated
fashion and could not resist congratulating him. Sosa hustled in
from right field and actually joined the party.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing scene involving McGwire and Sosa, a scene for
baseball history and a scene that crossed barriers and spoke of
brotherhood. McGwire embraced Sosa and lifted him, like he was a
package of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Then McGwire and Sosa touched their fists high and then stopped
just short of punching each other in the stomach, which has become
McGwire's trademark following homers during this memorable season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sosa returned to right, McGwire also paid tribute to him
by performing his routine following homers. McGwire touched his
lips and kissed them twice and pointed to the skies. McGwire then
hugged Sosa one more time and later thanked him when he spoke
briefly with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa,'' McGwire said, gazing out toward right at Busch
Stadium, ``you're unbelievable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Sosa could not even pull on his uniform pants
without having a media relations official shadowing him and waving
off a group of reporters who tried to speak with the happiest of
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not right now, thank you,'' Sosa said politely as reporters
descended upon him. ``We'll do this later, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Cubs, a team that is trying to reach the
post-season for the first time since 1989, were alone and
available. Rod Beck sipped a drink and read a newspaper in front of
his locker. Mark Grace smoked a cigarette and jokingly wondered if
McGwire would take a rest after blasting his 61st homer on Monday.
Mickey Morandini fiddled with a fresh bat and stared at the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   If a person from another country with no sports knowledge had
stumbled into the clubhouse, it would have taken about 10 seconds
to realize that Sosa is the most wanted Cub. No one else had a
bodyguard. No one else had 20 reporters waiting for him to utter a
few syllables.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that has been a silent blessing for the Cubs because they
have not been overly burdened with fielding questions about the
organization's ignominious history of not winning a World Series
title since 1908 and not even appearing in one since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said Grace, ``Sammy is the main story on this
team. There's only one guy whose ever had a better season than him,
and that's McGwire. As long as he handles it well, we all feed off
it and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Cubs conceded that the attention given to Sosa's pursuit
of McGwire and of their pursuit of Roger Maris has sometimes
overshadowed the type of season that the loyalists at Wrigley Field
have long prayed for.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the players emphasized that their focus has remained
on winning the wild card, they admitted it has not been the central
theme for fans and most of the news media. The Cubs and Mets
entered Tuesday night tied at 80-64 for the National League wild
card (the Mets lost their game with the Philadelphia Phillies
16-4), but that race is secondary to most of the world fascinated
with homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's the home run thing,'' said Morandini.
``They're eating it up. It's consuming everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said: ``We're focused on the chase. It's our only focus.
It might not be the fan's focus. In baseball, there's the Yankees,
McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood and the playoff chase. We're
part of it. Sammy, Kerry and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa has handled the tenuous situation with aplomb by
constantly repeating that the post-season is his ``main concern,''
at least one Cub expressed disgust with the ongoing publicity about
the long balls.
</P>
<P>
   When two reporters approached Beck and requested an interview,
he asked them what it would entail. When he was told the wild card
would be the subject, he agreed to talk. But once Beck was asked if
the carnival surrounding Sosa had allowed the Cubs to play in more
anonymity, he responded, ``A little bit,'' and then turned ornery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk about winning baseball games,'' said Beck.
``I'm sick and tired of this home run stuff. It does take second
fiddle. It's what the media wants to talk about. The only thing we
want to talk about is the wild card and winning baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-season is Sosa's priority, too, and the focus might
shift to that now that McGwire has eclipsed the record. Sosa, who
began the night with 58 homers, always said he hoped that McGwire
would get the record and that the Cubs would get the chance to play
games in October. So far, half his wishes have come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire,'' Sosa has said, ``is the man.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Baseball, America ushers in new hero
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For a few seconds Tuesday night the baseball world
stopped and stared. From their television sets, from their seats at
Busch Stadium, through the eyes of radio announcers, they peered
down a third-base line, adrenaline flowing, stomach aching, and
prayed that a baseball hit by Mark McGwire had enough to get it
over a 10-foot wall.
</P>
<P>
   The moment seemed to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ball disappeared; McGwire's arms went toward the
heavens, and the fans in attendance began screaming, stomping,
crying and relishing their moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   The chase has ended. McGwire's 62nd homer, off Cubs pitcher
Steve Traschel, broke the single-season record for home runs set by
Roger Maris in 1961. The line drive down the left-field line,
measured at 341 feet, barely cleared the fence.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's shortest home run of the season, but it was
good enough to go into the history books.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire reached down to golf the ball and had trouble following
its path. He was halfway down the first-base line when he realized
the ball cleared the fence. He became so wrapped up in the moment
that he missed first base while being congratulated by coach Dave
McKay, who steered McGwire back to touch the base.
</P>
<P>
   He then continued around the bases, slapping every player. When
he finally got around third base, with flashbulbs going off
everywhere, he stepped on the plate, and the real celebration
began.
</P>
<P>
   Like he did the day before when he hit No. 61, he picked up his
10-year-old son, Matt, a bat boy, and gave him a kiss he will never
forget. He then grabbed and hugged teammates and members of the
Maris family, who were sitting near the Cardinals' dugout. When he
climbed back on the field, he was greeted by Cubs outfielder Sammy
Sosa, who was his nearest pursuer during the chase for 62.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire then grabbed a microphone hooked up for the occasion,
and said: ``Sammy Sosa is unbelievable.'' He then thanked the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, they were dancing in the streets of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has a new hero.

BANK PROBING RELEASE OF CELLUCCI DEBT REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH   AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acting Governor Paul Cellucci's personal debt Tuesday
took center stage in an increasingly acrimonious gubernatorial
campaign, with Cellucci accusing his Republican rival Joseph D.
Malone of complicity in illegally obtaining his private credit
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The issue flared up when the Chase Manhattan Bank, of New York,
confirmed Tuesday it is investigating whether someone at the bank
illegally released credit information on Cellucci that has been
circulating among the Boston media for several months.
</P>
<P>
   A bank spokeswoman said an internal investigation was launched
two months ago after Cellucci's personal attorney called Chase with
evidence that someone at the bank had retrieved Cellucci's credit
history on at least two occasions _ March 28 and May 29 _ without
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cellucci has told the bank that credit reports for
his wife, Jan, and his father, Argeo Cellucci, a Hudson
businessman, were also obtained through the bank on two other days
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation so far has not determined we requested or
received the reports,'' said Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, vice-president
for corporate communications. ``I can say that if the reports were
accessed illegally, the person would be terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in the wake of a WHDH-TV (Channel 7) report that
focused new attention on Cellucci's debt, estimated at more than
$700,000, Cellucci and his campaign aides laid the blame on the
leak at Malone's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe Malone has an obligation to talk to all of his
consultants, all of the people helping him on his campaign, and
let's find out who broke state law, who broke federal law, and who
brought campaigning and dirty tricks to a new low in
Massachusetts,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   John Brockelman, Cellucci's deputy campaign manager, pointed an
accusatory finger at Manhattan private investigator Richard ``Bo''
Dietl, a Malone friend and fund-raiser. ``Given that last week Joe
Malone announced he was going to continue to attack Paul Cellucci's
personal finances, his close relationship with private investigator
Bo Dietl, who specializes in accessing credit reports, it raises
serious questions that deserve to be answered,'' Brockelman said.
``I smell a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in New York, Dietl, who has been quoted in news reports
boasting about his ability to obtain confidential credit reports,
denied any involvement in obtaining the records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he said when asked if he had played any role
in getting Cellucci's credit report. ``I think the governor is
hallucinating a little bit on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietl said his role with Malone had been limited to raising
$60,000 at a New York City fundraiser and arranging for his
appearance on Don Imus's nationally syndicated radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about the Cellucci campaign charge, Eric
Fehrnstrom, Malone's deputy campaign manager, accused Cellucci of
trying to divert attention away from his personal debt problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fehrnstrom refused to answer the question directly when
asked if the Malone campaign was in any way involved in the leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to respond to Paul Cellucci's ridiculous
allegations,'' Fehrnstrom said. ``I am just not going to dignify it
with a response except to say he is employing Bill Clinton-like
tactics to divert attention from his own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully obtaining and circulating someone's credit report is
a federal crime punishable by a stiff fine and a prison sentence of
up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Channel 7 aired a segment on Cellucci's debt
but the reporter, Andy Hiller, said he did not have a copy of the
actual credit report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relied on information obtained from a confidential source,''
said Hiller, who said the acting governor had neither confirmed nor
denied the accuracy of the figures he used. ``If he had said the
numbers were wrong, we would not have had a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, a source gave the Globe a purported summary
of Cellucci's personal credit report, but the newspaper declined to
use the material.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Cellucci's debt has flared just as the two
candidates are preparing to meet Wednesday night in Worcester for
their last debate before the Sept. 15 primary. With polls showing
him lagging far behind the acting governor, Malone last week said
Cellucci's personal debt is on the table for debate in the closing
days of the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has said he accumulated the debt partly as a result of
a paycut when he gave up his law practice in 1991 to become
lieutenant governor. He said also his bills mounted as he paid for
his two daughters' college education and made additions to his
Hudson home.
</P>
<P>
   Malone contends it was Cellucci's recent TV ad that attacks his
record as treasurer that led to his decision to make Cellucci's
heavy personal debt a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the Malone campaign has been engaged in a quiet
effort to plant damaging stories about Cellucci's personal finances
for months _ even back when the treasurer was publicly insisting he
wouldn't touch the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been peddling it to news organization for quite
awhile,'' said a GOP strategist, who speculates that the real
reason Malone decided to drive the issue himself is that the
campaign has concluded that it won't receive enough attention
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In the most striking example of the Malone campaign's effort to
draw attention on the debt, Charles Manning, a close Malone friend
and paid consultant to the campaign, last spring faxed a memo to
reporters outlining discrepancies in Cellucci's various
explanations for the debt and suggesting areas for the news media
to investigate. Manning declined comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another individual close to the campaign says a volunteer from
the Malone camp inspected the building permits on the acting
governor's Hudson home to investigate Cellucci's explanation that
renovation expenses had contributed substantially to the debt.
Until last week, however, Malone's public position was that while
Cellucci should offer a fuller explanation, he himself wouldn't
exploit Cellucci's personal financial woes as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the debt issue during a June 12, 1997, meeting with
Globe editors and reporters, Malone said then he would not raise
the matter, though he stopped short of ruling the issue out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In July of last year, when Globe columnist David Nyhan wrote
about Malone, Malone's stance was the same. ``Malone vows not to
make an issue of Cellucci's personal debt level,'' wrote Nyhan, who
quoted Malone saying: ``I'll let other people decide that.''

IRS NOW SAYS NO TAX ON RECORD-BREAKING BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moved in `s' category) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It ain't so, the IRS said Tuesday. The fan who
grabs the home run that breaks Roger Maris' record will not face a
huge tax bill if he or she turns the ball over to the player who
hits it.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a public relations debacle, the tax-collection agency
put out a statement Tuesday afternoon explaining the ``basic income
and gift tax principles'' that would apply to a fan who ends up
with the historic ball and returns it. Its interpretation of those
principles Tuesday was far more favorable to such a fan than the
more literal-minded interpretation that the IRS had previously said
might apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the fan in these circumstances would not have
taxable income,'' the agency said, deflating legions of IRS bashers
who had already worked themselves into a high dudgeon over reports
that the lucky fan could face a tax bill of hundreds of thousands
of dollars just for turning the ball over to Mark McGwire of the
St. Louis Cardinals or Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said snagging the ball and giving it back would, for
legal purposes, be like winning a sweepstakes but declining the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would likewise be no gift tax in these circumstances,''
the agency said, adding that the tax consequences would be
different if the fan tried to cash in by selling the ball. By some
estimates, the ball could be worth $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes pieces of the tax code can be as hard to understand
as the infield fly rule,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti.
``All I know is that the fan who gives back the home run ball
deserves a round of applause, not a big tax bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who has been trying to reshape the agency into a
customer-friendly service center for taxpayers, acted after members
of both parties in Washington took turns Tuesday mocking and
criticizing the IRS for even allowing the issue to come up.
</P>
<P>
   Although the IRS has said all along that it will have to look at
all the circumstances before determining the tax implications of
the ball that breaks the single-season record of 61 home runs, it
had done little until Tuesday to dispel the impression that it
would apply the laws and regulations strictly. Treating the
baseball like any other valuable gift would have meant slapping a
tax of as much as 40 percent of the ball's value, although the
donor could have chosen to reduce his or her liability by using the
$625,000 lifetime exemption on gifts available to all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the IRS made its announcement Tuesday, White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said the possibility of the agency's
stepping into a moment in baseball history was ``about the dumbest
thing I've ever heard in my life.'' House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri said that ``only the IRS could turn a
once-in-a-lifetime catch into a once-in-a-lifetime Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who led hearings over the last year
into abuses of taxpayers by the IRS, said he had called Rossotti
Tuesday to urge him to avoid invoking tax provisions ``that defy
common sense and are patently unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was ever even the possibility of Mark
McGwire's historical 62nd home run baseball being taxed,'' Roth
said, ``is a prime example of what is wrong with our current tax
code.''

 &HT;    Neagle expected to miss next start
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The news from the medical front back home was OK
Tuesday. No, Denny Neagle doesn't have a tear in his left rotator
cuff. Yes, the left-hander has some bursitis in his pitching
shoulder. It will probably cause Neagle to miss a second straight
start Saturday, but he should be able to resume his spot in the
rotation next week. And, more important, on into October.
</P>
<P>
   All that was determined Tuesday when Neagle, who was scratched
from his scheduled start Monday against the Mets, was examined in
Atlanta by Braves orthopedist Joe Chandler. While an MRI showed no
damage to Neagle's rotator cuff, Chandler did give him a cortisone
shot to help ease the stiffness that has plagued Neagle for a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MRI was good,'' said Braves trainer Dave Pursley. ``He had
a little injection in his labrum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little bursitis, inflammation of the bursa sac,''
said Bobby Cox. The manager isn't sure if Neagle, who's won his
last three starts, will be able to start Saturday at home against
Florida. If not, rookie Bruce Chen _ who made his major-league
debut Monday in Neagle's stead _ will start again. If so, Neagle
would take his next regular turn Sept. 16 against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With pride
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Tucker stuck in a 6-for-31 slump
(24-for-his-last-127, .189) and now hitting a season-low .249,
Curtis Pride started in right field against Expos right-hander
Miguel Batista, Pride's first start since being recalled from
Richmond Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to,'' Cox said of Pride. He has a chance to be on our
(postseason) roster. We need to get him some at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride was 0-for-1 as a pinch hitter over the weekend in New
York, grounding out on Monday. That lowered his pinch-hitting
average to .206 (7-for-34). But in his first 16 starts before
Tuesday, Pride hit .321 (17-for-53) as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Home run for Jones
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire isn't the only guy hitting lots of homers lately.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch Andruw Jones saw from Batista in the second
inning Tuesday night, he lofted his 29th home run of the season,
just over the wall in the left. It was his fifth homer in six
games, and his eighth in the last 16.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a kid who didn't hit his first homer until April
14, finished that month with four and had just 12 at the All-Star
break. On Sunday, he became the third-youngest player (21 years,
four months) to reach 50 career homers. The youngest? Hall of Famer
Mel Ott (20 years, four months), then Tony Conigliaro (20 years,
seven months).
</P>
<P>
   Why the late surge? ``I don't know,'' said Jones. ``I've been
really patient and waiting for pitchers to make a mistake. I think
the last three games (in New York), the pitchers made a mistake,
left it over the plate and high.''

LERNER, WHO HELPED BROWNS LEAVE, IS AWARDED FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Al Lerner, a Brooklyn-born credit card magnate who
helped Art Modell move the old Cleveland Browns to Baltimore in
1996, was chosen unanimously Tuesday by National Football League
owners to buy the new Browns franchise for $530 million, a record
sum for a North American sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner defeated a $500 million offer from Charles Dolan, the
chairman of Cablevision Systems, and his brother, Lawrence, a
Cleveland-area lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me how it feels to write a check for a pair of
shoes, I could tell you,'' said Lerner, the chairman of MBNA Corp.,
a giant credit card issuer, who is worth a reported $2.5 billion.
``But at this level, it's a unique experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner will make a lump-sum payment for the team, which will be
shared equally by 29 of the other teams, except for Modell's
Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't written the check yet,'' Lerner said in a
conference call from Cleveland after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the third ballot of the 30 owners, Lerner was one vote short
of the 23 required for approval. Seven teams were aligned with the
Dolan group, including the Jets, Giants and Ravens. But on a motion
by Modell, the naysayers switched to Lerner. The Oakland Raiders
abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, in the same airport hotel ballroom where NFL owners
voted to let Modell move to Baltimore, seemed to go on without
resolution as it stretched into the evening. Inside the room,
owners lobbied to continue discussion Wednesday or even next week,
as the focus of their talks centered on the Lerner and Dolan bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very respectful, positive and thoughtful
discussions, based on the positive aspects of both groups,'' said
Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner. ``There was no negative
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell, a former friend of Lerner's but now estranged from him,
was expected to speak against Lerner, but did not.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday's meeting, the league's seven-member
expansion committee considered bids from Lerner, Dolan and Howard
Milstein, the New York-based real estate developer and banker.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee decided early Tuesday not to bring Milstein's
offer, estimated to be at $450 million, before the full ownership.
A fourth bidder, Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland-area real estate
developer, was eliminated Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vote to make Lerner the owner culminates a nearly six-month
process during which the NFL fulfilled its promise to Cleveland to
bring a team back to the city by vote agreeing to bring in an
expansion team, not one relocated from another city.
</P>
<P>
   Seven bidders were originally attracted to the process, but
three dropped out last week before they submitted ``final'' bids to
the league. Since last week, the bids by the Lerner and Dolan
groups were cajoled upward by between $20 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $530 million Lerner will pay, $54 million will go to the
cost of the $280 million stadium being built on the site of old
Cleveland Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The selection culminated a process that began nearly three years
ago, after Modell announced that he was moving the old Browns to
Baltimore for a revenue-rich deal at a new stadium. Soon after, the
NFL agreed to place a new team in Cleveland, but decided only last
March to make it an expansion team, not one moved from another
city.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the largest price paid for a team if a reported
$950 million bid by Rupert Murdoch for Manchester United, the
popular English soccer team, is true.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner was a heavy favorite to win a vote Tuesday largely
because of his willingness to pay all or most of the cost of the
Browns in cash. A former bidder for an expansion franchise in
Baltimore, he had the backing of Cleveland Mayor Michael White.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein said he had not thought about whether he would pursue
buying the Washington Redskins if he lost his bid for the Browns. A
$450 million bid was recently made to buy the team and its year-old
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wolstein was the least well-heeled of the competition, and was
essentially out of the sweepstakes before Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other bidders, who were in Cleveland or New York,
Wolstein was in Italy. &QL;

ADVERTISING: 2 BIG MARKETERS WILL CONSOLIDATE PORTIONS OF THEIR
ACCOUNTS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two giant advertisers said Tuesday that they would consolidate
portions of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements by H.J. Heinz Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are
indicative of the constant consolidations of agency assignments
that have been remaking Madison Avenue for most of the decade. They
are also emblematic of the continuing efforts by large marketers to
focus on brand-building.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz, which has renewed a commitment to spend on advertising
for its grocery products, is looking to consolidate worldwide brand
duties for its Heinz ketchup at one agency. Though billings on the
account, now divided among a dozen shops, were not disclosed, they
were estimated at $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new initiative will focus our worldwide advertising
behind our flagship icon brand,'' said William Johnson, president
and chief executive at Heinz in Pittsburgh, by developing what he
described as ``a single global brand positioning that generates
excitement and growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson assumed the duties of chief executive last year
from Anthony O'Reilly, he has pressed Heinz to return to its
longtime practice of supporting brands like Heinz ketchup,
Star-Kist tuna and 9-Lives cat food with consumer ad campaigns.
Under O'Reilly, Heinz had reduced ad budgets to pay for promotions
like cents-off coupons and payments to retailers. For instance,
Heinz ketchup was advertised during Super Bowl XXXII in January,
the first time the brand appeared on national TV in almost five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they believed that the company's strategy of
spending cost savings on consumer campaigns was bearing fruit _ or
vegetables, depending on what you consider the tomato to be.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that renewed emphasis on advertising, Heinz is
unexpectedly consolidating the global ketchup account, a decision
not known publicly until the trade publications Advertising Age and
Adweek reported the move in front-page articles published Monday.
Five agencies were being considered, they reported; Heinz named two
of them as finalists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago and the TBWA
Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group in New York. Burnett had long been
Heinz's primary American agency, creating characters like Charlie
the tuna for Star-Kist and Morris the cat for 9-Lives. But Burnett
and Heinz parted ways on American assignments in 1994 after
domestic ad spending had dwindled to $8 million from $65 million in
1988. Burnett has continued as a Heinz agency in Europe and Latin
America on products like seafood.
</P>
<P>
   TBWA, parent of TBWA Chiat/Day, has not worked directly for
Heinz; its newly reorganized British agency, TBWA GGT Simons Palmer
in London, creates campaigns or Heinz/Farley's infant feeding
products in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The three agencies eliminated from the ketchup review were:
Bates Worldwide in New York, part of Cordiant Communications Group
PLC; DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, a unit of Omnicom, and Euro
RSCG Worldwide in Paris, owned by Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Bates British agency, Bates Dorland in London, handles Heinz
ketchup there. The Chicago office of DDB Needham handles Heinz
ketchup in the United States as well as brands like Heinz gravy and
Ore-Ida frozen foods; a sibling, DDB Needham San Francisco, was
named last month as the agency for the Smart Ones line of frozen
entrees and desserts sold by Heinz's Weight Watchers Gourmet Food
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Euro RSCG office in London was recently awarded a
pan-European assignment to advertise Heinz ketchup. Those
commercials, carrying the theme ``All the world says Heinz,'' began
running last week as the review got under way.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the ketchup account could come in two or three
weeks, said Ted Smyth, a spokesman for Heinz. Asked whether it
augured similar steps for other important worldwide Heinz brands,
he replied: ``It's too early to say. We are moving to category
management of our big brands, in tuna and weight control. That's
part of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard named Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in San Francisco, a
unit of Publicis SA in Paris, to handle a consolidated worldwide
branding assignment for personal computers and PC servers. Though
billings for the campaign, to appear in Europe and North America,
have not been determined, Advertising Age estimated them at as much
as $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to crank up the volume on PC's and be a little more
competitive and aggressive,'' said Jan McDaniel, marketing
communications manager for North America at Hewlett-Packard in
Cupertino, Calif. ``Advertising is one of the weapons we'll use.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Hewlett-Packard
would consolidate worldwide duties for PCs and servers, with
billings estimated at more than $200 million, at Publicis, which
handles the PC product account in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDaniel labeled the report inaccurate because of
suggestions that another Hewlett-Packard agency, the Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, would lose all its
assignments to Publicis. Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi San Francisco will
continue working for Hewlett-Packard on such accounts as Unix
servers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the billings estimate, Ms. McDaniel said, laughing, ``If
it is a $200 million account, I need to have a very big promotion
and a raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi San Francisco also handles the PC product
account in North America. That assignment, Advertising Age
reported, was likely to move to Riney at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC issued a statement Tuesday describing the
loss to Publicis as ``less than 10 percent of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
worldwide Hewlett-Packard billings, which are in excess of $100
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicis has been aggressively publicizing account gains and
acquisitions to raise its profile among worldwide agency companies.
In this instance, though, the confusion over the Hewlett-Packard
assignment may have been counterproductive.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AMERICAN EXPRESS CHECKS TO BE ISSUED IN EUROS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
(bl) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Express said Tuesday that it would print
euro-denominated traveler's checks in time for sales to start on
Jan. 1, 1999, the beginning of the European Monetary Union. While
the euro becomes the official currency of the 11-nation euro-zone
Jan. 1, with national currency exchange rates fixed to the euro,
the circulation of euro notes and coins will not begin until Jan.
1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year transition, consumers will be able to use
the American Express euro traveler's checks _ in denominations of
50, 100 and 200 euro _ to pay for goods and services while
merchants begin to convert to euro pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the euro-denominated traveler's checks to be
accepted by local merchants as soon as they begin pricing their
products in euros,'' said Victoria Handwerk, an American Express
spokeswoman. ``But during the transition, American Express
traveler's checks, as always, can be cashed for local currency if
desired at our travel service offices within the euro-zone.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the euro traveler's checks would enable purchasers
to travel anywhere in the euro-zone without having to worry about
multiple currencies. The euro-zone countries are Germany, France,
Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland and Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The new traveler's checks will have a pastel-colored world map
on the front and acceptance instructions in English, French and
German on the back. They will include security features like those
on dollar-denominated checks.
</P>
<P>
   The euro-denominated checks will be available worldwide
beginning Jan. 1, 1999, at American Express travel service offices,
at some financial institutions, exchange bureaus and travel
agencies, including the American and Canadian Automobile
Associations. In the United States, American Express card holders
will be able to order the euro checks by telephone (800 221-7282)
for delivery by mail after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   During the transition, American Express traveler's checks will
also be available in local currencies, and will be valid
indefinitely. But national currencies and national-currency
traveler's checks will not be sold after June 30, 2002, when the
euro will become the only legal currency used in the participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Coping With the Strike
</P>
<P>
   While the strike against Northwest Airlines continues to
inconvenience travelers in the Midwest, business travelers appear
to be taking it more or less in stride.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted last Wednesday through Friday among corporate
travel managers by the National Business Travel Association found
that 63 percent of those surveyed had been affected by the strike,
but that more than 77 percent had rebooked on other major carriers
in anticipation of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 22 percent of corporate travel managers surveyed said
that during the strike they had turned to low-fare carriers, niche
carriers or new-entrant carriers. And of those, more than 65
percent said they would consider moving the rebooked travel
permanently to alternate carriers.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, 57 percent of the travel managers do not want
President Clinton to intervene formally in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   No-Paper Ticketing Abroad
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months United Airlines plans to extend its
electronic ticketing service to Singapore; three cities in China
(Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong); Belgium; France; Germany; Italy,
and the Netherlands. The addition of those 7 nations will bring to
12 the number of foreign countries using United e-mail. Australia,
Canada, Japan and New Zealand were added this year, while Britain
was put on line last October.
</P>
<P>
   United said that the use of its E-tickets, which allow
passengers to board planes without paper tickets, reached an
all-time industry high of 3.4 million last month. During that
month, 56 percent of eligible itineraries were ticketed
electronically, an increase of almost 11 percent over August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are reluctant to disclose the exact amount of money
they save with E-tickets compared with paper tickets, because
estimated savings per E-ticket range all over the tarmac. But it is
generally believed that the major airlines save about $10 million a
month each, which of course explains their eagerness to expand
electronic ticketing as far and as fast as possible.

 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, finds himself facing two months
of campaigning over uncertain ground for a party whose leader is up
to his eyeballs in scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that the situation is impossible to gauge,''
said Frost, a 10-term congressman. ``We'll know a lot more in the
next couple of weeks. But I think it's going to be a very
late-developing election.''
</P>
<P>
   His main sources of solace, he says, are that he thinks the
Democrats still have several shots at wresting seats from
Republicans, that campaign fund-raising does not seem to have been
affected by the scandal and that the ground is just as uncertain
for his opponents, who must guard against appearing to place
partisanship above statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The calls Frost has been getting in recent days from nervous and
excited candidates have tended to fall into two categories, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incumbents are concerned about what's going to happen in the
next month, with the release of Ken Starr's report and what
Congress might do about it,'' he said. ``The new candidates, who
are just trying to get into office, want to talk about the issues
we've developed and how they're resonating in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, a lawyer and former journalist who represents the heavily
black and Hispanic neighborhoods of south Dallas and south Fort
Worth along with a bunch of white suburbs in between, said he had
better answers for the newcomers than for the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that you can't tell at this point what's going
to happen in the next month,'' he said. ``And I don't know _ nobody
knows _ how the people are going to respond to whatever comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, many Democrats were predicting that the strong
national economy combined with widespread disapproval of Starr's
approach to his investigation of President Clinton would redound in
the party's favor, helping win back a few more of the seats that
were lost in the conservative Republican landslide of 1994.
Democrats even harbored hopes of retaking control of the House,
where a net gain of only 11 seats would restore their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Frost says that his position throughout the year has been that
the Democrats stand a 50-50 chance of winning back House control,
and that he sees nothing as yet to cause that outlook to change.
But voicing optimism is part of Frost's job as head of the party's
congressional campaign effort, and even he is not immune to the
unease that is growing among Democrats with Starr's report to
Congress expected as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Democrats will turn out in November,''
Frost said. ``Most people's view about the Clinton investigation
seems to be, Can't we get this behind us, can't we get this over
with? People are just turned off politics. Thus, it becomes an
issue of which side can get its base into the voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   He rattled off the uncertainties: How much of the Starr report
will be made fully public? Will congressional impeachment hearings
be held, and, if so, will they begin before or after November? What
further sordid details might come out? Will the president say more
than he already has? And, most perplexing of all in a climate where
the president's job approval ratings have remained high despite all
the disclosures, will any of it make the slightest difference to
voters?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to tell how it's going to go,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   For Labor Day, Frost's staff had him on a busy campaign kickoff
in and around his home district: a breakfast with labor leaders at
a downtown Dallas hotel, a barbecue lunch with an auditorium full
of workers at a union hall in a suburb north of Fort Worth, then a
sun-baked picnic in a wooded area called Flagpole Hill in the urban
sprawl of northeast Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   As in most political circles, the fallout from the president's
troubles was a matter of much debate. Former Speaker Jim Wright,
who for 35 years represented the Fort Worth district where the
union hall is situated, was knocking back a plate of barbecue on
the other side of the hall while Frost worked the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, the situation is so volatile it's hard to make
an intelligent judgment,'' said Wright, who resigned from the
speakership and from Congress while under fire over ethics in 1989.
``I don't think I've ever seen a situation quite like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   In one measure of the president's political health, Frost
asserted that requests from candidates for Clinton to visit their
districts had held fairly steady: Some candidates want him to come,
some do not. It depends on the district and the dynamics of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' congressional campaign committee is in the midst
of a series of joint fund-raising events with the party's Senate
campaign committee and the Democratic National Committee; the next
one is planned for next Monday in New York. That event had a goal
of $3 million, but some $3.2 million has already been raised for
it, Frost said, leading some to predict that as much as $3.5
million will eventually come in.
</P>
<P>
   And Frost said his reports from the field showed that those
Republican seats the Democrats believe they have the strongest
chance of winning continued to be within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate in several instances that Republicans who
got elected in 1994 promising to abide by six-year term limits are
now just two years away from when they'd either have to drop out or
break their promise,'' he said. ``So some of them are leaving early
to run for another office, opening up some promising opportunities
for us.''

<P>
   Worldly Manner, a five-length winner in the Best Pal Stakes
earlier in the season, will be a heavy favorite to win the $250,000
Del Mar Futurity for 2-year-olds today, closing day at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   If Worldly Manner succeeds, he'll be joined in the winner's
circle by some familiar faces. Owners John and Betty Mabee of
Golden Eagle Farm have won the Futurity four times in the 1990s,
with Best Pal (1990), River Special (1992), Winning Pact (1993) and
Souvenir Copy (1997). Trainer Bob Baffert won the race with Silver
Charm (1996) and Souvenir Copy. Jockey Kent Desormeaux rode winner
Future Quest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux replaces Gary Stevens, who is sidelined following
knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert tries to clinch his second straight Del Mar training
title. With 16 winners, he leads Barry Abrams by one and Bob Hess
Jr. by two. Corey Nakatani has wrapped up his second Del Mar riding
title.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, a son of Riverman, has won two of his three
starts. He'll be joined in a Golden Eagle-owned entry with unbeaten
Daring General. The seven-horse field for the 7-furlong race
includes D. Wayne Lukas-trained Hidden City, winner of the Ellis
Park Juvenile in Kentucky, and rider Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Del Mar Futurity has sent three of its winners on to
Kentucky Derby victories: Tomy Lee (1958), Gato del Sol (1981) and
Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Fairplex Park opens its Los Angeles County Fair season Thursday
for 18 straight days of racing. First post will be 12:30 p.m. each
day.

EXCERPTS FROM LETTERS BY KENDALL AND STARR
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-SCHOOL.) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an exchange of letters
between the independent counsel Kenneth Starr and President
Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, about Kendall's request for an
advance copy of any report Starr submits to Congress on his
investigation of the president:
</P>
<P>
   From Kendall on Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Although I do not know whether recent media accounts that your
Office is preparing a ``report'' to Congress pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
595(c) are accurate, I am writing to request that, if you are
indeed contemplating such a ``report,'' we be given a brief
opportunity to review it before it is transmitted. We make this
request to ensure that this first step in the most serious process
contemplated by our Constitution is taken with due consideration
for fundamental fairness.
</P>
<P>
   This concern for fairness was shared by then-Chief Judge Sirica
24 years ago, when he was presented with a report of the Watergate
grand jury. The Watergate Special Prosecutor asked that this report
be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee of the House of
Representatives, which was then conducting an impeachment
investigation, and Judge Sirica did so, but only after carefully
reviewing it and finding that President Nixon would not be
prejudiced. ...
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Sirica's desire to ensure that the Watergate report
was fair and, in particular, that it contained no recommendations,
advice or judgments that would infringe on the prerogatives of the
legislative branch parallels our concern that any transmission to
the Congress comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. 595(c), that
you advise the Congress only of any ``substantial and credible
information ... that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.''
Nothing in that statute authorizes your office to prepare a
``report'' to the House that purports to summarize and analyze
evidence. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the OIC does decide to transmit to the House of
Representatives not merely the ``information'' it has gathered but
some form of ``report'' or summary containing any factual and legal
analysis or conclusions, we believe that fundamental fairness
dictates that we have the opportunity to review such a document and
submit simultaneously any reply we wish to make. To that end, I
request that you first allow the President's personal and White
House counsel to review any draft ``report'' prepared by your
Office ostensibly pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 595(c), affording us one
week to submit a written reply, which would be submitted to the
Chief Judge together with your draft document, for possible
transmission to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   From Starr on Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   As you doubtless know, this Office steadily has maintained the
position that it would not be appropriate to comment on the
possibility that it would provide a ``report'' to Congress under 28
U.S.C. 595(c). ...
</P>
<P>
   The statute imposes an obligation on me in specified
circumstances to provide certain information to the House of
Representatives and I will endeavor to satisfy that obligation. ...
</P>
<P>
   As an initial matter, let me address your concern that a
``report'' should not ``summarize or analyze evidence.'' Your
reading of the law is, with all respect, at odds with its language
and its intent. As a linguistic matter, Section 595(c) mandates
that an independent counsel ``shall'' provide ``any substantial and
credible information'' that ``may constitute grounds for
impeachment.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Turning to your suggestion that you be permitted to review a
``report'' (if any) prior to its transmittal, I am persuaded that
such a course is precluded by the statutory language and history of
Section 595(c). In my view, it is for Congress, the repository of
the impeachment power, to decide if and when such information
should be provided to your client. I anticipate that any
information this Office may provide to the House of Representatives
under the authority of Section 595(c) would be provided in a sealed
manner, for the House to release as it sees fit. ...

NECE NOT FOLLOWING IN DAD'S FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First, Ronnie Lott's son picked UCLA over USC.
Now, he's playing linebacker instead of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, unlike son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my dad was kind of surprised,'' Bruins freshman Ryan
Nece said of the reaction to his offseason move from safety to
linebacker. ``The whole family was surprised. Everybody had this
stereotypical picture in their heads about what an inside
linebacker should look like: Dick Butkus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once I explained what (defense) UCLA ran and why I
switched, they felt it was a good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece, an honor roll student, realized playing time was scarce
behind All-American strong safety Larry Atkins and agreed to try
inside linebacker. He was UCLA's most-improved defensive player in
training camp and is currently second-string, behind junior Ramogi
Huma.
</P>
<P>
   What Nece lacks in size _ at 210 pounds, he's tiny for the
position _ he makes up for in quickness and smarts. One of his
first moves was to ask dad for advice, and Lott, the legendary USC
and San Francisco 49ers safety, was happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a few tips,'' said Nece, a San Bernardino native
who chose UCLA over Washington because he felt comfortable with the
coaching staff. (USC did not recruit him.)
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he told me to do was sit on my knees and practice
hitting a wall with my hands (in an upward thrusting motion). That
helped me learn to stay low when I tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece, who uses his mother's maiden name, learned the position
quickly and added 10 pounds of muscle in the offseason. He'll get
plenty of playing time Saturday against Texas, as the Bruins will
rotate nine linebackers in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased with Ryan,'' inside linebackers coach
Marc Dove said. ``He keeps elevating his performance with every
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Lott has any complaints, he can take them to his former
position coach at USC _ Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Second-string nose guard Ken Kocher, one of
UCLA's top freshmen, has recovered from a sprained ankle and will
play against Texas. How much _ and when _ will depend on the ankle
and game circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Low numbers: Don't count on quarterback Cade McNown matching the
numbers posted Saturday by his Heisman competitors. UCLA's run-pass
balance does not allow for 50 attempts, and Toledo won't permit
seven touchdowns (ie: Kentucky's Tim Couch).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to (pad McNown's stats) at the expense of him
getting hurt,'' Toledo said. ``And I'm not going to do it at the
expense of running up the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a spark?: The punt and kick returners have been
established. Freddie Mitchell will handle punt return duties, while
Mitchell, Jermaine Lewis and DeShaun Foster will share the kickoff
returns.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA ranked seventh in the Pacific-10 in kickoff returns last
year and last in punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to people,'' Toledo said. ``Great return teams
have great returners.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregame walk: In following a Toledo-era tradition, the Bruins
will arrive at the Rose Bowl at 10:30 a.m. Saturday and immediately
walk through the crowd gathered near the Food Zone in area H.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets our players emotional and gets fans into the game,''
Toledo said.

HINGIS MAKES QUICK WORK OF SELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-USOPEN) 
(mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not that she is jaded: Martina Hingis delights
in winning matches. Any matches, anywhere. But it takes a special
occasion like Tuesday night's 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Monica Seles in
their windblown U.S. Open quarterfinal to provoke the 17-year-old
sophisticate to leap with joy as punctuation to a soul-satisfying
victory.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Hingis _ who wore her hair scraped into the
customized Samurai topknot favored by the Open's other defending
champion, Patrick Rafter _ cranked out an ace on her first match
point than she jumped into the air as if she intended to ride a
pogo stick out of Arthur Ashe Stadium. Had a horse been handy, the
avid rider would have leaped aboard it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Just two rounds from a victory that would make her the youngest
U.S. Open champion to mount a successful title defense, Hingis was
in a mood to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also halted Hingis' two-match losing streak to
Seles, a tiny streak of futility that caused no shortage of
irritation to Hingis, who considers it inexcusable to drop a match
to the same person twice. After absorbing semifinal defeats at both
Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, a development she terms a
setback when compared to her acquisition of three of the four Grand
Slam crowns in 1997, Hingis has been particularly keen on defending
her turf at this Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I haven't done as well as last year, but life goes on,
and now I'm in the semifinals same as last year,'' said Hingis, who
immediately set her sights on using this semifinal, where she will
face the Wimbledon champion, Jana Novotna, to exact revenge for her
loss to Novotna in that semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Played in autumnal conditions, the quarterfinal took just 72
minutes and was nudged toward its brisk conclusion by 26 unforced
errors from Seles. Seles had trouble keeping her forehands _
whether she was using her traditional two-fisted technique or the
more flexible but less reliable one-hander she has worked into her
repertory _ within bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some points where it was hard to control the
ball,'' Seles said of the navigational problems caused by the wind.
``I felt lost this entire tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles netted forehands at set point of the opening set and at
break point of the first game of the second set. Though she
reflexively broke right back to put the second set back on serve at
1-1, Hingis broke her again for a 4-3 lead, then held at love for
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in that she wanted to win this match really
badly,'' Seles said. ``She raised her level, I went down a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Not known for her merciful side, Hingis didn't let her childhood
idolization of Seles interfere with her professional domination of
the former No. 1 when their rivalry began in the 1996 Oakland
final.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis ran up her career mastery over Seles to 5-0 before Seles
finally picked a pivotal spot, their 1998 French Open semifinal, to
break out of her slump against the savvy Swiss teenager, who
continues to count the French Open as the only Grand Slam title to
evade her.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, owner of the Roland Garros title from 1990-92, walloped
Hingis by 6-3, 6-2 to end Hingis' winning streak against her, and
when they met two weeks ago in the Canadian Open final, Seles
prevailed in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 comeback that trimmed her deficit to
5-2.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seles, whose sixth-seeded position was her lowest
at the Open since she made her debut in 1989, Hingis is a hard
player to knock off course, especially at a Grand Slam where she
has a title defense to inspire her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really psyched up for it,'' Seles said.

 &HT;    Lerner awarded Browns; Policy CEO after $530 million bid
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only two months after he resigned as president of the San
Francisco 49ers to pursue a role with a resurrected Cleveland
Browns franchise, Carmen Policy is back in the NFL. His proven
acumen, perhaps more than the record revenues the Browns are
expected to generate and the additional draft choices they will
receive in their first two years of existence, could translate into
quick success in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just the first step,'' said credit card magnate Al
Lerner, after he was chosen Tuesday night as the Browns owner.
``But in Carmen, we've got a CEO who has scaled all those other
steps pretty successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy will serve as president and chief executive officer of
the Browns and will own a 10-percent stake in the team. When he
joined the Lerner bid following his departure from the 49ers, the
pair immediately became the unofficial favorites to land the team.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Lerner, who once owned 5 percent of the old
Browns, already had put money in NFL owners' coffers by placing
team logos on credit cards. More significant on Tuesday was that
Lerner, 65, also outbid the other suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Super Bowls was tremendous, but this rates right
with them,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Including a $54 million subsidy for Cleveland's new stadium, the
Lerner bid was worth $530 million. Although far shy of the $1
billion price tag urged by owners Al Davis of Oakland, Jerry Jones
of Dallas and Tampa Bay's Malcolm Glazer, the fee still represents
the most ever paid for a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner was the unanimous recommendation of the finance
committee, which considered the bids of three groups.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Larry and Charles Dolan, whose group included Hall of
Fame coach Don Shula, bid $500 million. The bid of Howard Milstein
was believed to be $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Owners met for nearly six hours and it took four ballots for
Lerner-Policy to get the 23 votes necessary for approval.

SWEDES CARRY CAMARADERIE INTO QUARTERFINAL ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Bjorn Borg was gliding ruthlessly and quietly
along the baseline, the U.S. Open was the brash and rambunctious
place where Swedes could not win. But Mats Wilander broke the mold
in 1988; Stefan Edberg grinded it into small pieces in 1991 and
1992 and now a new generation of Swedish men is doing more damage
on the hardcourts of the National Tennis Center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them reached the quarterfinals Tuesday: Jonas Bjorkman,
Magnus Larsson and, most surprisingly, Thomas Johansson. The last
time three Swedes made it this far at Flushing Meadows was in 1985,
when Wilander, Edberg and Joakim Nystrom reached the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Professional tennis can be a relentlessly individualistic
enterprise, but the Swedes approach it differently. They break
bread together, break down opponents' strengths and weaknesses
together and, on occasion, break training together. Such closeness
is the product of a culture that emphasizes cooperation and
egalitarianism, and it also stems from the fact that it is nice to
speak your own language and understand all the jokes during dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to help each other as good as we can; I mean we're very
good friends, both on the court and off,'' said Johansson, who
upset 11th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6
(8-6), to reach his first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman and Larsson, the pivotal figures in Sweden's 5-0 rout
of the United States in last year's Davis Cup final, are no
strangers to the later stages of their sport's premier events. The
tightly wound and remarkably quick Bjorkman reached the semifinals
here last year, his finest year as a professional, and was also a
quarterfinalist in 1994. According to Goran Ivanisevic, he is best
returner in the game, and Ivanisevic serves hard enough to know.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman is unusually extroverted for a Swedish tennis star, and
is one of the star acts at the players' annual talent show in Monte
Carlo because of his ability to imitate service motions. Bjorkman
can rock like Boris Becker and twitch like John McEnroe, and
Tuesday he put on another fine performance, winning by 6-4, 2-6,
6-2, 6-2 over Jan Siemerink, the net-charging Dutchman, who had
beaten him at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring to No. 4 in the world last season, Bjorkman had
struggled since reaching the Australian Open quarterfinals in
January, but he has found his form at Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   So has the absent-minded Larsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnus is the kind of guy who can walk out of the house
wearing two left shoes,'' Bjorkman said.
</P>
<P>
   With his powerful forehand and serve and deceptively lumbering
gait, the 6-foot-4-inch Larsson reached the quarterfinals here in
1993 and again last year. But after celebrating Sweden's Davis Cup
victory in December, his luck began to turn. Shortly after he
returned home to Vaxjo, Sweden, the car he had rented and parked in
front of his house was destroyed by a small bomb. Swedish police
have been unable to determine who planted it, but Larsson's coach,
Carl-Axel Hageskog, believes it was a prank.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, Larsson fell ill with what he thought was a
virus after playing in a tournament in Qatar. While doctors kept
taking blood tests and finding little that was conclusive, it took
Larsson four months to regain full health and strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stomach kept saying no to food,'' Hageskog said. ``He went
into the French Open with no training behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Larsson is on his game, he is one of the opponents that
seeded players least like to face. After upsetting No. 2 Marcelo
Rios in the third round, he kept his concentration in the fourth
round Tuesday against 92d-ranked Oliver Gross of Germany, winning
by 6-4, 7-5, 5-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman and Larsson both live in tax-free Monaco, but they both
keep close ties to Vaxjo. Bjorkman grew up there, and Larsson moved
there as a teen-ager. Vaxjo is also Wilander's hometown, and it is
Wilander, not Borg, who has had the biggest influence on this new
generation of Swedes. Bjorkman played at the same club and was 10
when Wilander won the French Open in 1982. Johansson was 7 and came
from a different city, Linkoping, but the impact was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been my idol,'' the 23-year-old Johansson said.

COORDINATOR KEEPS PANIC OUT OF THE GAME PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been easy for Ray Sherman to fall into the trap,
the one that grabs a new coach by the throat and makes him do
things he does not want to do. The one that creates pressure to
make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Chan Gailey, the new Dallas head coach, used
to be Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator. Few know that Ray Sherman
_ 46 years old, a nine-year National Football League assistant
coach, a former receiver at Fresno State _ replaced Gailey in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sherman's debut on Sunday when Pittsburgh visited the
Baltimore Ravens. The game was a knockdown showdown early, a 3-3
tie at halftime. There Pittsburgh sat with all of those
silky-smooth offensive weapons, sparked by quarterback Kordell
Stewart, and no touchdowns to show for it. The temptation for
Sherman could have been to wing it, to try to bust the game open,
to throw the football and throw it some more and let loose with his
imagination and playbook. Through his coach's headset, to attempt
to create the winning spark with big-play-calling overkill.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Steelers, Sherman stayed cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled running the ball in the first half, but in the
second half we wanted to keep running it because that's what we are
and that's what we do,'' Sherman said. ``I know that when you get
away from your identity that bad things can happen. The Steelers
had a system intact when I came here, and we want to continue that
system. It's one of those physical offenses where running the ball
takes care of the passing game and helps create it. This team on
offense and defense is just going to hit you in the mouth. That's
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hit 'em in the mouth. And that's how Pittsburgh won it, 20-13,
spoiling the Ravens' debut in their new stadium. Of course, they
had plenty of help from the Ravens, especially a botched snap of a
punt that gave Pittsburgh the ball at the Ravens' 5-yard line and
helped set up the game's first touchdown, a 1-yard run by Stewart
that gave Pittsburgh a 13-3 lead with 2 minutes 6 seconds left in
the third quarter. But it was Sherman's steady hand with the
offense that helped the Steelers continue to build momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers passed 19 times and ran 11 times in the first half.
In the second half, they ran 18 times and passed only 8 times. And
that run-first mentality helped the Steelers set up the Ravens. It
set up a play-action pass _ Stewart faking to Jerome Bettis and
then completing a 20-yard strike into the end zone to receiver
Charles Johnson with 10 minutes left _ that provided the winning
points.
</P>
<P>
   The call was timely. A first-and-10 pass from the Ravens' 20
after three consecutive, powerful Bettis runs of 9, 0 and 1 yards.
The run set up the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Purely the Steelers' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were having some success stopping our running game, but
we kept at it with the idea that we could suck them up into the run
and take a shot somewhere along the way,'' Sherman said. ``On that
play, Charles Johnson did a good job of getting free and getting to
the ball and holding on. That game could have easily gone either
way, but it went the right way for us. I learned a long time ago in
this league that you've got to appreciate every victory and cherish
them because they do not come easily. On the road, too, in the
opener? It was special.''

<P>
   It was that way on Sunday, too, for Gailey, as Dallas beat
Arizona by 38-10; for Kippy Brown, as Miami beat Indianapolis by
24-15, and for Jimmy Raye as Kansas City beat Oakland by 28-8.
Gailey calls the plays for Dallas. Brown and Raye are offensive
coordinators calling the plays for their teams. They were among the
newcomers, like Sherman, who won in their debuts while calling the
offensive shots. Each made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman was the offensive coordinator with the Jets under Pete
Carroll in 1994. His resume includes stops as an offensive coach
with Houston, Atlanta, San Francisco and Minnesota. He came to
Pittsburgh from Minnesota, where for the last three seasons he was
the quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Gailey left for Dallas, Bill Cowher, the Steelers' head
coach, called the Vikings and asked for permission to interview
Sherman. Often in the NFL, head coaches hire assistants whom they
know personally. Something about Sherman intrigued Cowher even
though he did not know him well.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Sherman's cool, even then.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is at home against Chicago on Sunday. Another chance
for Sherman to tinker, not toy. ``When I played receiver, I wasn't
a finesse receiver,'' Sherman said, laughing. ``I had to block. I
had to hit 'em in the mouth. I feel right at home here.''

 McCAUGHEY ROSS STARTING TV SPOTS IN GOVERNOR'S RACE  
(th) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a long delay, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross is
to release her first major television advertisement Wednesday in a
last-minute attempt to persuade Democratic primary voters that she
is a formidable candidate despite the problems that have plagued
her gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements come a week after she announced that her
husband, Wilbur Ross Jr., a wealthy investment banker, withdrew
$2.25 million that he had donated to her campaign, forcing her to
scale it back sharply.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross said the 30-second spot, along with another that
is to premiere Thursday, would be broadcast daily through the Sept.
15 primary in New York City and other major markets around the
state. Both advertisements take advantage of the fact that
McCaughey Ross is the only woman in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, McCaughey Ross is shown talking with a group of
women while a female voice proclaims that ``the stereotype is dead
wrong'' _ referring to her opponents' characterization of her as
erratic. And in the second, McCaughey Ross says, ``I've taken a lot
of hits lately,'' adding, ``some below the belt.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, McCaughey Ross said she felt that it
was important for her advertisements to acknowledge the
difficulties she has faced, from her recent financial woes to her
opponents calling her ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard the words,'' she said. ``There has been a lot of
focus on personality, rather than on what I'm about. I want the
people of New York state to judge me based on what I've done with
my life instead of the irrelevant, trivial descriptions that are
often offered.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross was Gov. George Pataki's Republican running mate
in 1994, but she battled with him from the outset. After a split
with Pataki, she switched parties last year. She has weathered
frequent attacks from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, she was thought to be the strongest Democratic
candidate, because her husband had promised so much money and
because she was the only woman in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But recent independent polls suggest that she has been overtaken
by Peter Vallone, the New York City Council speaker. The other
candidates in the Democratic primary are Charles Hynes, the
Brooklyn district attorney, and James Larocca, a former state
transportation commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross said she spent more than $500,000 on her two
advertisements, but she would not disclose the exact amount. She
was able to purchase the advertising because Ross returned $500,000
to the campaign late last week.
</P>
<P>
   If Ross had not made the last-minute donation, his wife's
campaign would have been left with $45,000, according to campaign
financial records.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement that is to premiere Wednesday is clearly an
appeal to women and blue-collar voters, whom McCaughey Ross says
are her strongest supporters. It shows a picture of her father and
points out that he was a factory worker. It also shows a picture of
McCaughey Ross surrounded by her three daughters. At several
points, the words ``Elect Women Now'' flash on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the second spot, McCaughey Ross talks about improving
education and making schools safer. First, though, she stares into
the camera and says that the ``hits'' she has taken are ``nothing
compared to the challenges facing most families.''
 &UR; This is the basic format and coding. Obviously, make sure you
change the actual numbers for each category according to the latest
report from business. &LR;  &QL;

   MARKET-REBOUND (Los Angeles) -- What a difference a week makes.

rates to protect the U.S. economy from the effects of a global

 &HT;    Fox, WGN also a part of history
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox wasn't on the air for Mark McGwire's historic 61st homer,
but the network will have its baseball logo on footage of No. 62.
WGN will also have clips with its logo included.
</P>
<P>
   But because Fox was the carrier of the game on ``free TV,'' the
majority of viewers in America heard Joe Buck exclaim: ``Down the
left field line! Is it enough? Gone! There it is! Sixty-two! Touch
first, Mark! You are the new single-season home run king.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that declaration, Buck and his partners Tim McCarver
and Bob Brenly smartly zipped their lips and let the pictures tell
the story for the next four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in television you have to lay out, and if ever there
was a time to lay out, that was it,'' McCarver said later in the
telecast. ``When he went to hug Roger Maris' family, Bob and I both
nearly lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox certainly captured all the appropriate shots: McGwire having
to go back and touch first base on his historic home-run trot;
getting a hug from Cubs catcher Scott Servais at the plate; picking
up his 10-year-old son Matt and being mobbed by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There were the reaction shots of the gracious Sammy Sosa,
including the Cubs slugger leaving his position in right field to
come over and hug McGwire. In fact, about the only shot of
significance that escaped Fox's coverage was the reaction of Cubs
pitcher Steve Trachsel, which should have been shown on replay like
that of Cardinals' manager Tony LaRussa as the ball cleared the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcers resumed speaking, Buck marked the time as
8:18 p.m. Central Time and said it couldn't happen to a better man;
McCarver noted it did not have the typical height of a McGwire home
run; while Brenly pointed out baseball did not want the homer to
stop the game, ``but the emotion of the moment was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, McCarver likened the night to ``the
seventh game of the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Steve Lyons also did his part by interviewing Tim
Forneris, a member of the Cardinals ground crew who retrieved the
ball and commissioner Bud Selig. Buck also gave viewers a reason to
stay tuned by announcing several times McGwire would be interviewed
after the game.

 &HT;    Another un-Madduxlike performance; Braves lose to Expos 6-3
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For both the Braves and Greg Maddux, life got worse
Tuesday. On a cold, rain-delayed evening in Olympic Stadium, Maddux
gave up four first-inning runs and Atlanta never recovered, losing
6-3 to the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' fifth loss in six games (and seven of nine) dropped
Maddux's record since the All-Star break to 5-6. His ERA in that
span: 3.34, after giving up six hits and six runs (five earned) in
seven innings Tuesday. While Maddux (17-8) struck out nine and
passed the 2,000 mark in career strikeouts, he also walked four as
Atlanta's September swoon worsened to 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   After a lost weekend in New York, the Braves were determined to
get themselves, and Greg Maddux, back on track. At the All-Star
break, Maddux was 12-2 with a 1.54 ERA, named the NL's starting
pitcher in the All-Star Game and seemed destined for his fifth Cy
Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   But since the break, Maddux had gone just 5-5, with an ERA of
3.06. In two of his last three starts (Aug. 23 against Los Angeles,
last Wednesday against Houston), he'd allowed three homers _ the
first three-homer games of his career. This night, against the
lowly Expos, at least Maddux kept the ball in the park.
</P>
<P>
   He was staked to a quick 1-0 lead on walks to Marty Malloy and
Chipper Jones, a passed ball and Andres Galarraga's grounder which
scored Malloy. Maddux had retired the first Expo before giving up a
single to Terry Jones. He was ahead of Shane Andrews 0-1 when the
drizzle in which the game began became a downpour. Another game,
another rain delay, this one for an hour and 14 minutes. When
Maddux came back out, the chill (game-time temperature: 63, and
falling rapidly), the mound (muddy and slick, later coated with new
dirt) and the Expos all conspired against Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Andrews. After Chipper Jones let a tough-hop grounder
go beneath his glove for a run-scoring error, Maddux walked Brad
Fullmer. Maddux, two walks in one inning? It got worse. Chris
Widger singled in a run. Maddux forced in a run when, on a 1-2
pitch, he hit F.P. Santangelo in the upper left arm. When Orlando
Cabrera lined another hard single to right, it was 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux finally got out of the inning when he got Expos starter
Miguel Batista looking _ the 2,000th strikeout of Maddux's career _
and Wilton Guerrero on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   When Andruw Jones' high fly ball kept going and dropped just
over the left field wall in the second, it was the fourth straight
game in which he'd homered. His 29th homer was also his fifth in 18
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maddux retired the side in order in the second, he had
problems again in the third. He appeared to have trouble with his
footing on the mound. A leadoff walk, two more singles and another
walk scored two Expos for a 6-2 Montreal lead. The rain returned,
worsened, then let up before Ryan Klesko doubled leading off the
sixth and scored on Ozzie Guillen's two-out single to cut it to
6-3.

   ST. LOUIS _ On a dreamy night in a steamy baseball city, the
sport whose tradition is built largely on numbers introduced
perhaps its grandest Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   Soak it up, America: The mighty McGwire has gone deep one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire ripped a fastball
over the left-field fence at Busch Stadium and became the
single-season home run leader, breaking Roger Maris' 37-year-old
record of 61 that most of the baseball world thought would never be
touched.
</P>
<P>
   The homer came off Chicago Cubs right-hander Steve Trachsel in
the fourth inning. It was measured at 341 feet, McGwire's shortest
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The home run and McGwire's pursuit of the record will be
remembered forever. The excitement captured the nation and provided
a rebirth for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed in an area underneath the stands and never made
it into the seats. It was quickly picked up by a Cardinals'
groundskeeper and brought to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The homer touched off a wild celebration at Busch Stadium.
McGwire pointed to the crowd and hugged his son Matt, his teammates
and members of the Maris family.

DON'T FORGET: ROGER MARIS COULD PLAY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While everybody is cheering Mark McGwire, let us not overlook
Roger Maris. For 37 years, in life and in death, Maris held one of
sports' most important records, despite the sullen disapproval of
many fans, who saw him as a one-trick imposter.
</P>
<P>
   The incessant buzz of the talk-radio age has turned Babe Ruth
into ``the fat guy who hit home runs,'' which is purely bogus. Ruth
was an agile right fielder for much of his career, with a good arm
and a good baseball brain, and Maris was a worthy successor.
</P>
<P>
   Maris surpassed Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle under intense
pressure, and his 61 home runs in 1961 should have brought him more
fame, more money, more joy, more permanent respect, than they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger played in seven World Series, was a two-time most
valuable player _ and he broke Babe Ruth's record,'' said Ralph
Terry, a former teammate. ``But he got in a feud with a couple of
writers, so he's not in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget just how good a ballplayer he was,'' said
another teammate, Johnny Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   Maris never had a buffed or laboratory look. His muscles came
with the original package that once ran back five kickoffs for
touchdowns in a high school football game. His hands and his eyes
were intimately coordinated at birth, and his compact, powerful,
left-handed uppercut stroke was born to drive a baseball into the
porch in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He was no surprise when he hit 61 homers. Roger Eugene Maris was
born on Sept. 10, 1934, in Hibbing, Minn., and raised in Fargo,
N.D. He arrived in the majors in 1957 with Cleveland. The next year
he was traded to the Kansas City A's, the Yankees' major league
farm team in the docile cartel that was the American League in the
bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved him in Kansas City,'' said Terry, who was exiled
there by the Yankees for a couple of years. ``He could run and drag
a bunt and he was leading the league around .345 when he had an
appendectomy. He came back too soon, and his stomach muscles were
weak and he had a couple of slumps like 2-60 and 5-90 and he
finished at .273.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only way Kansas City could send him to the
Yankees,'' Terry added. ``If he was hitting .345, they would have
torn up the place if Roger was traded.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees failed to win the pennant in 1959 _ an outrage
to all concerned _ management sent Hank Bauer, Don Larsen, Norm
Siebern and a minor league slugger named Marvin Eugene Throneberry
to their Kansas City cousins for two other players and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news on the tube and I went out and bought a new
car,'' said Blanchard, recalling the era of modest salaries, when
buying a car was a big deal for a second-string catcher. ``My wife
asked me if I was crazy, but I had caught against Roger in the
minors and the majors, and I knew he was what we were missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the car in January _ and paid for it in October,''
said Blanchard, now 65 and retired in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Maris arrived in spring training with a crew cut and a lopsided
smirk, his way of deflecting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking him what his goals were for 1960,'' recalls
Jim Ogle, who covered the Yankees for many decades for The Newark
Star-Ledger and is now the loyal organizer of the Yankee alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, who had hit 58 homers in his first three seasons, said he
hoped to hit 25 or 30 home runs, and Ogle asked if Maris was not
setting his goals too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger said, `If I say 25 or 30 and I hit 35 or 40, then I'm
having a good year,''' Ogle recalled. `` `But if I say 35 or 40 and
I only hit 25 or 30, then I'm having a bad year.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was typical Roger Maris. He would tell you exactly what
he was thinking. You may not like it, or agree with him, but he
didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel sent him out to play right field, where Babe Ruth
and Tommy (Old Reliable) Henrich had patrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey was a stickler on always hitting the relay man,''
Blanchard said. ``I don't think in his entire career that Roger
ever threw to the wrong base.''
</P>
<P>
   The new man batted .283 and led the league with 112 runs batted
in and 39 homers and was voted the most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 Yankees are now remembered as one of the great teams of
their era. Mantle and Maris shared a bittersweet laugh at the way
the fans cheered Mantle and rooted for him to break the record.
There were rumors of a feud between the two, who shared an
apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, everybody knew Mickey was the greatest, and it helped
Roger to bat third, ahead of Mickey, but Roger was the one who
broke the record,'' said Terry, 62, a golf professional in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   While Mantle faded slightly, the press continued to flock to the
Stadium. It was nothing like the swollen swarm of reporters and
camera crews today, but still a shock to gruff country boys like
Mantle and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Maris was blunt and even funny. For a while,
he even joked when his hair started turning white, in patches.
</P>
<P>
   Terry recalled pitching in ``the asterisk game,'' the 154th
game, which would have been the last game of the season under the
traditional schedule of a year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing in about 18 miles per hour,'' Terry said
of the game, which was played in Baltimore. ``The first time he hit
a drive to the fence. The second one went out.'' That was No. 59.
</P>
<P>
   Maris tied Ruth in ``asterisk'' overtime and then on Oct. 1,
1961, Maris swatted a fly into the right-field stands for his 61st
homer. For decades, Maris' record for 162 games and Ruth's record
for 154 were both listed in the record book, until Ruth's line was
dropped in the early 1990s by Fay Vincent, the last commissioner
who was not an owner.
</P>
<P>
   The writers voted Maris the most valuable player once again, for
hitting .269 and leading the league with 132 runs scored, 142 runs
batted in and, of course, 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Maris later became alienated from the Yankees, believing
management favored the fragile Mantle and overlooked Maris'
injuries. ``Roger broke his hand in the spring of 1962 catching a
ball Kaline hit off me,'' Terry said, referring to Al Kaline, the
Detroit right fielder. ``He played the whole season, but it never
healed right, and he lost his grip and never had the same power.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris reacted to some hatchet jobs in the press, and stopped
talking to most reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever crossed Roger one time, he'd never speak to you,''
Terry said. ``That was Roger.'' Ultimately, the Yankees shipped
Maris to St. Louis, where he helped win pennants for the Cardinals
in 1967 and 1968, before quietly retiring. He died of cancer in
1985, finally reconciled with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when McGwire and Junior Griffey fell off the Maris
pace, it was easy to picture the old grouch saying, ``Now they know
how tough it was.'' This year is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, the ball is as tight as a golf ball,'' Terry said. ``I
see actors hitting balls out in celebrity games.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard said: ``Roger knew that records are made to be broken.
I can see Roger watching McGwire and Sosa and saying, `Have at
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new man has earned the record, early and decisively. But
let's not forget Roger Maris, who once hit 61 homers in a season _
and never threw to the wrong base.

SCHOOL BOARD ASKS JUDGE TO DISMISS STRIKING TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. _ With a New Jersey judge seemingly poised to
start jailing striking teachers in Middletown Township at the
urging of school officials, the school board abandoned that request
Tuesday and instead asked that teachers lose their jobs if the
walkout persists.
</P>
<P>
   After the board shifted its strategy, Judge Clarkson Fisher Jr.
of State Superior Court recessed a contempt-of-court hearing until
Thursday morning, effectively giving the board and the teachers'
union, the Middletown Township Education Association, more time to
resolve a long and bitter contract dispute that prompted the
teachers to walk out on the first day of school last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher seemed ready Tuesday to begin imposing jail terms to
those who have violated a back-to-work order he issued last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected arguments by the union's lawyer, Sandy Oxfeld, that
his order was improper and that he had no jurisdiction because the
union had filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the state's
Public Employment Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After a recess, the board's lawyer, Douglas Kovats, disavowed
any jail terms. ''In all candor,'' he said, ``I'm not particularly
concerned with putting anybody in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kovats asked the judge to order that teachers would
forfeit their jobs by continuing to defy the back-to-work order
once the judge sets a deadline for a return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   After Oxfeld asked for more time to prepare a response to that
proposal, Fisher ordered the hearing continued on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the hearing, Diane Swaim, president of the
striking union, told about 500 teachers gathered outside Monmouth
County's Hall of Records here that she was prepared to resume
bargaining Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other union officials said that night-long talks that preceded
the court session had narrowed differences on a new contract to
replace one that expired in 1996. &QL;

EXPERT ON BANKING MERGERS AT GOLDMAN, SACHS PLANS TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J. Christopher Flowers, a founder of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co.'s lucrative financial institutions merger practice, said
Tuesday that he was leaving the firm at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers' retirement comes at a sensitive time for Goldman: The
firm reaffirmed Tuesday its intention to end its private
partnership and issue shares to the public in November.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers not only counseled Goldman regarding its offering, but
the group he helped build is also one of its most successful. So
far this year his team served as advisers on $197 billion of
domestic banking mergers, nearly half all announced.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, a 20-year Goldman veteran, not only counseled Norwest
in its planned $34 billion acquisition of Wells Fargo this year,
but he helped defend Mellon Bank when the Bank of New York
announced an unsolicited offer to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers' announcement caught some Goldman bankers by surprise,
executives close to the company say. In an interview in July,
Flowers said then that he was not considering retirement, but
indicated he would be interested in other responsibilities at the
firm. ``I've done so many deals that doing the next deal isn't that
important to me,'' he said at that time.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Flowers hoped to be named one of three chief
operating officers responsible for running the investment-banking
unit on a day-to-day basis, several Goldman executives said. But by
early August it became clear that Flowers would not be picked.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs instead went to Mac Heller, Goldman's global mergers
and acquisitions chief, Robert Kaplan, head of corporate finance
for the Americas, and Peter Weinberg, head of global
telecommunications, media and technology banking. Flowers would
also not be named to Goldman's management committee, one of the two
governing entities to be created after the offering.
</P>
<P>
   It was in light of those two decisions by Goldman management
that Flowers, 40, told the executive committee he would retire. The
decision was disclosed Tuesday in a memo to all employees, after
certain clients and employees were told over the Labor Day holiday,
a person close to Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years is a long time to be at any one place,'' Flowers
said in an interview Tuesday. He did not disclose his plans, but
said he was considering several opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's co-chief executives and chairmen, Jon Corzine and
Henry Paulson Jr., meanwhile, reaffirmed Tuesday their intention to
pursue the public offering in the fall despite the recent
turbulence in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO process is still on track,'' Paulson said in a
broadcast to Goldman employees worldwide, according to people who
watched it. He said that Goldman's decision to go public was
prompted by the need to overhaul the company's ownership structure
and solidify its capital base, a need that was not directly
affected by short-term rises and falls in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine and Paulson also reiterated earlier statements that
trading losses in volatile emerging markets had a relatively small
effect on the firm's bottom line. &QL;

PATAKI SIGNS LAW CREATING PARK ON HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying Manhattan's western waterfront has been an
embarrassment since his days as a young lawyer on Wall Street, Gov.
George Pataki signed a law Tuesday to create a park nearly five
miles long, from Battery Park City to 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``How proud I am,'' Pataki said at a signing ceremony at Pier 25
in TriBeCa that was also attended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, State
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and community advocates on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that the park was ``one of the very best things we
can do during our period of time in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the park, which is expected to cost up to $390
million, is scheduled to begin in October and to be finished in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work is already under way. A bike path is to run the
length of the park, and the part that passes through Greenwich
Village is already under construction. And Pier 40 is also to be
part of the park, and on Sunday, the governor is to dedicate two
soccer fields on the pier's roof.
</P>
<P>
   The law protects the stretch of riverfront as a park, a status
it never had before, said Marcia Reiss, policy director for the
Parks Council, a research and advocacy group. ``It was a plan
before,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The project includes the renovation of 14 piers for public use,
the construction of a 4.5-mile waterfront esplanade and swaths of
green space along the river. It also protects river habitat by
creating a sanctuary under the oversight of state conservation
officials. Many kinds of commercial development _ including hotels,
offices and gambling and cruise ships _ are banned. Pataki received
sustained applause when he promised that the park would include a
beach in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still significant problems facing the park, which
grew out of a failed plan in the 1970s called Westway, a sunken
freeway that would have run along the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers must issue a permit for any
construction done in the river, and plans now call for rebuilding
some rotting piers and replacing a bulkhead at the river's edge
along the length of the park. Three federal agencies and numerous
opponents of the park have testified that those plans could
endanger fish and other wildlife. One possibility is that their
opposition could result in a lengthy environmental impact
statement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, said
in a letter to the Corps of Engineers, ``Based upon our review of
the available information, we cannot conclude that the overall
project will avoid adverse effects on the Hudson River.''
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the project were passing out copies of the letter at the
signing ceremony Tuesday, as they pressed their argument that the
law cedes too much authority to what they fear will become an
uncontrollable new public authority bent on commercial development.
They waved signs saying, ``The Bill's a Trick,'' and ``Park Not
Pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Benstock, who heads the Clean Air Campaign, a longtime foe
of the park, noted that Westway was defeated when it failed to win
approval from the Corps of Engineers, which was worried about the
survival of striped bass. Of New York state's law, she said, ``The
protections are flimsy and riddled with loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   James Haggery, who supervises permits issued by the Corps of
Engineers for the eastern United States, said there is no timetable
for a decision on the permit. He said the agency would pass along
the concerns of the agencies and critics to the new Hudson River
Park Trust for answers before making a decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albert Butzel, chairman of the Hudson River Park Alliance, a
coalition of 35 environmental and civic groups in favor of the
park, said the issues were considerably different from those
presented by Westway, which involved plans for 200 acres of
landfill in the Hudson. The new park involves none. A leading
opponent of the freeway, Butzel also maintained that the governing
structure of the trust would be far more democratic than most state
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The new trust is to manage the park. It will have 13 board
members, five appointed by the governor and five by the mayor. The
remaining three will be appointed by the Manhattan borough
president in consultation with Community Boards 1, 2 and 4, which
abut the park. Only two of the three community representatives will
be allowed to vote at any one time. To make sure that neither the
mayor nor the governor can push through a measure unacceptable to
the other, eight votes are required to make major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The trust is also not allowed to issue bonds or condemn
property. The law stipulates that any commercial use of parkland
must go through normal city zoning procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle for the park is financing. Although the city and
state have each pledged $100 million to build the park, that is
just a little more than half of the estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fox, who has served as president of the Hudson River Park
Conservancy, the agency in charge of park planning until the trust
takes over, suggests a number of fund-raising possibilities. Among
these are surcharges on property taxes paid by nearby owners, on
the theory that the park will increase the value of their real
estate.

   NEW YORK _ What's a nice Mormon girl who grew up in Huntington
Beach, Calif. _ home of shopping centers and surfers _ doing as the
editor of Quest, the Manhattan society magazine that lovingly
chronicles the 10021 set?
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think there is an irony going on with California
surfer culture and Mormon baggage,'' said Kristina Stewart, the
editor in question, addressing the early influences in her life.
``But that irony was set in motion long before I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Stewart did respond to a request for an interview
with a startled, ``But I'm just a dork from California!''
</P>
<P>
   She is a 31-year-old disarming and nervous workaholic who has
been reading French Vogue since she was 16. So here she is in the
big city, at the dawn of the fall social season, having a very good
time.
</P>
<P>
   There was a party Tuesday night for Bill Blass. There is a party
Wednesday night at Saks for British designers. Thursday there's a
New York City Opera dinner-dance, a Dolce &AMP; Gabbana perfume party,
a Moschino store opening and an art-meets-fashion event at
Bendel's. ``It's a four-fer,'' said Ms. Stewart, who plans to go to
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, which now matters in certain pockets of the Upper
East Side, New York society is ``a fascinating sandbox'' with ``its
own vocabulary'' but is still welcoming of new languages. ``If it
wasn't,'' Ms. Stewart said, ``it would be like Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart talked for a couple of hours the other day in her
downtown office at Meigher Communications, which owns Quest and its
well-dressed sisters, Garden Design and Saveur.
</P>
<P>
   Quest, a 10-year-old monthly, prints 85,000 copies and
distributes the bulk of them free to apartment buildings in the
epicenter of its universe: Fifth and Park Avenues from 60th to 90th
Streets. It also goes free to the Knickerbocker Club, the Harvard
Club and so on. It is sold on newsstands, and some people actually
pay for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart is just completing her first year as editor, with a
mission to feature hatching socialites. The magazine has no teeth _
Chris Meigher, the chairman of Meigher Communications, describes it
as ``a celebration of New York'' _ but it has generated buzz among
the pretty young things it pays attention to. People like to look
at Quest's real estate ads, the bedrock of its advertising, and the
party pictures.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Ms. Stewart put the young socialite and designer
Alexandra Lind on the cover, posing her at East Hampton's Maidstone
Club, which caused the club to throw a fit because it said Ms. Lind
was using the institution to promote her clothes. Shocking! In
March Ms. Stewart reached into the safer stratosphere when she put
Brooke Astor on the cover of an issue featuring the 400 New York
socialites Ms. Stewart considered the ``Quest 400,'' which people
on the list read avidly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who is the most interesting person Ms. Stewart left off the
list?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmmm,'' she said. ``Who can I afford to alienate?'' She
thought for a moment. ``Ivana Trump,'' she finally said, ``did not
find herself here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she illustrates the best of what society is
about,'' Ms. Stewart said, a tad haughtily. ``There is a
graciousness and a sense of responsibility that comes with having a
high-profile position in society.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Donald Trump is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart seemed ready for that. ``He has an interesting
profession and a position in the New York community you can't
ignore,'' she said. And, she pointed out, ``everyone has redeeming
qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart, who likes to dance, ice-skate and wear Lilly
Pulitzer and Pucci, described herself as ``definitely a
card-carrying Mormon'' who does not believe in drinking, smoking or
premarital sex. Her religion, she said, ``means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she never touches alcohol on the social circuit, and
that it keeps her vision clear. She agrees, especially when it came
to running around to the clubs with friends when she first came to
New York a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gave me a little perspective,'' Ms. Stewart said, ``to
be in the environment but not totally of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was happy to get out of Huntington Beach. ``I think there
was a weather-induced lethargy that hung over the area,'' Ms.
Stewart said. ``I was at odds with the collective psyche.'' She
went to Brigham Young University, her mother's choice, but spent
two summers working at British Vogue, first under Anna Wintour,
then Liz Tilberis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I negotiated this pact with my mom that I would go to BYU if I
could do fun things in the summer,'' Ms. Stewart said. (Ms.
Stewart's mother, a former city planner, now works in private land
development. Her stepfather is the former city manager of Baldwin
Park in Los Angeles County. Her father, a banker, died 12 years
ago.) After college, Ms. Stewart wrote freelance articles, then
spent three summers editing the exceptionally glossy Hamptons
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knows well the ``ugly aspects'' of society _ ``I'm
aware of bigotry, and that there are women of dependent means and
that there are meal tickets waiting to find them'' _ but won't
dwell on them in Quest. One reason she likes covering the young
rich of the Upper East Side, she said, is because the community is
``conservative and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart adores old society photographs, especially one of
the socialite C.Z. Guest taken by Slim Aarons at a pool in Palm
Beach in the 1950s. It's hanging behind her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better than that,'' Ms. Stewart said.

<P>
   While everybody is cheering Mark McGwire, let us not overlook
Roger Maris. For 37 years, in life and in death, Maris held one of
sports' most important records, despite the sullen disapproval of
many fans, who saw him as a one-trick imposter.
</P>
<P>
   The incessant buzz of the talk-radio age has turned Babe Ruth
into ``the fat guy who hit home runs,'' which is purely bogus. Ruth
was an agile right fielder for much of his career, with a good arm
and a good baseball brain, and Maris was a worthy successor.
</P>
<P>
   Maris surpassed Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle under intense
pressure, and his 61 home runs in 1961 should have brought him more
fame, more money, more joy, more permanent respect, than they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger played in seven World Series, was a two-time most
valuable player _ and he broke Babe Ruth's record,'' said Ralph
Terry, a former teammate. ``But he got in a feud with a couple of
writers, so he's not in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget just how good a ballplayer he was,'' said
another teammate, Johnny Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   Maris never had a buffed or laboratory look. His muscles came
with the original package that once ran back five kickoffs for
touchdowns in a high school football game. His hands and his eyes
were intimately coordinated at birth, and his compact, powerful,
left-handed uppercut stroke was born to drive a baseball into the
porch in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He was no surprise when he hit 61 homers. Roger Eugene Maris was
born on Sept. 10, 1934, in Hibbing, Minn., and raised in Fargo,
N.D. He arrived in the majors in 1957 with Cleveland. The next year
he was traded to the Kansas City A's, the Yankees' major league
farm team in the docile cartel that was the American League in the
bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved him in Kansas City,'' said Terry, who was exiled
there by the Yankees for a couple of years. ``He could run and drag
a bunt and he was leading the league around .345 when he had an
appendectomy. He came back too soon, and his stomach muscles were
weak and he had a couple of slumps like 2-60 and 5-90 and he
finished at .273.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only way Kansas City could send him to the
Yankees,'' Terry added. ``If he was hitting .345, they would have
torn up the place if Roger was traded.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees failed to win the pennant in 1959 _ an outrage
to all concerned _ management sent Hank Bauer, Don Larsen, Norm
Siebern and a minor league slugger named Marvin Eugene Throneberry
to their Kansas City cousins for two other players and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news on the tube and I went out and bought a new
car,'' said Blanchard, recalling the era of modest salaries, when
buying a car was a big deal for a second-string catcher. ``My wife
asked me if I was crazy, but I had caught against Roger in the
minors and the majors, and I knew he was what we were missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the car in January _ and paid for it in October,''
said Blanchard, now 65 and retired in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Maris arrived in spring training with a crew cut and a lopsided
smirk, his way of deflecting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking him what his goals were for 1960,'' recalls
Jim Ogle, who covered the Yankees for many decades for The Newark
Star-Ledger and is now the loyal organizer of the Yankee alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, who had hit 58 homers in his first three seasons, said he
hoped to hit 25 or 30 home runs, and Ogle asked if Maris was not
setting his goals too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger said, `If I say 25 or 30 and I hit 35 or 40, then I'm
having a good year,''' Ogle recalled. `` `But if I say 35 or 40 and
I only hit 25 or 30, then I'm having a bad year.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was typical Roger Maris. He would tell you exactly what
he was thinking. You may not like it, or agree with him, but he
didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel sent him out to play right field, where Babe Ruth
and Tommy (Old Reliable) Henrich had patrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey was a stickler on always hitting the relay man,''
Blanchard said. ``I don't think in his entire career that Roger
ever threw to the wrong base.''
</P>
<P>
   The new man batted .283 and led the league with 112 runs batted
in and 39 homers and was voted the most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 Yankees are now remembered as one of the great teams of
their era. Mantle and Maris shared a bittersweet laugh at the way
the fans cheered Mantle and rooted for him to break the record.
There were rumors of a feud between the two, who shared an
apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, everybody knew Mickey was the greatest, and it helped
Roger to bat third, ahead of Mickey, but Roger was the one who
broke the record,'' said Terry, 62, a golf professional in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   While Mantle faded slightly, the press continued to flock to the
Stadium. It was nothing like the swollen swarm of reporters and
camera crews today, but still a shock to gruff country boys like
Mantle and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Maris was blunt and even funny. For a while,
he even joked when his hair started turning white, in patches.
</P>
<P>
   Terry recalled pitching in ``the asterisk game,'' the 154th
game, which would have been the last game of the season under the
traditional schedule of a year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing in about 18 miles per hour,'' Terry said
of the game, which was played in Baltimore. ``The first time he hit
a drive to the fence. The second one went out.'' That was No. 59.
</P>
<P>
   Maris tied Ruth in ``asterisk'' overtime and then on Oct. 1,
1961, Maris swatted a fly into the right-field stands for his 61st
homer. For decades, Maris' record for 162 games and Ruth's record
for 154 were both listed in the record book, until Ruth's line was
dropped in the early 1990s by Fay Vincent, the last commissioner
who was not an owner.
</P>
<P>
   The writers voted Maris the most valuable player once again, for
hitting .269 and leading the league with 132 runs scored, 142 runs
batted in and, of course, 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Maris later became alienated from the Yankees, believing
management favored the fragile Mantle and overlooked Maris'
injuries. ``Roger broke his hand in the spring of 1962 catching a
ball Kaline hit off me,'' Terry said, referring to Al Kaline, the
Detroit right fielder. ``He played the whole season, but it never
healed right, and he lost his grip and never had the same power.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris reacted to some hatchet jobs in the press, and stopped
talking to most reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever crossed Roger one time, he'd never speak to you,''
Terry said. ``That was Roger.'' Ultimately, the Yankees shipped
Maris to St. Louis, where he helped win pennants for the Cardinals
in 1967 and 1968, before quietly retiring. He died of cancer in
1985, finally reconciled with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when McGwire and Junior Griffey fell off the Maris
pace, it was easy to picture the old grouch saying, ``Now they know
how tough it was.'' This year is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, the ball is as tight as a golf ball,'' Terry said. ``I
see actors hitting balls out in celebrity games.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard said: ``Roger knew that records are made to be broken.
I can see Roger watching McGwire and Sosa and saying, `Have at
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new man has earned the record, early and decisively. But
let's not forget Roger Maris, who once hit 61 homers in a season _
and never threw to the wrong base.
