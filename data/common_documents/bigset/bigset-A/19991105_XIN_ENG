<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official to Visit Lebanon, Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is to visit Lebanon Friday
over Lebanon's death penalty recently given to a prominent
Palestinian political figure, the Foreign Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Farouq Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, will
hold talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who is also
foreign minister, over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi is in Syria, the main power-broker of Lebanon, for
talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa on the issue. The
results of the meeting were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Lebanese military court sentenced Sultan
Abul-Ainayn, Arafat's top representative in Lebanon, to death in
absentia on charges of forming and heading an armed gang against
the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is the PLO's secretary general in Lebanon and also
heads the Lebanon branch of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
mainstream faction Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn decried the ruling, saying "it is not a judicial
verdict but with political motives that target the entire
Palestinian people and their cause."
</P>
<P>
He refused to turn himself in to Lebanese authorities and is
still living in the heavily-armed Rashidieh Palestinian camp near
Lebanon's southern port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Beirut press said the surprise move against Abul-Ainayn might
have been motivated by the recent re-emergence of Fatah at the Ein
El-Hilweh camp near the southern port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The camp is the biggest among the 12 shantytowns that house an
estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees, who fled the Palestinian
territories after the establishment of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ein El-Hilweh camp was dominated by the rival
Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, which are opposed to Arafat's
peace process with Israel.

<P>
ATHENS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
pay an official two-day visit to Greece from November 13 to 14,
Greece announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Clinton will meet Greek leaders, including
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, to discuss bilateral relations,
Greek-Turkish ties, the Cyprus problem and the issue of combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for Clinton's visit, an advance team of U.S. law
enforcement officials has arrived in Athens with hi-tech security
equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece's political parties and trade unions have
decided to demonstrate outside the U.S. embassy in Athens to
protest against Washington's Balkan policy during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, six cars were damaged in a fire that broke
out when a home-made bomb exploded in an automobile dealership in
the Athens residential district of Ambelokipi.
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself "Anti-State Action" claimed
responsibility for the bomb attack, saying that the action was in
protest of Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Greece has taken unprecedented security measures for Clinton
with over 10,000 policemen being assigned to the Athens airport.

<HEADLINE> Christian Leaders in Israel Threaten to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Christian leaders in the Holy
land threatened Thursday to close their churches for two days to
protest against a plan to build a mosque near a Christian shrine
in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
"All Sanctuaries of the Holy land will be closed on 22 and 23
November 1999 to express disapproval of the plan for a mosque near
Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation," the Christian leaders
said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that we do not need to take any further steps in the
future," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Clearly aiming at a global audience, the statement, which was
signed by the patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox, Latin and Armenian
Churches, was addressed to all ambassadors, local Christians,
Christian pilgrims and travel agents in all Israel.
</P>
<P>
If the churches be closed, the consequences will not only effect
Israel's hopes for a millennium tourism boom, but will also cast
clouds for the prospects of a historical visit to the Holy land by
Pope John Paul II next March.
</P>
<P>
Israel expects three million foreign visitors to come to Israel
next year as the holy land marks the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The mosque issue has been dragged on for a long time in
Nazareth, a holy city in northern Israel. A government committee
gave permit to the Muslims in the city to build a mosque on land
just meters from the Basilica, which Christians in the city said
that was the place where the Virgin Mary was told she would bear
the Son of God.
</P>
<P>
Vatican has asked the Israeli government to rethink about the
mosque issue, indicating that if the mosque was built at that
place, Pope John Paul II will not come to the Holy land for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims in the city said that the place belong to them and
they have the right to build the mosque in which they could pray.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Global Campaign to Counter Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Thursday launched an unprecedented global campaign to
counter tobacco industry deception around the world.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called "Tobacco Kills, Don't Be Duped", brings
together senior health and media activists from 20 countries to
join forces with the existing successful anti-smoking program to
expose big tobacco's worldwide campaign of deception and lies,
said WHO in a press release here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Every sleeping and waking hour from billboards, television
screens, movies, radios and now the Internet, the tobacco industry
beckons our children with messages that, whichever way you
interpret them, say `give us this day your daily breath'," said Dr
Derek Yach, Head of WHO Tobacco Free Initiative.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has called
tobacco a communicated disease, communicated through advertising.
</P>
<P>
The "Don't Be Duped" campaign will strengthen the ability of
broadcast and newspaper journalists and other health communicators
worldwide to sift facts from fiction about tobacco use, its spread
and promotion.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco kills 11,000 people a day worldwide, according to WHO.
By 2020, it will kill 10 million people a year, 70 percent of them
in the developing world. Developing countries are now the target
of the tobacco industry's expanding assault on global public
health.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should be trying to help other countries,"
said Helen Brown of the American Cancer Society, which supported
the campaign launch. "Unfortunately, US tobacco companies are
picking on developing countries to aggressively market their
products, products they know will cause death and disease."
</P>
<P>
"The Marlboro man is gone from here but he's running amok in
other lands. Together we have to ensure that he has nowhere to
run, nowhere to hide," said Yach at a special session in
California.
</P>
<P>
WHO has begun work on the Framework Convention on tobacco
Control, the world's first public health treaty. Last week over
100 countries representing 93 percent of the world's population
met in Geneva and called for strong global action against tobacco
to complement national legislation.

LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Thursday urged Russia
to stop its military action on the Chechen capital of Grozny and
seek a political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a letter to his Russian
counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and asked Russian troops to halt
advance on Grozny, Blair's spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Blair's second about Chechnya in a month, the
British prime minister expressed his concern about civilian
casualties and called on Russia to give free access to
humanitarian relief organizations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But Blair did not see the situation as comparable to Kosovo, in
which Britain sent troops to help the human refugees in the
southern Serbian province, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Blair would not necessarily compare the situation
in Chechnya with that of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Putin he understood Russian fears and the threat of
terror, but he believed "a lasting solution can only be achieved
through the political process", the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Germany: Europe Concerned by U.S. Signal of Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said on Thursday that Europe was fearful
that the U.S. Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty
could signal a change in the U.S. strategy.
</P>
<P>
Such a signal would make the European countries "very unhappy,"
Fischer told reporters before meeting U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban
treaty, Fischer said the move sends a bad message to other nuclear
states.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is not reflecting a shift in the basic strategy
of the United States," Fischer said, adding it would be "very
serious."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that non-nuclear states are looking to the United
States to provide "some sort of order" in a nuclear world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate rejected the nuclear test ban treaty by a vote
of 51-48, ignoring appeals from the Clinton administration and
governments from other countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton blasted the Republicans who control the
Senate as "new isolationists."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Balkans, Fischer called for consideration of a
lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia. Such a measure could be a
support for the opposition in that country.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer added that he is against lifting the sanctions if
this will help Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, adding that
peace can only come when his policy of trying to establish a
greater Serbia is rejected.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Do His Best on China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vowed on Wednesday that he will do his utmost to reach an
agreement with China on its access to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and if that is done he will try to push the Congress into
offering Beijing a permanent normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is in the long-term interests of our people,"
Clinton told a group of correspondents at a press conference at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
He said that the entry into WTO will also benefit "an open
China that is a responsible partner in a world in which China will
be at some point in the 21st century, if it keeps growing, the
biggest economy in the world, that they be part of the rule-based
system of global trading and investment".
</P>
<P>
"So I hope that we can work it out, and I'll do my best,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I do want to say that if we could work it out, I am completely
committed to trying to get passed in the Congress a permanent
normal trading status for China. And I do believe that we can
prevail now," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that both parties in the United States have come
to see the issue as "important for our nation's long-term security
and economic well-being."
</P>
<P>
"I will do what I can to achieve it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States failed to reach an agreement with China on
the WTO issue when Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visited Washington
this Spring. The debacle has ignited wide-spread criticizism from
U.S. business as well as other communities outcrying for improved
trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
China suspended talks on WTO in May after the U.S.-led NATO
forces bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The two sides
agreed to resume negotiations at the Auckland Summit between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in
September.

<HEADLINE> ECB Rate Hike May Slow Italian Economy Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank's (ECB)
decision on rising its key rate 0.50 percent from 2.5 percent to
3.0 percent on Thursday will make Italian bank loans and mortgages
dearer and may also slow the pace of the Italian economy's
recovery, some economic analysts said here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the rise in loan and mortgage rates may not be as
sharp as on other occasions, since the Italian banking market has
already moved in anticipation of the ECB move, they said to
Italian news agency Ansa.
</P>
<P>
Installment payments on cars or electrical appliances will also
become dearer as a consequence of the central bank's move.
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, Italian banks are expected to raise the
interest they pay on current accounts and deposits.
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, banks have been much quicker to factor
central bank hikes into their loan rates than their deposit rates.
</P>
<P>
Another consequence of the rate move could be seen in the
upcoming auctions of state paper, even though the market has
already priced the hike into its dealings, pushing yields up to
their level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
As for the Italy's heaviest public debt, a one-point rate
increase has been calculated in the past as pushing up
debt-servicing costs by about 20 trillion lire (about 11.4 billion
U.S. dollars) over three years - so this half-point hike might be
expected to cost Italy 10 trillion (5.7 billion U.S. dollars) in
that period.
</P>
<P>
But analysts also said the exact effect is hard to predict
because of the way markets have anticipated the move.

<HEADLINE> Belgian General Named Commander of U.N. Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has appointed a high-ranking Belgian military officer
as Force Commander of the United Nations Mission for Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO), U.N. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of consultations, Annan informed the U.N.
Security Council of his intention to appoint Brigadier-General
Claude Buze of Belgium as MINURSO's Force Commander and Council
members agreed with Annan's choice, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Buze's appointment took effect as of November 1. In his post
as the force commander, he has replaced Major-General Bernd
Lubenik of Austria, whose term of duty came to and end on October
31.
</P>
<P>
MINURSO was set up in 1991 in accordance with a settlement
proposal aimed at resolving an ongoing dispute over Western
Sahara, a territory on the northwest coast of Africa, involving
Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Sagui el-Hamra
and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was accepted by both parties, provided for
a ceasefire and a referendum to choose between independence and
integration with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
According to its mandate, MINURSO was entrusted to perform a
wise range of tasks, from monitoring the ceasefire and verifying
th reduction of Moroccan troops in Western Sahara to identifying
and registering qualified voters, and organizing and ensuring a
free and fair referendum.

<HEADLINE> Bird's Eye View of UK Captured for Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A bird's eye view of Britain on
the threshold of the new millennium has been captured on film so
that every town, street, field and cowshed can be found on a giant
Internet map.
</P>
<P>
The snapshot of Britain frozen in time was created by the
Millennium Map Company which sent four planes up to photograph the
first complete aerial survey of the country, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
The first shots of England -- paying customers can zoom in on
their neighbourhood -- will be available on the information
superhighway in January with Scotland and Wales following suit by
the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The company is taking 75,000 photos for its 5 million-pound (8
million U.S. dollars) project dedicated to Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
The firm plans to retake the same photos every five years,
supplying a time machine trip that could help everyone from town
planners to environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
He said the Millennium Map ranked in importance alongside
William the Conqueror's Domesday Book of 1086 which catalogued the
nation in such detail from landholdings to livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 flying hours were needed to capture England with this
unique footprint in time. The planes covered a distance equivalent
to flying one and a half times around the world.
</P>
<P>
The problem for the pilots was that Britain only has about nine
cloud-free days a year over the entire country.
</P>
<P>
They had to battle against cloud, haze and rain with August and
much of September virtually written off.
</P>
<P>
And when the project is finished, anyone with the stamina to
embark on a frame-by-frame trawl across the country would need 12
years to look at every shot on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Offer More Opportunities for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Thursday his government is considering a
recommendation for a quota system which will enable women to
occupy positions of power in public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government is aware that women who constitute 52 percent
of the adult population are under-represented in public service,
especially at middle and top management levels, Mugabe told the
women attending a seminar on "women in power" in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"A quota system has long been mooted to ensure that women have
equal representation on public boards and commissions," the
president said, adding that "the government is actively looking
into this recommendation."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front)
had already endorsed the recommendation, though this has been
difficult to implement.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted that women frustrate each other and need to unite
and work towards equitable representation in leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
There is need for women's organizations and political parties
to encourage them to participate in public affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
But for women to confidently hold public positions, they need
to attain high levels of educational qualifications, the president
stressed.
</P>
<P>
High levels of education would empower women economically and
help challenge misconceptions that women were not capable of
holding positions in public service, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Women, especially those in rural areas, have difficulty in
sourcing for funds and owning property as they are treated as
second-class citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to take progressive steps in
addressing issues related to the emancipation of women, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, attended by some 140 women from various
organizations, was designed to identify common barriers that women
face in seeking for equal opportunities.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Set up Efficient Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo has urged the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) members to establish an efficient legal system as the
regional organization prepares to achieve a free trade area by
October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping has a responsibility to ensure that the
legal and institutional structure of the COMESA addresses the
integration agenda in all its complexity, Tembo said when
officially opening the 4th Meeting of COMESA Ministers of Justice
and Attorneys-General in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A higher level of integration also entails a more efficient
legal and institutional structure to manage, the vice-president
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the COMESA countries should continue educating
the public on the potential benefits of integration so that they
could support the process.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president further stressed the need for increasing
interdependence among COMESA members so as to create large and
viable markets that could compete on the world scale.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha
called for the harmonization of trade and investment laws in the
21-member organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the harmonization of such laws is necessary for the
realization of the establishment of a common investment area for
the region.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also stressed the need to address the issue of fair
competition to achieve a free flow of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> ECB Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua)--The European Central Bank (ECB) in
Frankfurt Thursday afternoon announced to raise its three major
interest rates by 0.5 percentage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after its governing council meeting, the
ECB said its interest rate on the main refinancing operations of
the Eurosystem would be raised to 3%, effective on 10 November..
</P>
<P>
And the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be
raised to 4%, effective on 5 November, while the interest rate on
the deposit facility will be raised to 2%, the ECB said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the ECB rose its key rates in barely
one year after the single European currency had been launched.The
European monetary institution cut the key rates by 0.25 percentage
on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, the President of the ECB, said the
consideration underlying the rate was the projection that the
consumer price in eurolands would rise and bring a pressure of
inflation in following months.
</P>
<P>
"The current economic environment is far more favorable.
Moreover, several indicators, including monetary growth, suggest
that there is ample liquidity in the euro area. Inflation rates
are expected to increase gradually in the months ahead, mainly as
a result of the increase in energy prices earlier this year
working its way through to consumer prices," Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Duisenberg said this decision
would also "help avoiding the sense of insecurity in the market
over ECB's monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
The rate increase is "timely" and will not exert negative
effects on the growth of 11 economies in eurozone, Duisenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision will counter the upward trend of the balance
of risks to price stability. This decision will therefore
contribute to sustaining non-inflationary economic growth in the
euro over the medium term," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"A timely rise in interest rates will avoid the need for a
larger increase in interest rates later and, hence, will
contribute to stronger growth over an extended period of time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg projected "an ongoing strengthening" of the economy
in the eurozone, quoting that recent data releases for the
eurozone suggest an acceleration of real GDP growth rates in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for a continued improvement in output growth
remain good." Duisenberg said.

<HEADLINE> BOE Raises Rates to Head Off Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua)- - The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) Thursday increased UK interest rates by
0.25 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which was widely expected by financial markets,
came shortly ahead of a decision by the European Central Bank
which raised interest rates by 0.5 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The MPC's decision is its second upward move since the UK rate
cycle turned in September when it also added a quarter point to
its benchmark discount rate.
</P>
<P>
The Committee, which has now changed rates 14 times in 30
monthly meetings since it was set up in 1997, made no statement
about the reasons for its decision.
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, government figures have shown a strong
economic recovery in the three months to September, with an
annualized growth rate of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Markets reacted calmly to the decision. The FTSE 100 share
index extended early moderate gains to be 36 points up at 6316.8
points after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the increase boosted confidence in the
performance of the MPC and the strength of the UK's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The move will also pave the way for further increases next year
to curb rising inflationary pressures, they added.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa announced
Thursday a number of new tourism development projects to ensure
sustained economic development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
These projects include an international wetland park, a new
world-class performing arts venue at Kowloon, a cable car system
on Lantau Island linking Tung Chung to the Big Buddha and a 500
million HK dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) "Adventure Bay"
attraction at Ocean Park.
</P>
<P>
"To develop Hong Kong as a world-class city, to sustain
economic development and to create wealth and employment
opportunities, we must strengthen the pillars of our economy,
expand our competitive edge, and develop knowledge-based
businesses," Tung told a luncheon meeting of the Newspaper Society
of Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen this economic pillar, we continue to take
different measures to enhance our competitive edge, including
enhancing coordination, reviewing tourism development strategy and
infrastructure development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The projects under consideration also include the development
of a Fishermen's Wharf in Aberdeen, new waterfront promenades on
both sides of the harbor and improvements to tourist attractions
in Central and Western, especially preservation of characteristic
monuments.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourist Association forecasts that total tourists
will exceed 10 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are naturally delighted with the rise in tourist arrivals.
However, there is still considerable room for development," Tung
said.

KATHMANDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- India made a formal proposal
for postponing the 11th SAARC (South Asia Association for Regional
Cooperation) Summit slated for November 26-28.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of the Indian Foreign Ministry, the
government of India has informed the SAARC chairperson and Nepal,
host country for the summit, that it would be appropriate to defer
the summit for the time being in the interest of the SAARC.
</P>
<P>
This is because the military coup in Pakistan has caused
concern and disquiet in the region and beyond, said the statement
issued here Thursday by the Indian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani civilian government led by Nawaz Sharif was
ousted by the military in a bloodless coup on October 11. India
has been expressing reluctance to deal with the Pakistani military
leader.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in 1985 to promote economic and social
cooperation among its member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

the 2000 Sydney Games for the Olympics finalists, who were a
combination of middle-aged veterans and inexperienced younger
players.
</P>
<P>
"The target for a medal is not a low-pitched words," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that the national team for the continental event
has nothing to compare with the team of three years ago, as China
only concluded six veterans from overseas leagues.
</P>
<P>
"The squad in Atlanta Games was on its peak in that age group.
But now, most of the capped players are struggling to find their
forms while the younger ones are learning."
</P>
<P>
The 1996 national squad averaged 27 years old, and most of the
players of that runners-up team had retired or went abroad.
</P>
<P>
"But our young players are improving. They are dynamic and full
of hopes on the fields of the Olympics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
With eight teams having qualified for the 2000 Olympics, China
is bracketed along with the United States, Australia and Japan as
the favorite medal finishers, with the others, like Canada, Cuba,
Italy and New Zealand, just on-runners.
</P>
<P>
"The Sydney Olympics will be the toughest competition for China,
" said the Chinese head coach Liu Yaming. "We can not just sleep
on the previous glories."
</P>
<P>
Liu tagged Olympic champion the United States and Australia as
the first-classed contenders for the title, while Japan and China
are ranked in the second echelon.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will be the best team in Sydney, and
Australia have made great improvements in recent years. The bronze
medal is what we are setting eyes on," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> EU Condemns Ongoing Violence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Thursday condemned the recent acts of violence against the Serb
population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a Finnish presidential statement released here today, the EU
condemns in particular the incident on 27 October in Pec where a
convoy of 155 Serbs was attacked and several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The EU also condemned the shooting against the President of the
"Kosovo Serbian Resistance Movement" and co-chairman of the
Serbian National Council, Momcilo Trajkovic on 31 October in his
home in Pristina, as well as the many other attacks against
minorities and recent acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The shooting in Pristina is to further complicate efforts to
bring about political dialogue between Serb and ethnic Albanian
political leaders in Kosovo, it added.
</P>
<P>
The EU expects full compliance from all parties with the U.N.
Security Council Resolutions and full cooperation with U.N.
interim administration in Kosovo and the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is committed to a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo.
All Kosovars must be able to stay in and return to Kosovo, and
live there in peace without harassment or intimidation of any kind.
This was, is and will be the basis for the EU's strong commitment
in Kosovo, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday began a closed-door session to consider the
latest report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who asked the
15-member Council to authorize military observers for the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
While noting the economic difficulties facing any United
Nations operation in Congo (K), Annan, in his Tuesday report to
the Security Council, asked the Council to authorize the
deployment of U.N. military observers to the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
The experience gained so far in the preliminary deployment of a
small number of liaison officers in and around the country "has
only served to deepen our appreciation of the difficulties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to support the peace process must continue, he
said, adding that the suffering in Congo (K) has persisted for far
too long to miss the chance offered by the Lusaka Ceasefire
Agreement, which was signed on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan recommended that the Security Council extend
the mandate of the U.N. personnel currently serving in the
Democratic Republic of Congo until January 15. By then, he said,
based on the conclusions of a technical survey team, it should be
possible to provide the Council with further details of the
possible establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping operation in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan also asked the Council for prior authorisation to set up
a U.N. Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(MONUC) and the deployment of up to 500 military observers.
</P>
<P>
The operation would absorb the existing initial deployment and
would be led by a soon to be appointed Special Representative,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of military observers would constitute the
second phase of U.N. involvement in the country. A third phase
would be the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping operation to
assist the parties implement the Lusaka ceasefire agreement and
strengthen the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Congo (K) was backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola, while rebels were supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian service ace Mark
Philippoussis ousted Briton Tim Henman to reach the quarter-finals
of the 2.5-million-U.S.-dollar Paris Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, last year's quarter-final loser to Pete Sampras,
stroke 14 aces to advance 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
Henman, world number 10, was the fourth seed bouncing out of

</P>
<P>
After breezing past the first set, the Australian stormed to a

Henman's confidence waved after taking the second set when
Philippoussis moved smoothly into a 5-2 lead in the decisive set.

<HEADLINE> Official Death Toll in Cyclone-Hit Orissa Put at 904 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Six days after the super
cyclone hit the eastern state of Orissa, the state government
Thursday said 904 people were killed and 104 others still missing
while 9 million more were yet to get any relief in the 10 coastal
districts.
</P>
<P>
However, initial reports from doctors in the cyclone-devastated
area reaching here on the same day put the death toll at 960.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Bhubaneswar, 1,745
kilometers southeast of here, that 7.5 million people remained
marooned with most of their houses ravaged by the killer storm or
flood water.
</P>
<P>
Jagatsinghpur district, which had reported no casualties till
Wednesday, led the list with 373 deaths followed by Puri with 225,
Kendrapara 121 and Cuttack 115, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted D. N. Padhi, special relief commissioner of
the state, as saying that despite valiant efforts by air force
personnel who had been dropping food packets from early morning
till late evening and distributing relief material on land routes,
about 50 percent of the affected people, or 9 million, could not
yet be reached.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member inter-ministerial central team, which arrived
at the area on Wednesday and had made two aerial surveys of the
affected districts, were convinced about the devastation and
assured that the center government would provide necessary
assistance, said Padhi.
</P>
<P>
While reports about damage and destruction of houses from most
of the districts were yet to be received, PTI said, 250,000 houses
had been devastated in Jagatsinghpur district alone.
</P>
<P>
Standing paddy crops over an area of 313,713 hectares were
affected while non-paddy crops in 8,668 hectares had been damaged,
Padhi said.
</P>
<P>
While government officials here maintained there were no
"reports of epidemics or deaths due to epidemics" so far, PTI said
sporadic cases of diarrhea had been reported in the state.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian experts ruled out mass inoculation with typhoid
or cholera vaccine which would be ineffective at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry organized an international experts
committee meeting here Thursday, which was attended by Indian
medical research institutions and organizations of the United
Nations including the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the
Population Fund and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has appealed to international agencies and
non-governmental organizations to coordinate relief and
rehabilitation efforts with health authorities in the state and
the center and to pool in their resources including manpower and
relief material.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Armed Forces launched operations Thursday on a
war-footing to prevent the outbreak of epidemic in the cyclone-hit
area amidst reports of an alarming increase in the number of
patients in different hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Several countries and the U.N. organizations have announced
assistance of some 5 million U.S. dollars to support relief and
humanitarian activities in Orissa.
</P>
<P>
The United States provided 2.35 million dollars including a
financial authorization of 1.08 million rupees (25,200 dollars) by
U.S. Ambassador Richard Celeste to the prime minister's relief
fund.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations rushed 120 metric tons of relief material to
the cyclone-hit area through the UNICEF and 50 tons of high
protein biscuits through the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF is sending 100,000 packets of medical relief like
intravenous (IV) fluids, oral rehydration salts, anti-diarrhea and
chlorine tablets, while a stand-by contingency of 100 doctors is
ready to fly to the state when needed.
</P>
<P>
Indian health authorities Thursday rushed 1 million doses of
measles vaccine and 1.62 million disposable syringes for measles
vaccination to the affected area.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Germany had donated 23 million rupees (536,000
dollars) each while the Canadian International Development Agency
decided to give 4.35 million rupees (100,000 dollars) to the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided Wednesday that
all BJP ministers at the center and states and members of
parliament and state assemblies donate one month's salary toward
the relief fund for victims of the super cyclone.

<HEADLINE> Royal Barge Procession Marks Thai King's Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A colorful royal barge
procession was held Thursday to mark the 72nd, or sixth cycle,
birthday of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest
serving monarch.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 elaborately decorated royal barges propelled by more
than 2,000 oarsmen consisted of the grand barge fleet which
stretched for 1.1 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's procession marked the beginning of a month-long
celebrations of the king's birthday on December 5.
</P>
<P>
The king boarded a 46-meter-long, three-meter-wide barge, which
was built in 1911.
</P>
<P>
Escorted by other barges, the so-called Royal Suphannahongse
Barge carried the king to Wat Arun, one of Bangkok's most
prestigious temple, where the king presented new robes to monks to
mark the end of their annual rainy season prayer retreat.
</P>
<P>
Royal barge processions have been a Thai tradition since the
Ayutthaya period from the 14th to 18th centuries. The last such
procession was held in 1996 to mark the 50th anniversary of the
king's accession to the throne.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Asked to Ratify Mine Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The International
Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions
Thursday appealed to South African President Thabo Mbeki to ensure
that his country ratify a key mining safety standard.
</P>
<P>
The federation, which claims a 20-million-strong membership, is
holding its world congress in South African port city Durban.
</P>
<P>
President of the federation, Hans Berger, asked Mbeki to help
ensure that South Africa ratify Convention 176 of the
International Labor Organization, which set out international
standards for ensuring health and safety in mines and has already
been ratified by 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
Ratification by South Africa, one of the world's biggest mining
nations, would send an important signal to mining countries
worldwide, according to the International Federation of Chemical,
Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has noted the federation's concerns, and he would raise
the matter with South African Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana,
said presidential aide Tasneem Carrim.

<P>
LUANDA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have
controlled over 13 of the 16 cities and towns in northern Uige
Province, the Headquarters of the General Staff of the Armed
Forces of Angola confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The general staff said in a statement that the government
troops have conquered the Town of Macocola in east Uige Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) suffered heavy casualties and lost "numberless"
military materials during the battles near the town, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Macocola was taken over by UNITA rebels in late 1998 when the
civil war renewed in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
After a 38-day all-out offensive in the central plateau -
traditional bastions of the UNITA, the Angolan government troops
gained an advantage over the rebels, driving the rebels into
forest areas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some of the smashed rebels had fled to the
northern provinces of Malanje and Uige.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
shot dead and 13 injured in a shoot-out at a taxi rank in
Empangenion, northern KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Members of rival taxi associations opened fire on each other
with handguns, shotguns and heavy weapons at around 1:00 p.m.,
police spokesman Captain Vishnu Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicate that the conflict was between the
Esikhaweni Taxi Association and the Empangeni Taxi Association
over the long distance route between Empangeni and Esikhaweni in
northern KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said one of the associations arrived at the rank and

</P>
<P>
Police were on the scene at the time and intervened to stop the
fire. Nineteen firearms were captured and one person arrested,
Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
Provincial transport MEC S'Bu Ndebele condemned the massacre
and said a team from his department had worked with police in
trying to resolve the conflict in recent weeks.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu asked the
committee members to focus discussions on measures to reach
targets set for 2000 while opening the committee's eighth plenum
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency reported that Phieu laid stress on new and
breakthrough measures in accordance with the latest economic
developments, especially deflation, sales slump, lowered
purchasing power and unused capital in banks.
</P>
<P>
It is required that these measures be concretized and clarified
for each main industry, domain and locality, including
agriculture, light industry and exports, Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the assessment of this year's situation, the
Vietnamese party leader said it is important to place the
assessment in a context from late 1997 up to now when Vietnam's
economy has been adversely affected by the Asian
financial-economic crisis to pinpoint the nature of the situation
and degrees of impacts made by each subjective and objective
factor.
</P>
<P>
He said the year 2000 is a year of great significance as it
will mark the end of the movement of party building and
strengthening, which will become a regular task of the party later

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Recommended to Reform Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commission of Inquiry
into Education Thursday presented its final 680-page report to
President Robert Mugabe stressing the reform of the country's
education system.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he was happy that the 12-member commission had
compiled the report whose findings were essential for the
development of Zimbabwe's education system.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government would thoroughly study the
report and dwell on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the commission Caiphas Nziramasanga said the report
 recommended the establishment of four pathways through which
Zimbabwean students could take before entering universities.
</P>
<P>
Every pathway leads to university and at the same time gives
students (chances) to concentrate on fields they are best in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted the need for the establishment of a
teaching council which would set guidelines of who should be a
teacher in order to train people who have interests of students at
heart, he added.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry commission was set up last year to seek public
views on how to improve the education curriculum and make it
relevant to the country's needs.
</P>
<P>
Some critics had over the years argued that the Zimbabwe's
education system was too academic and did not give students a
chance to advance technologically.

CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Malawi signed here on

especially in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and visiting Malawian
Foreign and International Cooperation Minister Brown Mpinganjira
inked the agreement at the end of their talks, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Moussa told a joint press

Wednesday on a two-day visit, covered bilateral relations, the
present situation in Africa and the issue of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Malawi will soon open an embassy here, a move which will
"further strengthen joint action," Moussa was quoted by the news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he will review with his Malawian counterpart the
steps to advance trade and investment between the two countries.

attend an economic conference of the Common Market of Eastern and
Southern Africa, which will be hosted by Egypt in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A number of Iranian security
troops were killed or wounded on Wednesday in clashes with armed
bandits and drug smugglers, an Iranian official announced on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor General for Political and Security Affairs of
the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province Danial Molaie said
the clashes occurred in the mountainous Goornak near Iranshahr.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not give the exact number of the
casualties, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Molaie said the group of drug dealers and armed bandits were
engaged in trafficking various types of narcotics, particularly
morphine, in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
He said that 46 tons of various kinds of drugs, large
quantities of arms and ammunitions were confiscated and dozens of
drug traffickers were killed in the province since March 21, the
start of the current Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an Iranian official said 146 Iranian anti-drug
police were killed since the beginning of this Iranian year,
bringing the total number killed to this end to 2,088 since the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it spends over 8,000 billion rials (about 2.67
billion U.S. dollars) annually on fighting drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Criticizes Israel's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa warned Thursday that Israel's continued settlement
activities will likely lead to the depletion of confidence in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli settlement policy will wreak terrible havoc on the
peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, Moussa was quoted
by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israeli government to reconsider its policy
and halt the settlement activities on the occupied Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has approved expansion plans of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip at faster pace than his hard-line predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel and an active mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks, has
been critical of the settlement policy of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Moussa urged the United States to adopt a positive stance on
the issue and pressure Israel into stopping settlement expansion
and removing the illegal settlements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opposes Israel's settlement policy, describing it as
destructive to the peace process. But it refrained from openly
demanding Israel halt the activities.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel will negotiate, among other things,
the future of the settlements in the final-status talks, which
will substantially start Monday.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Cairo said Israel's settlement policy will be a
major hurdle to the progress of the negotiations.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday pledged to uphold the legacy of late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and to follow the path of peace blazed by his
commander and mentor.
</P>
<P>
Defying a suggestion by the General Security Service (GSS),
Barak spoke at a mass rally in Tel Aviv to mark the fourth
anniversary of Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people came to the Rabin Square, where
Rabin was gun down by a Jewish extremist on November 4, 1995, to
pay tribute to the late prime minister. They lit candles and held
banners in memory of him.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the fact that the rally was held at where Rabin was
killed stressed that the Israelis will continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The GSS has advised Barak not to speakly directly to the
gathering for fear that he might risk his life as his peacemaking
with the Palestinians has raised resistance from right-wing Jews,
who oppose territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated two years after he signed the historic
Oslo peace accord with the Palestinians, the first peace deal
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a former army chief of staff, has renewed commitment to
pursuing Rabin's policy since he took office in July.
</P>
<P>
He has signed an interim peace agreement with the Palestinians
and set out an ambitious timetable for reaching a permanent peace
deal with them by September next year.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Cohen Say Foreign Aid Helping America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen urged
Congress to reconsider its "shortsighted" proposal to cut foreign
aid, saying the aid is aiding Americans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Congress last month approved a
foreign aid spending bill which reduces more than 2 billion U.S.
dollars from President Bill Clinton's proposed Fiscal Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Such a cutback reflects a profound misunderstanding about the
world and America's place in it that our nation can ill afford,"
Albright and Cohen said in an opinion piece published in The
Washington Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the dangers including terrorism, international
crime and drug trafficking and weapons proliferation still remain.
</P>
<P>
To counter these and other threats, the United States also
need "first class diplomacy." "Unfortunately, in recent years,
resources have lagged behind responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
"Today we allocate less than one tenth of the portion of our
GDP that we did a generation ago to support overseas democracy and
growth.... We are the largest debtor to the United Nations," they
said.
</P>
<P>
They complained that only one penny out of every dollar the
federal government spends is used for foreign affairs programs.
</P>
<P>
"We have demonstrated that what is traditionally called
foreign aid is, in truth, aid to America," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
"For example, when we provide resources to dismantle nuclear
weapons in the former Soviet Union, or prevent cocaine from
reaching American shores, or train foreign police in
counter-terrorism, we are aiding America," they added.
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. helps nations in troubled parts of the world make
a transition from war to peace, it also advance "our interests and
make the job of our armed forces easier," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Taken together, our international programs help make our
citizens safer, our economy stronger, our world more stable and
our freedoms more secure," they affirmed.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Equal Observation to Humanitarian Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- All countries, big or small,
strong or weak, are equal before the humanitarian law, said a
Chinese official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 27th International Conference of the Red Cross
and the Red Crescent, head of the Chinese delegation Ambassador
Qiao Zonghuai said that it is not only the obligation of the weak
and small countries, but also that of the strong and big, to
enforce the Geneva Conventions and their protocols.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we cannot but point out that many problems
still exist in the current international practices in this
regard," said Qiao. "Assuming themselves the world gendarme, some
countries and regional military organization resort to force
against sovereign countries."
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, civilians, civilian installations or even
diplomatic facilities were bombed and internationally forbidden
weapons were used in some cases.
</P>
<P>
"These actions apparently run against not only humanitarian
law, but also the civilization of mankind and should be abandoned
totally," Qiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said that humanitarian operations should
be guided by the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter and the basic principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
"State sovereignty must be respected and internal affairs
should not be interfered in," he said. "Deviation from or
ignorance of these principles would leave room for wilful
interventions under the pretext of humanitarianism."
</P>
<P>
He also underscored that humanitarian activities should be
carried out in strict accordance with the principle of
humanitarianism, neutrality and fairness, and should not be used
to serve any political purpose.
</P>
<P>
"However, some recent abnormal international practices arouse
our anxieties," he said. "Some countries and country group either
adopt double-standard approach in dealing with humanitarian
situations in different regions, or seek strategic, military or
economic interests for themselves in the name of humanitarian
assistance."
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to attach sufficient
importance to the relief of humanitarian disaster in the African
continent, and to assist the relevant countries in stepping out of
disturbance and poverty.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. man convicted of
killing a gay college student was sentenced Thursday to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty
for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a
21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed
to spare him from lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
McKinney expressed regret for his role in the murder, which
spurred nationwide rallies for legislation against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what to say other than that I'm truly
sorry to the entire Shepard family," McKinney told the court.
</P>
<P>
A jury had found McKinney guilty Wednesday of felony murder,
kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive
life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton praised the jurors' decision, saying
"this verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to
have a tolerant law-abiding nation that celebrates our
differences, rather than deepening them."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our society who
lash out at those who are different," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iberoamerican Summit to Be a Success: Cuban FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The 9th Iberoamerican Summit
will be a success despite the sabotaging campaign and the absence
of some presidents, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque told Cuban television that "the island authorities
have no doubts about the success of the meeting, during which the
Iberoamerican leaders will see the efforts of the Cuban people to
advance, despite the hard conditions of the embargo the country
faces."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister referred to the recent denunciations made
by President Fidel Castro about a campaign against the summit, to
be held November 15 and 16 in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque said that "Washington has never liked these
Iberoamerican meetings and much less would like one to be held
successfully in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
Castro denounced in a five-hour appearance before the local
television, the campaign promoted by the U.S. Office of Interests
in Havana to raise obstacles to the recent visit to Cuba of
Illinois Govern George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
Castro called "desperation and a true hysteria" the attitude
"of the enemies of our country in the United Stated before the
triumphs in the national and international arena being harvested
by the Cuban revolution."
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister said of the absence in the summit -
for diverse reasons - of the presidents of Chile, Argentina,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica, that these will not cloud
"the successful development of the incoming summit."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Rise Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
jobless benefits increased last week after a sharp decline the
previous week, according to the Labor Department's report.
</P>
<P>
The report said Thursday that 288,000 people filed new claims
for unemployment benefits for the week ending October 30, up 8,000
from the previous week. That was the highest level since October
16, when claims were at 292,000.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims was down last week to
287,250. That was the lowest level since September 18, when claims
were at 286,000.
</P>
<P>
For the week ending October 23, 280,000 people filed jobless
claims, a decrease of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an
indication of an extremely tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also said Thursday that for the week
ending October 23, 39 states and territories reported increases in
new jobless claim applications while 14 reported decreases.
California had the biggest increase, 7,514, which was attributed
to layoffs in the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest drop was Ohio, down 3,085. Officials
gave no reason for the decline.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Development Plan Backed by Big Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (PCCI) Friday voiced support to the
government's Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) which
is set for full implementation from 1999-2004, Philippine News
Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
PCCI is an umbrella organization of the country's big
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction to the plan presentation made by Socio-Economic
Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla, also director-general of the
National Economic and Development Authority, PCCI President
Alberto Fenix suggested two important factors that could send the
Plan into a smooth sailing.
</P>
<P>
The MTPDP is geared towards attaining the objective of economic
growth with social equity, through a multistakeholder approach
involving a dynamic and internationally competitive business
sector, a vigilant and responsible civil society and an efficient
and impartial government.
</P>
<P>
Based on this goal, there is a strong need for the government
to consider the crafting of an effective and comprehensive
information dissemination campaign plan which is to be done on a
nationwide scale, Fenix said.
</P>
<P>
Since few of the masses know exactly what the MTPDP is all
about, he added, there is a need to work out such a plan so that
those in the countryside will be able to fully understand what the
government is trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the government set aside a budget for
this purpose.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The values of the civil
service in Hong Kong are to promote fairness, integrity,
responsiveness and courtesy, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 10th Zonta
International District 17 Conference, Chan said that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government is seeking to
filter right through its system some basic ethics.
</P>
<P>
"We stress that at all times civil servants must seek to
balance the interest of the broader community, those in need, the
employed, the unemployed and the business sector.
</P>
<P>
"Our advice must always be impartial and apolitical, drawing on
experience of what is practical," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the scale of the challenges the civil service now
faces has brought broader public sector reform right to the top of
the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
The civil service is well up to the challenges ahead and is
taking a balanced and pragmatic approach to meeting them head-on,
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a civil service that is motivated, modern and
able to meet the community's expectations," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the civil service's aims of serving the
community include fostering stability and prosperity, improving
the quality of life, caring for those in need, protecting the
rights and freedoms of the individual, maintaining the rule of law
and encouraging people to participate in their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We have used these aims therefore to develop a framework of
values and management principles which we have communicated widely
to provide practical guidance for civil servants," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"We defined four guiding principles to give a clear and
balanced direction to management tasks across the government and
so provide the momentum for continuous improvement - Being
Accountable, Living within Our Means, Developing Our Culture of
Service, and Managing for Performance," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the government is now much more open and accountable
than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
"We make a plethora of information available including policy
objectives, performance pledges, departmental estimates and annual
reports, and information on government's decisions and actions is
a right under the provision of our Code on Access to Information,"
she explained.
</P>
<P>
On the principle of "Living within Our Means", Chan said that
keeping spending in line with Hong Kong's GDP growth has enabled
the government to build up the reserves that are helping Hong Kong
cope with current rainy days.
</P>
<P>
"Our 'Culture of Service' requires us to be every bit as
passionate about customer service as the private sector - perhaps
even more so because our customers often have nowhere else to go,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly, we are now listening much more to our
customers and there are many visible examples around town of
better service environments and considerable improvements in
process times and the range of services available," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Looking forward, new technology offers opportunities for us to
further improve and transform the way we deliver services, moving
away from over the counter services to the use of electronic
service delivery, one-stop shop, call centers and the like," Chan
added.
</P>
<P>
As regards "Managing for Performance", she said the government
has recognized that there are limits to the improvements it can
achieve through these initiatives focused on internal control and
external customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
"We must also change the way in which we manage performance and
resources across the government as a whole," she said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Presents Medium-Term Plan 1999-2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Friday presented to the public its "Medium-Term Philippine
Development Plan, 1999-2004: Making It Work," the Philippine News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The presentation was made by Director-General Felipe Medalla of
the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) before the
country's economists and representatives from both the public and
the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Medalla said: "Taking off from the strengths of
the previous plans as well as learning from their weaknesses, the
Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 1999-2004 envisions a
sustainable development path anchored on growth with social
equity."
</P>
<P>
He continued, "The overall achievement of this plan vision will
be measured in large part by a reduction in poverty especially in
the rural areas and an improvement in the distribution of income."
</P>
<P>
Medalla stressed that there is a need to reverse the pattern of
income distribution in the country, adding that the number of poor
families and the incidence of poverty must be reduced from 32
percent in 1997 to 25-28 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
"Access of the disadvantaged to government institutions must be
improved, and rural areas and regions outside the national capital
region must have a larger contribution to economic growth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To realize these, the national government plans to tap all
sectors like social, political, cultural and economic to help
strengthen the foundation and facilitate the mobilization of
resources and institutions in order to pursue the plan's vision.
</P>
<P>
However, the NEDA chief believed that this vision will not
succeed without political stability, peace and order and the
growing reliability of the established judicial processes.
</P>
<P>
He also added that the pursuit of this vision lies on the
continued and strong leading role of a more competitive private
sector to create productive employment opportunities for a greater
number of people.
</P>
<P>
"This shall take through the production and delivery of goods
and services in markets that are increasingly integrated with the
global economy with the government taking an active role in
reducing barriers to entry and asymmetry of information," he said.
</P>
<P>
The priority areas in the plan's blueprint include acceleration
of rural development, delivery of basic social development
services, strengthening competitiveness, sustained development of
infrastructure, ensuring macroeconomic stability and the
reformation of governance.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Sahara Sees 1.2 Pct. Growth in 1994-98: PTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa saw a 1.2
percent a year economic growth during the period from 1994 to
1998, PTA Bank, or the Eastern and Southern African Trade and
Development Bank, said in its annual report released in Lusaka
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the region's improved performance largely
to such domestic factors as lower incidence of civil strife,
greater macro economic stability, and significant progress in
liberalizing markets and privatizing state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Countries that did better on these fundamentals, like Uganda
and Mauritius, reaped the benefits of improved economic efficiency
and grew at 5.5 percent on average during this period, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It was recognized that restructuring, globalization and
export-led expansion are the keys for these African countries to
build their competitiveness in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is likely to exceed three
percent, well above the global average of 2.5 percent, PTA Bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that even if the IMF projections prove
over-optimistic, a number of countries and sectors are likely to
perform well.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has praised the increasing number of African countries
that are adopting market-oriented policies, while also undertaking
democratic reforms, reducing military expenditures and
strengthening public institutions and civil society.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Well Protected in HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Human rights in Hong Kong are
extremely well protected and anyone who lives in Hong Kong or
knows it well recognizes it is a free city, a high-ranking Hong
Kong official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three tiers of protection have been established to ensure human
rights in Hong Kong since it returned to China in 1997, said
Robert Allcock, acting solicitor general, at a press briefing
following Hong Kong's human rights report to the U.N. Human Rights
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We have the domestic legislation in Hong Kong, the Bill of
Rights Ordinance, which protects human rights in Hong Kong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, the constitutional level, entrenches the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and
no law in Hong Kong can contravene the Basic Law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The third level is the international law level," he said. "
International covenant applies to Hong Kong as a matter of
international law."
</P>
<P>
Allcock said that the U.N. Human Rights Committee was very
pleased that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was
continuing to report under the ICCPR after its return to China and
that the committee praised the quality of the SAR government's
written report.
</P>
<P>
In regard to some concerns raised at the committee, the
official said some concerns were based on misunderstanding of the
facts and in general, the concerns were not about abuses of human
rights in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the main concern over China's National People's
Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) interpretation of the Basic
Law last June seems to relate to the right of fair hearing under
Article 14 of the ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of
his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be
entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent
and impartial tribunal established by law, he cited the article as
saying.
</P>
<P>
There was concern about whether the interpretation had in any
way undermined that right, he said, noting that no one has been
deprived of the right to such a fair hearing by the courts of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The NPCSC interpretation was not itself a determination of an
individual's rights and obligations in a suit at law, but was a
legislative act, defining what the law is, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The judgment obtained in those cases in the Court of Final
Appeal had been entirely undisturbed by the interpretation and
both the right of hearing and the judgment were respected, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the Basic Law is a national law, not just a piece of
Hong Kong law.
</P>
<P>
"The national institution should have the final power to
interpret it," he noted. "As you wouldn't expect the state of
California to have the power to interpret the U.S. Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong gets
common law jurisdiction as a region within civil law jurisdiction,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The court retains the power to decide the case and the final
power to interpret the Basic Law is in the NPCSC," he said.

<P>
ALMA ATA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Six member countries of the
CIS Collective Security Pact, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Belarus, attended a meeting on Thursday in
Bischkek, the capital city of Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The countries decided to establish a committee to improve and
coordinate tactics against international terrorists, which are
reportedly threatening the stability and security of central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to establish an Islamic state in central Asian districts,
the terrorists and religious extremists organize and recruit
illegal militants and set up underground organizations, those
attending the meeting affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists are also colluding with drug traffickers to
raise funds for their terrorist activities. It is believed by some
of those at the meeting that illegal militants may invade
Kyrgyzstan next spring.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the CIS countries concluded that
they must improve their collective security measures and make
preparations to wipe out all illegal militants and fight
uncompromisingly against terrorists.

<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua)-- The supervision of courts by
people's congresses at all levels will help create a fair judicial
system, said top legislator Li Peng today at the State College of
Judges.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said that the people's congresses and their
standing committees have the right to supervise the work of the
administrative, judicial, and procuratorate organs of the state.
</P>
<P>
To further improve supervision, the NPC Standing Committee is
deliberating draft regulations on supervising major cases in the
judicial process, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"However, such supervision will not affect the independence of
judicial organs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The State College of Judges was founded in 1997 as a state
training center for senior judges in China. In the past two years,
2,300 judges have graduated from the College.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Cable and Wireless HKT Posts Interim Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong's telecom giant
Cable and Wireless HKT Friday announced an interim loss of 2.76
billion HK dollars (355 million U.S. dollars) for the six months
to September, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Linus W. L. Cheung, chief executive of the Cable and Wireless
HKT Limited, attributed the net loss to severe competition in
international and mobile markets.
</P>
<P>
"Our first-half results reflect the increasingly challenging
market environment in Hong Kong, which is now one of the most open
and competitive telecommunications markets in the world," Cheung
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, our results also highlight the dramatic growth in
demand for new Internet and e-commerce services," Cheung added.
</P>
<P>
The firm, known until July as Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.,
posted a 6.09 billion HK dollar (780 million U.S. dollars) profit
in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The latest result included a one-off loss of 7.08 billion HK
dollars, representing write-downs and write-offs on the carrying
value of certain fixed and other assets.
</P>
<P>
The telecom giant said the result came on a 17.3-percent drop
in sales to 14.18 billion HK dollars. However, the board of
directors declared a final dividend of 38.6 cents, unchanged from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A strong growth was registered in the firm's value-added
services, data and Internet products, which represent some 23
percent of its total turnover, and its operating costs were
reduced, according to Cheung.

<P>
"We have made great progress in achieving our e-vision to bring
the benefits of our broadband network, the Internet and e-commerce
to our customers in Hong Kong," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
"Cable and Wireless HKT is committed to continue to develop
Hong Kong as the leading e-commerce center for the Asia region
through substantial investment in advanced technology and services,
" Cheung added.
</P>
<P>
Cheung commented on the company's future development, saying
the combined competition from local and global operators is likely
to present further significant challenges for the company, but "we
are building on our performance culture to transform and reshape
our business and we will continue to be one of the most
competitive telecommunications carriers in the world."
</P>
<P>
Investors in the Hong Kong stock market were reportedly
startled by the news that Cable and Wireless HKT posted an interim
loss and the Hang Seng Index was pulled down by 41.24 points to
close at 13,610.27 Friday.
</P>
<P>
But they said other local telecom companies had made similar
write-offs and Cable and Wireless HKT was merely cleaning the air.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan President Wants Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has said in a letter made public Friday that she
intended to initiate talks with the Tamil rebels as soon as it was
"practically possible."
</P>
<P>
The president's position came as the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels said Friday that they have
overrun three key military bases in the country's north, killing
more than 1,000 troops this week.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to her main rival in next month's presidential
election Ranil Wickremesinghe, President Kumaratunga said, "I have
to regretfully conclude that you do not have any genuine interest
in developing a bipartisan approach to the solution of our ethnic
problem."
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, I intend to wait no longer for you to
respond to the proposals we made four years ago. Instead, I intend
to initiate discussions with the LTTE as soon as it is practically
possible to do so," Kumaratunga said in her letter to
Wickremesinghe, leader of the main opposition United National
Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
However, the president did not elaborate on the peace talks in
the letter which was dated Monday (November 1) but was made
available to the public on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe exchanged letters in October,
accusing each other of not doing enough to end the 16-year-old
ethnic war between the majority Sinhalese-dominated troops and the
minority Tamil rebels who demand a separate homeland in Sri
Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has long blamed the UNP for offering
little or no help to the government's devolution package to solve
the ethnic issue.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the devolution package, requiring a two-thirds
majority in the parliament, can only be realized with the help of
the UNP, which however said the package is not the right way to
solve the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga has advanced the presidential election to December
21 in a bid to push through the political package.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League (PML),
the leading political party in Pakistan headed by ousted Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, Friday decided to challenge the October 12
army takeover in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
PML's Legal Committee, which met under the chairmanship of
former Law Minister Khalid Anwar, asked its coordinating council
to challenge the army takeover in the Supreme Court, said a PML
statement issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the October 12 action was illegal,
unconstitutional, nonpolitical and immortal and expressed its
concern over the house arrest of the deposed prime minister and
others for the last 25 days.
</P>
<P>
The army dismissed the civilian Sharif government in a coup on
October 12 and has since then kept Sharif and some of his close
allies, including his brother Shahbaz Sharif and former
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain, in custody.
</P>
<P>
PML's Legal Committee said no one knows where these people have
been kept and what the state of their health is.
</P>
<P>
The committee noted that no case has been registered against
any of the arrested persons and they have not been presented
before any court. It asked the army to provide all facilities
under international laws to these people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji urged
officials at all levels to attach greater importance to product
quality and ensure necessary funds for quality inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the national meeting on product
quality which has just ended, Zhu said that in China's crucial
stage of economic development, quality improvement is extremely
important.
</P>
<P>
"Without quality, there would be no economic benefits, and if
shoddy and low-quality products were not effectively checked, the
country would have no future," Zhu warned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was convened by the State Council from
November 4 to 5, focused on mapping out a plan to improve quality
inspection.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Vice Premier Wu Bangguo said that the problem
of product quality needs to be understood and dealt with from the
overall strategy of economic development. "Quality First" must be
implemented nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Wu called for the establishment of scientific and advanced
quality standards, improving the building of metric checking
systems and imposing strict quality inspections on products
entering the market. He also urged enterprises to adopt strict
quality standards in production and improve technical renovation
to make sure that consumers' interests are fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"While improving product quality, the campaign against shoddy
and low-quality products must be carried out," Wu said, adding
that the campaign must be as severe as cracking down on smuggling.

economic and trade boosting proposals put forward by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin during his visit to Mongolia last July.
</P>
<P>

MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of counterfeit treasury
notes and bonds worth billions of U.S. dollars have been
confiscated by a composite police team and the U.S. Secret Service
in the southern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency (PNA) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seven persons allegedly connected with the case were also

</P>
<P>
The raid in Cagayan De Oro, capital city of Misamis Oriental

operatives of the city police office, the U.S Secret Service, the
National Intelligence Coordinating Council and the Philippine
Central Bank (PCB).
</P>

A total of 2.2 billion dollars' worth of fake treasury notes
and liberty bonds were found, including 500 liberty bonds, 1,457
U.S. Federal Reserve notes, two Federal Reserve certificates, 10
U.S. Treasury certificates, two genuine 1,000-dollar bills, two
genuine 1-dollar bills and nine counterfeit U.S. Federal Reserve

<TEXT>
<P>
The Burundian refugees repatriation program carried out by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Tanzania
was suspended following the killing of two U.N. aid workers in
Burundi last month.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the suspension, an average of 200 Burundians were
voluntarily returning home from Tanzania every week over the past
10 months,
</P>
<P>
The latest release of the UNHCR said that the outlook for some
275,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania has become more uncertain
as a result of the suspension of repatriation and doubts about the
future of Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Burundian Foreign Minister Severin Ntahomvukiye is due to visit
 Tanzania and Uganda next week to discuss the future of the
country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian government reportedly said it will get
in touch with the UNHCR and other international bodies, delivering
services to refugees to ensure that all refugees are treated
equally across the world.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian deputy minister of foreign affairs Emmanuel
Mwambulukutu said his government is aware that there is disparity
in the treatment of refugees in Tanzania and those in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR and other international agencies and non-governmental
 organizations contributed some 13.3 billion Tanzanian shillings
(about 16.6 million U.S.dollars) between 1995 and 1999 for the
rehabilitation of roads in refugee-affected regions of Kigoma and
Kagera in northwest Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the UNHCR allocates 1.6 U.S. dollars to a
refugee in Kosovo and other European countries per day while a
refugee in Tanzania can only get about 15 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The continuing insecurity in neighboring Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda has forced large number of refugees
to cross into Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The northwest Kigoma and Kagera regions shelter more than
200,000 refugees from these countries.

Demand for flights through the millennium roll-over are usually
much lower than normal. "These are special dates and it's expected
of people to celebrate at home than travel," Roberto Rivera, PAL
Y2K project head, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
People who travel around New Year's Eve, on the other hand,
usually fly earlier for a longer holiday and want to be at their
destinations by the millennium night.

PAL has started testing its contingency plans to cover
potential problems during the roll-over since it announced its
100-percent Y2K compliance for mission critical systems on
October 15.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting the challenge of Y2K is not about making sure our
systems are Y2K compliant. It's also making sure that if any of
these systems fail because of outside forces, we should be able
to conduct our business as close to normal as possible using
contingency plans," Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
While no one knows what is really going to happen when the
clock strikes midnight on December 31, PAL is confident that
planes will not be falling from the skies.
</P>
<P>
"The actual piloting of an aircraft does not depend on dates.
So there's no way Y2K will jeopardize safety-on-board," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Already, PAL has spent 800 million pesos (20 million U.S.
dollars) for Y2K computer repairs since 1996. The amount covers
replacements and upgrading of existing systems and equipment.

scientific and technological standards as well as the he nation's
creativity, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of military arms on display at the

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Kills 86 in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Food poisoning has killed 86
people across China this year, sounding an alarming bell of food
safety to the Chinese and public health administration.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health said that 85 food poisoning cases were
reported in the January-October period in which 4,638 people were
affected. Most of the incidents, however, occurred during the
summer and autumn season.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official told the press today that lack of sanitary
measures in food processing and selling, abuse of food additives,
inedible materials in food making and mistaken intakes of toxic
things such as mushroom were major causes of the poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the cases reported bacteria contamination,
chemical poisoning was more fatal claiming the lives of more than
60 people, said Zhao Tonggang of the ministry's department of
health laws and supervision.
</P>
<P>
Zhao acknowledged that hygiene problems existing in food
processing have led to lots of poisoning in school canteens and
restaurants. Poor management of some pesticides and rat poison was
another hidden danger.
</P>
<P>
"About 70 percent of food poisoning cases are related to
pesticides," Zhao said, adding that some pesticides that have been
banned by the government are still produced and used in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, deputy minister of health, urged health
administrative departments at all levels to publish food poisoning
cases regularly so that public awareness against food poisoning
can be raised.
</P>
<P>
Two books introducing know-how about food poisoning and first-
aid measures to medical workers and ordinary people were published
today as part of the preventive measures taken by the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Former Falun Gong Activist Denounces "Mystical Powers" of Cult Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi, leader of the
illegal Falun Gong cult, called himself a saint and asked others
to follow his "mystical powers". But even some of his staunchest
believers have begun to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Lixun, former head of the general station of Falun Gong in
Jilin Province, northeast China, said that to define Falun Gong as
a heretical cult has accurately exposed its evil nature as well as
Li Hongzhi's true face as an anti-government cult leader.
</P>
<P>
Li, a native of Changchun, capital city of Jilin, had used
natural phenomena to show his "mystical powers", Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, when a comet hit Jupiter, Li Hongzhi told his local
followers that the comet was supposed to have hit Earth and his "
mystical powers" had diverted the comet, according to Jiao. Li
said only by following him in practicing Falun Gong could man be
saved from natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Jiao said that Li asked his followers to obey him and
brainwashed them with his video-taped speeches and books, while
collecting money by selling these things and giving lectures.

<HEADLINE> Angolans Warned Against UNITA's New Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan ruling party has
appealed to the countrymen to keep on the alert against the new
strategy adopted by the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), official source said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are engaged in developing a "dilatory strategy"
against the government and the leadership of the People's
Liberation Movement of Angola, according to a document issued by
the branch of the ruling party in Huambo Province which has been
suffering the most fierce battles and serious humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA said that the rebels will engage themselves to
sabotage military and civilian facilities in cities and towns,
with bridges, streets, factories, hospitals, schools and other
vital departments being their main objectives.
</P>
<P>
The document pointed out that the UNITA rebels at the order of
Jonas Savimbi are also dedicated into the sabotage of economic
targets.
</P>
<P>
The rebels will support their armed rebellion by abducting the
citizens and forcing them to join their ranks, ambushing vehicles
in highways and re-planting mines along the principal roads
around the country, according ] to the document.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA said that the rebels will not give up their armed
rebellion and will not disarm by themselves, "unless they are
militarily, politically and economically defeated."
</P>
<P>
It said that the new strategy of the Savimbists is "the result
of the resounding victory achieved and consolidated by the
government in the political, military, economic, social-cultural
and diplomatic fields."
</P>
<P>
After a crush defeat by the government troops in the central
plateau, the rebels have been driven into forest areas and have
been forced to adopt new strategy in a bid to avoid face-to-face
confrontation with the government troops.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- During the last few weeks, Syrian authorities  interrogated
600 to 800 alleged sympathizers of President Hafez al-Assad's
exiled brother Rifa'at, after an attack was launched toward the
support base of Rifa'at in Syria, Western diplomatic sources have
confirmed to The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the attack was a sort of
preemptive strike by Assad against his brother to prevent a
challenge to Assad's son, Bashar, for the Syrian succession.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Israeli defense officials were sharply critical
Thursday of a compromise reached over the funding of the Wye
accord under which Israel will forgo early disbursements of its
regular military aid from the United States so that Washington
can use the interest earned on the delayed payment to fund Wye.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials say that Israel's willingness to go along
with this arrangement is a big mistake, saying it set a dangerous
precedent of forgoing an important political and economic gift.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged Thursday night to
follow the vision of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and keep
moving the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a memorial ceremony marking the fourth anniversary
of Rabin's assassination, Barak said Israel should move forward
to peace and Israel's strength is in the unity of all its parts.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Christian leaders in the Holy Land said Thursday that they
would close their churches for two days on November 22 and 23 to
protest plans for building a mosque near the main Christian shrine
in Nazareth, the town where Jesus spent his childhood.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a compromise reached between the
government and Muslim leaders in Nazareth which allows the
Muslims to build a mosque on part of a disputed area before the
church, Basilica of the Annunciation.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Formulate Anti-Dumping Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
formulating an anti-dumping law in a bid to offset the impact of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement which Nigeria signed
in 1995, Commerce Minister Mustafa Bello has said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will soon be presented to the National Executive
Council for approval and later to the National Assembly
(parliament) for enactment, the minister told an on-going national
seminar on "the implication of the WTO Agreement on the Nigerian
economy".
</P>
<P>
He was responding queries on why Nigeria signed the agreement
without considering the impact on the Nigerian economy at a
seminar held in capital Abuja, This Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the problem has to be given a legislative
solution. That is why we are working at getting a law on it,"
Bello said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Alhaji Umaru Shehu, the national
president of Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, noted that most clauses
in the agreement are not in the interest of developing countries
and therefore implored Nigeria to negotiate the terms with the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Citing the directive of environmental standards, he said that
when developed countries start sanctioning defaulting countries
from next year, they will also start dumping on the
under-developed world.
</P>
<P>
Shehu suggested that Nigeria should constitute a team of
experienced technocrats to enter into negotiation on the serious
problem of dumping.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiation rounds that gave birth to the WTO,
African countries including Nigeria and other developing countries
were not adequately represented, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This necessitated the need for further negotiations in order to
protect local industries and the Nigerian economy from the massive
dumping of foreign finished goods, Shehu said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Central Bank Warns Against Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea warned Friday
against inflation in the coming months due to additional
production costs, including labor and imported raw material.
</P>
<P>
"Cost-related factors, such as increases in import prices and
unit-labor costs, may also build inflationary pressure in the
coming months. We cannot be optimistic about inflation in the
future any longer," the central bank Governor Chon Chol-hwan said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the central bank to express a
pessimistic outlook on future inflation since South Korea began to
see economic recovery after it suffered a financial crisis
triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts described Chon's remarks as hints that the central
bank may adopt a tighter monetary policy once the domestic
financial market has been stabilized.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor said despite fears of inflation, the
South Korean government has decided to maintain the nation's
current short-term interest rates this month to help settle the
financial market as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South Korea's consumer prices rose 0.8 percent from
the previous month, marking the third consecutive month-to-month
rise. The consumer prices in October rose 1.2 percent over the
same period last year and was 1.7 percent up over the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent task facing the South Korean government
currently is to stabilize the domestic financial market, Chon said,
assuring that there will be no change in monetary policy for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
He said his bank will closely monitor the real economy and the
movement of asset prices to prevent inflationary pressure from
rising.
</P>
<P>
In line with the policy, the central bank will maintain the
call rate, or the benchmark short-term interest rate, at its
current level of 4.7 percent, he added.

communication services declined in comparison. In June, online
communication users logged on for an average of 39 minutes daily,
slightly down from 41 minutes recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also revealed that more time is being spent

items in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's historic trip to
Russia, which came just after his visit to the United States and
just before the century's last summit of the OSCE gets underway in
Istanbul, has a wide spectrum of topics on the agenda, ranging
from the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) to the Blue Stream project.
</P>
<P>
"We will have the opportunity to issue a reminder that the
support given to the PKK separatist terrorist organization by some
Russian circles is not compatible with friendly relations," said
Ecevit at the airport on Thursday before leaving for Moscow for a
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- Officials of the Russian Gasprom and Turkish Botas
companies have completed the text of the Tax Protocol of the Blue
Stream Project. However, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is
undecided whether to sign it or not and this has disturbed Russian
officials.
</P>
<P>
A strain over the Blue Stream Project has clouded Ecevit's
ongoing visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who arrived in
Strasbourg to attend the Council of European Ministers Committee,
assessed the latest positions of Turkey and the European Union
(EU) in a meeting with his Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
"The time to talk has passed, everyone is waiting for the
result," said Cem, adding that he approaches cautiously to
Turkey's EU candidacy. "I don't look at the situation as a fait
accompli."
</P>
<P>
Cem, who will meet EU foreign ministers during the summit of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul, said that the road to Turkey's possible acceptance by
the EU as a candidate state wouldn't be difficult and long.

PHNOM PENH, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Council for Development
of Cambodia had approved more than 3.653 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign direct investment (FDI) projects since August 1994 to the
end of October this year, according to Friday's Vision.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian ventures have the largest share with 421 projects
estimated at 820 million dollars, followed by the Taiwan region
with 157 projects at an estimated registered capital of 294
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
China stands third with 146 projects and 217 million dollars
while Hong Kong, China, has 103 projects and 98 million dollars,
Singapore 82 projects and 162 million dollars and Malaysia 79
projects and 1.5 billion dollars in registered investment capital.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 countries and regions have placed their investment in
Cambodia though the investment figures for 1999 dropped due to the
regional financial crisis and other factors.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector continued to be the major area of investment
and major export revenue earner for the country, but it was
learned that the sector has slowed down with the imposition of
export quota to the United States, the Cambodian garment sector's
biggest export destination.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite positive
developments in oil exploration in the coastal Mandawa area in
Kilwa District in southern Tanzania, no oil has been discovered
there so far, the Daily News newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions Thursday in the parliament which is in
session in the central town of Dodoma, Deputy Minister for Energy
and Minerals Manju Nsambya said that the government was not able
to announce the results of the exploration work because no oil has
been found so far.
</P>
<P>
Underground oil exploration work must consider a number of
technical factors and this needs time and patience, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an industry official announced that significant oil
and gas reserves have been found in some 12 wells in the coastal
region of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal to Release Rwanda Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has agreed to release a
suspect for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda for delay of trial,
according to a press release reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Appeals Chamber sitting at The Hague, the Netherlands,
has granted an appeal by detainee Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza for his
unconditional immediate release from the Tribunal's custody in
Tanzania to Cameroon, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In a decision dated November 3, the Appeals Chamber directed
the Tribunal's Registrar to "make necessary arrangements for the
delivery of the Appellant to the Authorities of Cameroon,"
according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, former Director of Political Affairs in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Rwanda at the time of the genocide,
was transferred to the Tribunal in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha on November 19, 1997 from Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with six counts of genocide, complicity in
genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public
incitement to genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded not guilty to these charges on February 23, 1998 and
filed a motion seeking to nullify his arrest, but his motion was
dismissed by the Tribunal on November 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Appeals Chamber concluded that the Tribunal's Prosecutor
failed to take the steps necessary to have the Appellant
transferred to the Tribunal' s custody in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chamber, Barayagwiza's initial appearance, 96
days after his transfer, violated his right to be brought before a
Trial Chamber without delay.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza's right to be promptly informed of the charges
against him was also violated by the Prosecution during the first
period of the Appellant's detention in Cameroon, the Chamber said.
</P>
<P>
The Registry has initiated action to implement the Chamber's
instructions on Barayagwiza's release, according to the press
release.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals, 38 of them now taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans were reportedly killed during the
1994 genocide when the majority Hutus oppressed the minority
Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Record Attacks on Israeli Forces in S. Lebanon in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's resistance groups
staged 280 attacks on Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon
in October, the highest ever registered in a one-month period, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the attacks were carried out by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian Amal
movement led by Lebanon's House Speaker Nabih Berri, with a
handful by the multi-faith Lebanese Resistance Brigades, a couple
by the Communist-led National Resistance Movement and one by
Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the monthly figures have climbed steadily since
a brief lull in July. August recorded 190 attacks and September
220.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) Timur Goksel told the paper that there were two main
reasons behind the dramatic increase.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah is determined to show that the Israeli air attacks
are not working and that they are continuing fighting," he said,
adding another reason is that there has been an increase in minor
attacks by Amal.
</P>
<P>
Amal, which returned to the front line two months ago, claimed
to have launched almost half of the total attacks in October, most
of them being routine mortar attacks with one or two rounds each.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 121 operations.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have begun responding to resistance operations
with air strikes in a bid to minimize ground troops casualties.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said Israeli soldiers are rarely seen outside their
reinforced concrete bunkers, providing the resistance groups with
fewer targets.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the attacks by the resistance groups
took on two major features in October: the increased use of the
107 mm short-range Katyusha rockets and the return to roadside
bomb ambushes.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac warned on Thursday against a
growing gap of wealth between the rich countries and the poor
countries and expressed concern about the negative effects which
the economic globalization is bringing to the world. Chirac made
the warning to participants of a seminar on international affairs,
including some heads of state, invited by the French Institute of
International Relations.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Socialist Party officials involved in the scandal
of the student's health association MNEF were the same who
manoevered for the selling of armaments to Taiwan during the
Mitterrand era. The former Minister of Finance and Economy
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned this week for suspected
forgery and creating fictitious jobs, made secret trips to Taiwan
in the early 1990s in connection with the armaments deals.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Recent judicial investigation showed that some top officials
of the French Socialist Party were involved in creating fictitious
jobs in the students' health association MNEF. These Socialist
officials -- some of whom are close to Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin -- are also connected with the ``France-Taiwan Frendship''
association which is affiliated to the MNEF.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, Andrei Grachev, former
advisor of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, explained why the
latter yielded when the Berlin Wall fell in the night of September
8, 1989. He said that Gorbachev was determined to modernize the
Soviet economy, which obliged him to stop the costly arms race
with the United States. Gorbachev told the leaders of Warsaw Pact
countries in 1986 that from then on, they should no longer rely on
the military protection of Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) - Lions and leopards have
killed a total of 21 people in southern Tanzania in the first 10
months of this year, the Daily Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister for Lands and Human Settlement Development
of Tanzania Mudhihir Mohamed Mudhihir told the paper Thursday that
22 other people were injured by the wild animals during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
"The problem which surfaced last January has been on the
increase although the Department of Wildlife has hunted and killed
some of the lions," Mudhihir said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that the Ministry for Natural
Resources and Tourism has provided 50 rounds of ammunition and
deployed some game scouts to the affected region to kill the
animals.
</P>
<P>
Crocodiles were also causing havoc to residents in the region,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is famous for its wildlife protection, but villagers
often complained that lions, crocodiles and other fierce animals
pose threats to their security.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Navy Declines to Join Exercise With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli navy has
declined to participate in a joint naval exercise on Monday with a
NATO flotilla visiting Israel's northern seaport of Haifa, the
local daily Jerusalem Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) officials said the
invitation had been given in advance to the Israeli navy. However,
NATO was informed that the Israeli navy will be involved in its
own maneuvers at that time and that none of its vessels will be
available to take part in the search-and-rescue exercise.
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Israeli Defense Force told the daily that
Israeli naval officers are scheduled to go with the NATO's
vessels to observe the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The flotilla, comprising six frigates from Turkey, Greece,
Spain, Holland, Germany and Italy and two destroyers from the
United States and Britain, arrived in Haifa on Wednesday, and is
due to remain until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, known as NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean,
is commanded by R.-Adm Feyyaz Ogutcu from aboard his flagship, the
Turkish frigate TGG Bararos.
</P>
<P>
Ogutcu told the daily that the flotilla was activated in
1992 to serve primarily as an immediate-reaction force for
NATO's southern region.
</P>
<P>
It also involved in the enforcement of the U.N. embargo on the
former Yugoslavia. More recently, it operated in the Adriatic as
part of NATO's efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, comprising 1,600 personnel, makes goodwill visits
to countries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to promote
so-called peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It previously visited Israel in 1994 and has also been to
Egypt, Tunisia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> US Adopts Policy of Wait &AMP; See Towards Pak: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan
William B. Milam said Friday the United States has adopted a
"watch and wait" policy towards the change in Pakistan as it was
not still aware what would be the overall policies of the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after inaugurating a conference on
American studies, the U.S. envoy said the new government was
framing itself so the United States was waiting to see "overall
what policies it would adopt."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the inclusion of people from the civil
society in the Federal Cabinet is a "good thing."
When asked if President Bill Clinton would be visiting Pakistan
during his forthcoming visit to South Asia, Milam said no final
decision has yet been taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the U.S. sanctions on Pakistan, the ambassador
said the U.S. Senate has requested President Clinton to delay
lifting of sanctions against Pakistan, adding that given the
Senate request the Clinton Administration is in a "dilemma."
</P>
<P>
When asked what is the position of the U.S. on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Milam said the U.S.
Administration and the Executive Branch are still strongly in
favor of CTBT and will continue to adhere its provisions despite
the U.S. Senate's refusal to ratify it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Strongly Opposes U.S. Senate Committee Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature today
expressed "indignation and strong opposition" to a resolution
passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. Senate on
November 2, according to a statement by the head of the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which supports Taiwan's access into the World
Health Organization (WHO), has disregarded China's sovereignty and
seriously violated the basic international norms and the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is known that the WHO is an inter-governmental organization
which is made up of sovereign states, and that Taiwan, as a part
of China, is not at all qualified to join the organization, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has affirmed on many occasions that it will
adhere to the "one China" policy and that it will not support "the
independence of Taiwan," "two Chinas," and "one China, one Taiwan,
" nor will it support Taiwan's access into any international
organization that only admits sovereign states, the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, a small number of U.S. senators, regardless of the
overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations and running counter to
the commitment of the U.S. government, have grossly interfered in
China's internal affairs by supporting Taiwan's access into the
WHO, which supports Taiwan's attempt to create "two Chinas." The
move has been detrimental to the improvement and development of
Sino-U.S. relations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. Senate, proceeding from the overall
situation of Sino-U.S. relations in the next century, will not
allow this resolution to be passed," the statement emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the U.S. government strictly abide by the
principles of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant
commitments of the U.S. side, and explicitly oppose the resolution
to facilitate the improvement and development of Sino-U.S.
relations," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: U.S. Colorado Residents Want Stricter Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Most residents in Colorado
State in the U.S. want to see stricter gun laws, including making
it illegal to own assault weapons, according to a survey conducted
and released by University of Colorado Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two percent of the 900 people responding to the survey
supported expanding state law to require background checks before
weapons are sold at gun shops. Automatic weapons are already
banned under federal law.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three percent favored prohibiting the sale of any gun to
anyone under 18. Colorado law permits the sale of rifles and
shotguns to minors. Seventy-three percent favored banning all
sales of semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in August and September, is the first one
since two heavily armed teenage gunmen shot 13 people to death at
a local high school before killing themselves on April 20.
</P>
<P>
Earlier polls showed the majority of the people in Colorado
supported the same measures but that support was less than 60
percent at that time, according to Marshall Kaplan, director of
the university's institute for public policy.
</P>
<P>
The increased support is a clear indication that the April 20
massacre at Columbine High School has shifted public opinion,
Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
Denver Mayor Wellington Webb said he would make the study
available to state lawmakers who are expected to take up a bill
allowing concealed weapons next January.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Upgrading of Product Quality (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A People's Daily editorial to
be published tomorrow calls for lifting China's product quality up
to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, to be released at the end of a national meeting
on product quality, says that China's economy has entered into a
new phase of growth, where major commodities have shifted from the
sellers' market to the buyers' market.
</P>
<P>
"The work to raise product quality constitutes the direction of
the main attack at a crucial juncture of the economic restructure
of the Chinese economy, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Improving and upgrading product quality is not only vital for
meeting the needs of the domestic market, expanding exports and
improving the whole economic performance, but is also essential
for fulfilling the country's lofty cross-century objective to
enhance the comprehensive national strength and international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Since the convocation of the last national meeting on product
quality in 1992, the editorial notes, the country's quality
management has been beefed up, its overall product quality greatly
improved and the quality of some products have even met or been
approaching to the world's advanced level.
</P>
<P>
However, there remains a big gap between the present quality of
products and the economic development and world advanced standards.
Poor quality has had a negative impact on economic development and
the improvement of the people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The editorial further acknowledges that it is imperative to
fully recognize the importance and urgency of enhancing the
country's product quality management and quality of products.
</P>
<P>
"Quality responsibility is weightier than Mount Tai," the
editorial says, and leading officials of government at all levels
should attach close importance to and render an enthusiastic
support to quality supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
Moreover, the editorial says, it is imperative to further
improve the quality control mechanisms, step up technical
renovation, enhance government supervision and law enforcement in
the process of raising product quality.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, monitoring and spot-checking the quality of
products should be conducted on a continuous basis, especially
those major products that are vital to people's livelihood and
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that improving product quality hinges upon
the effective punishment of criminal activities of producing and
marketing shoddy goods.
</P>
<P>
Those businesses and their managers held responsible for
manufacturing and marketing poor-quality products should be
brought to justice. "The businesses should put to a halt and their
licenses be revoked," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts over the past several years, China has not
effectively checked the manufacturing and marketing of shoddy and
low-quality goods, which in some places is still rampant.
</P>
<P>
"If we sit idle and do nothing about it, the country will have
no hope," the editorial warns, noting that it is a must to step up
efforts to fight against the production and marketing of shoddy
goods, and mete out resolute blows at those criminals who violate
the law.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the editorial calls for joint efforts of all society,
composed mainly of industrial enterprises, as well as increased
guidance and supervisory management by government departments.

LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A new survey has found that
more women and minorities are earning Ph.D.s than ever before,
though some said key fields -- from business to engineering -- are

<HEADLINE> Expert: Cult Crimes Must Be Punished (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been revealed that the Falun Gong group has an elaborate
organizational structure, with 39 centers, 1,900 coaching centers,
and 28,000 practice sites across the country, controlling at one
time over 2.1 million followers.
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1996, when it held its first illegal
demonstration outside a national newspaper the Guangming Daily,
Falun Gong has organized a total of 78 illegal demonstrations with
at least 300 followers participating on each occasion.
</P>
<P>
"The April 25 siege of the Zhongnanhai government compound in
Beijing has further exposed Falun Gong's motives that are against
the Party and the government," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He believes the government should take resolute measures to
outlaw cult organizations such as Falun Gong, and punish their
crimes accordingly.
</P>
<P>
To deal with illegal organizations, including cults, the
country has already put in place a host of laws and regulations.
The Decision on Outlawing Cults and Preventing and Punishing on
Cult Activities adopted last week by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress provides a powerful legal weapon to
fight against Falun Gong and other cults, Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
The legal expert stressed that in fighting against the Falun
Gong cult, all law enforcement departments should proceed from the
principle of combining punishment with education.
</P>
<P>
The departments should strike hard at organizers, plotters and
ringleaders, and investigate and prosecute their crimes according
to law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more should be done to help those swindled by Li
Hongzhi to see the true nature of Falun Gong, and to extricate
them from the organization as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the core members of the Falun Gong cult would be
hit hard, their crimes punished and the country's social stability
be maintained," Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Navy Declines to Join Exercise With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli navy has
declined to participate in a joint naval exercise on Monday with a
NATO flotilla visiting Israel's northern seaport of Haifa, the
local daily Jerusalem Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) officials said the
invitation had been given in advance to the Israeli navy. However,
NATO was informed that the Israeli navy will be involved in its
own maneuvers at that time and that none of its vessels will be
available to take part in the search-and-rescue exercise.
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Israeli Defense Force told the daily that
Israeli naval officers are scheduled to go with the NATO's
vessels to observe the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The flotilla, comprising six frigates from Turkey, Greece,
Spain, Holland, Germany and Italy and two destroyers from the
United States and Britain, arrived in Haifa on Wednesday, and is
due to remain until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, known as NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean,
is commanded by R.-Adm Feyyaz Ogutcu from aboard his flagship, the
Turkish frigate TGG Bararos.
</P>
<P>
Ogutcu told the daily that the flotilla was activated in
1992 to serve primarily as an immediate-reaction force for
NATO's southern region.
</P>
<P>
It also involved in the enforcement of the U.N. embargo on the
former Yugoslavia. More recently, it operated in the Adriatic as
part of NATO's efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, comprising 1,600 personnel, makes goodwill visits
to countries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to promote
so-called peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It previously visited Israel in 1994 and has also been to
Egypt, Tunisia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The demobilized soldiers of the
Chinese armed forces this winter will be encouraged to find jobs
in the private sector, while factories and institutions of all
kinds must help re-employ the large number of demobilized soldiers,
the Chinese government has said.
</P>
<P>
according to a recent circular issued by the State Council,

The document says 1999 is a crucial year as it is the first
year of a plan by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee to cut the size of the armed forces by 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should take deal effectively with the
matter in order to help push forward the military reform,
safeguard social stability and push the economic development, the
circular says.
</P>
<P>
It also asks that favorable policies be adopted for those
demobilized who are applying for government posts or studying in
universities or secondary schools.

<HEADLINE> Rural Women's Exhibition Impresses Foreign Female Diplomats, Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua)-- A special all-women team of
foreign guests visited an exhibition touting rural women's
achievements here today.
</P>
<P>
The group consisted of female foreign diplomats to China,
family members of foreign diplomats, representatives from Beijing-
based UN organizations, foreign experts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Ambassador to China Luzmila Zanabria Ishikawa was
deeply impressed with the showing, saying that it is very
important for foreigners to know the achievements of the Chinese
women.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good lesson for us all, not only Chinese women,
but women all around the world," she said, "In the time to come, I
believe there will be more and more successful women in China."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which features outcome of women's development
throughout China's vast rural areas over the past 10 years, opened

<HEADLINE> Expert: Two Giant Pandas Could Produce Offspring in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The two giant panda cubs that
left here Thursday for a 10-year stay in the United States are
most likely to produce offspring there, a giant panda breeding
expert told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"The two giant pandas, one male and one female, are an ideal
couple, and they will most probably have cubs after they reach
their maturity in two or three years," said Professor Li Guanghan,
director of the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that both giant pandas are very healthy also
added to the likelihood of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
The pandas, Jiu Jiu and Hua Hua, are on a ten-year loan to the
Atlanta Zoo in the U.S. state of Georgia as part of an
international research program.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Chinese and American scientists used DNA
analysis testing to determine that Hua Hua and Jiu Jiu are from
different families, aiming to avoid inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the average life span of a giant panda is
about 25 years, and it reaches maturity at about age 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
"The couple will live in the States for ten years -- there is
every reason to believe they will have cubs there," Li added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the research, the breeding base also sent two
specialists to Atlanta along with the pandas to conduct panda
breeding research studies with their American colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered animal
species. It has a very low reproductive capability. A female giant
panda becomes pregnant once a year and has one or two cubs at each
birth.
</P>
<P>
China has experimented with many ways to increase the panda
population and succeeded in breeding the first giant panda by
artificial insemination in 1963. Since then, 12 zoos and one
animal reserve in the world have bred about 140 giant pandas, but
the survival rate has been a low 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
As China's only professional giant panda research institute,
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center has used
artificial insemination to produce 34 giant pandas, who then gave
birth to 50 cubs, but only a little over 30 survived.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 1,000 giant pandas in existence, 80 percent
of them in China's Sichuan Province. Those living in captivity
total over 120, with five in the United States.

<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sedgwick Insurance &AMP; Risk
Management Consultants (China) Limited, a subsidiary of the world'
s largest insurance consultant group, the J &AMP; H Marsh Mclennan,
has resumed business in China after being suspended in May.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
confirmed the development today.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick, so far the only foreign-funded insurance broker
operating in China, was suspended for three months in May by the
CIRC in a campaign to rein in the intermediary market.
</P>
<P>
The company was accused of conducting unauthorized business,
changing office locations without noticing the CIRC and a series
of other questionable moves.
</P>
<P>
In approving Sedgwick to restart business, the CIRC said the
company has admitted its mistakes and taken positive measures to
correct them, and has completed all the tasks in its
rectification program.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick started business in Beijing in 1993 with the approval
of the People's Bank of China. Its licensed business includes
insurance and risk management consultant services to overseas-
funded businesses in China and arranging international reinsurance
for Chinese insurance firms upon request.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Slightly Better This Week in Major Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From October 29 to November 4, cold air current moving
southward slowed down the spread of pollutants over most of China,
thus reducing air pollution in some cities in the north.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the air quality in nine cities including
Nanning and Kunming in southwest China was excellent while 26
other cities, including Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Chengdu,
Guangzhou, Nanjing and Suzhou reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Urumqi, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Taiyuan and
Qinhuangdao reported slightly polluted air quality.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in Xining in the northwest and Hohhot in the
north was polluted, and that in Lanzhou in the northwest was
seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, Hohhot, Xining and 14 other cities blamed suspended
particles as the major pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide was the major pollutant in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and five other cities, while Chongqing, Changsha, Qindao

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Slightly Down in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate slowed down to 5.4 percent in October from 5.7
percent in September, mainly due to the good performance of the
food sector, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The October figure brought the nation's inflation rate in the
first 10 months of this year down to 7.2 percent, well within the
government's target range of 8 percent to 9 percent for the whole
year, the National Statistics Office said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the downturn of the inflation rate to
the strong performance of the food sector, particularly the
miscellaneous foods sector.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rates for food, beverages and tobacco slowed
down to 2.8 percent from 3.6 percent while the rate for food alone
was 2.7 percent in October, lower than the 3.3 percent recorded in
September.
</P>
<P>
Other commodity groups enjoying declining rates were
miscellaneous items, 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent; clothing, 4.9
percent from 5.0 percent; housing and repairs, 8.8 percent from
9.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the office said, rates for fuel, light and
water picked up to 8.6 percent from 8.0 percent while rate for
services climbed up to 11.4 percent from 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Groups that also posted higher rates in prices were cereal
preparations, 3.7 percent from 3.5 percent; fish, 8.9 percent from
8.6 percent; and meat, 2.6 percent from 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the country's month-on-month
inflation rate in October rose by 0.3 percent, compared to the 0.5
percent registered for September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Passes Sweeping Overhaul Bill for Financial Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress on
Thursday approved a sweeping bill for reshaping the financial
landscape by tearing down the Depression-era barriers between
banks, insurance companies and investment firms.
</P>
<P>
The vote in the Senate was an overwhelming 90-8, with seven
Democrats and one Republican saying "no". The House vote several
hours later was 362-57, with Republicans in solid support and
Democrats split.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said he was eager to sign the bill,
despite warnings from Democratic critics that it could lead to
price-gouging of consumers and financial conglomerations that are
simply too big and too powerful.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday, the president said the bill "will help
the American financial services system play a leading role in
propelling our economy into the 21st century, continuing the
longest peacetime economic expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
The legislation repeals the landmark 1933 Glass-Steagall Act,
which erected the barriers separating the financial services
industries, a response to the devastating stock market crash of
October 1929 that triggered the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers wanted to separate investment banking, with its
greater penchant for risk, from commercial banking in a bid to
prevent depositors' money from being lost in high-flying
investments. In 1956, new legislation took banks out of the
insurance-selling business.
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have been chipping away at the legal
barriers in recent years, giving some banks permission to get into
the securities business.
</P>
<P>
Separate versions of the legislation cleared the House and the
Senate earlier this year, and lawmakers and their aides have spent
months negotiating and blending the two. The final package is
closer to the House-passed bill.
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the legislation will save consumers some 15
billion U.S. dollars spent annually on fees and commissions,
offering them greater choice and convenience and spurring
competition.
</P>
<P>
However, critics are disturbed by provisions that would allow
affiliated businesses of the newly merged companies to share
customers' personal financial data as they offer one-stop shopping
for loans, insurance and investments.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Victorian state government
pledged on Friday to keep Formula One's season-opening Grand Prix
in Melbourne although the race made a record loss last financial
year.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual report of the Australian Grand Prix
Corporation on Thursday, the 1999 race suffered the biggest loss
in five years by losing 3.2 million dollars (two million U.S.
dollars), almost double the previous year's loss.
</P>
<P>
But Premier Steve Bracks said the race brought enormous
economic benefits to Victoria.
</P>
<P>
"The new government is committing to keeping the grand prix,"
said Bracks. "We want to keep it in Victoria."

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Tops Short Program at Skate Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Alexei Yagudin beat a
strong field of world champions to lead the men's short program
skate at Skate Canada on Thursday at Saint John, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
The two-time and reigning champion won a standing ovation by
nailing a quadruple toe loop and triple-triple combination.
</P>
<P>
Canada's former three-time world champion Elvis Stojko matched
Yagudin jump for jump but Yagudin won the lead with slightly
higher artistic marks.
</P>
<P>
Another world champion American Todd Eldredge also impressed
the crowds as he delivered an error-free program featuring a
triple lutz-triple toe jump combination.
</P>
<P>
But without a quad, the 1996 world titleholder settled for
fourth behind Chinese quadmaster Li Chenjiang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reigning world champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia led the short program although they
committed three major errors at pairs competition.
</P>
<P>
Berezhnaya fell on her solo jump and she also slipped out of
Sikharulidze's grasp and slid into his arms on a lift.
Sikharulidze then touched his hand to the ice entering a spin.
</P>
<P>
But their artistic performances landed their lead as all but
one of the seven other couples stumbled or fell at least once.
</P>
<P>
Canadian pairs champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz came in
second with Chinese Pang Qing and Tong Jian placed third for their
routines.
</P>
<P>
With the long program worth two-thirds of the total mark, the
pair that is best Friday night will win the gold.
</P>
<P>
In ice dance, Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas of
Lithuania earned top marks for their polka compulsory. Ukraine's
Elena Grushina and Ruslan Goncharov placed second.
</P>
<P>
Skate Canada is the second stop on the six-event ISU Grand Prix
of Figure Skating. The series' top points-getters will meet in a
final showdown in Lyon, France, in January.

BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Yang Zimei, 74, is the first
Chinese to receive an electrode implant developed to cure
Parkinson's disease.

<HEADLINE> EDS-CORRECTION Bulgaria, Romania, Greece Summit on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The document was issued by Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov,
his Romanian counterpart Emil Constantinescu and Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis after their annual summit, which focused
on security, economic reconstruction and development in Balkan
countries after the 78-day NATO bombing against Yugoslavia earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that the Kosovo issue could only be settled through
extensive autonomy within Yugoslavia and urged all parties
concerned to strictly observe existing agreements as a necessary
prerequisite for the success of the peace process in Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province troubled with ethnic problems.
</P>
<P>
On economic reconstruction in the region, the three reaffirmed
their conviction that the future of Southeastern Europe lies in
its integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic political,
economic and security structures.
</P>
<P>
They shared the belief that lasting stability in the region
could be achieved through speedy economic recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing after the meeting, Stoyanov
expressed his and Constantinescu's appreciation over Greek
Minister of National Economy Yanos Papandoniu's announcement that
Greece will provide in five years an aid of 543 million U.S.
dollars to promote economic recovery of the Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Papandoniu made the announcement Wednesday at the conference
for the reconstruction of Southeast Europe in Thessaloniki, Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents hailed the move as the first practical one
within the framework of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stoyanov noted that western countries have not
realized that while they have been "punishing" Yugoslavia, the
neighboring Bulgaria and Romania have fallen into victims.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Constantinescu complained that Romania
has paid a price for the Kosovo crisis far beyond what it can
afford, voicing his worry that the stability pact would turn out
to be a "political contest" for money among the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Simitis spoke highly of the efforts of Bulgaria and Romania in
meeting the criteria of starting the accession negotiations with
the European Union and reaffirmed his country's support in this
aspect.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of Greece also reiterated the stand in favor
of the efforts of Bulgaria and Romania to become full members of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agree to continue their summit meetings on a
regular basis, with the next one to be hosted by Romania in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls For ASEAN Legal Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong Friday called on South East Asian countries for
legal cooperation to facilitate regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the point in his key-note speech delivered at the
opening ceremony of the fourth ASEAN (Association of South East
Asian Nations) Law Ministers' Meeting (ALMM) which brought
together law ministers or their equivalents from the 10 ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that globalization has revealed the close nexus between
economic growth and legal systems, that is, a sound legal system
and effective administration of justice is a key requirement for
attaining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis holds lessons not only for ASEAN's
economic practices and policies, but also for its legal
institutions, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly clear that we need to support our economic
growth with a more transparent and consistent legal regime laying
down guidelines and standards for corporate governance," he said.
</P>
<P>
If sound legal systems are important for each country's
economic development, Goh said, the laws and legal systems of
ASEAN countries must also collectively assist in accelerating and
facilitating ASEAN regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a need to examine ASEAN legal regimes to see
if they are consistent with the provisions of the various economic
agreements such as AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) and AIA (ASEAN
Investment Area).
</P>
<P>
In addition, ASEAN countries should also re-examine their laws
to remove impediments that discourage foreign and intra-ASEAN
investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is another fast-growing area and ASEAN must develop
a predictable legal environment to facilitate e-commerce
transactions, the Singaporean prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to develop a commercial code to deal with legal
issues arising from this shift, such as, the legal status of
electronic contracts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Intellectual property laws will also need to be reviewed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
By saying that, the prime minister noted, he was not suggesting
a convergence of the diverse legal frameworks in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Even if done gradually, it is unrealistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the process of globalization will compel us to move in the
direction of harmonization and coordination," he said.
</P>
<P>
If ASEAN wants to succeed in the new globalized economy,
increased harmonization will help ASEAN to integrate into that
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme for two-day ALMM, an event held every three years, is
"Towards Mutual Understanding of ASEAN Legal Systems."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> 180,000 Illegal Immigrants Deported From S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is now
deporting up to 180,000 illegal immigrants a year to at least 92
countries, according to an official with the country's home
affairs department.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is now at a crossroad in dealing with massive
illegal immigration, particularly from neighboring countries, said
Willem Vorster, aliens control assistant of the department.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Zimbabwe are believed to be the source of at
least 70 percent of all illegal immigrants, most of whom simply
walk through undesignated crossing points at the borders and
settle in the country without going through immigration
procedures, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the report that South Africa had violated human
rights when deporting illegal immigrants, Vorster said, "We have
the interests of South Africans to protect, and we always strive
to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in the most human
way possible, but unfortunately, we can not please everybody."

<HEADLINE> China to Issue Policies for Software Industry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting new policies
to encourage development of the nation's software industry, Deputy
Minister of Science and Technology Xu Guanhua said here today at a
news conference on the appraisal of a geographical information
system (GIS) software.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government wants to create a better
environment for the country's rapidly growing software industry.
</P>
<P>
Xu pointed out that the focus of information technology (IT)
development is the growth of the software industry, while IT will
play a major role in China's economic and social development in
21st century.
</P>
<P>
To boost its software industry, China has decided to reduce the
value-added tax of software and related high-tech products from 17
percent to six percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has established 12 state-level software
production bases which have about 200 software manufacturers. The
building of these centers is part of a major scientific and
technological development program during the country's ninth five-
year plan period from 1996 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Experts here stressed that GIS software is also necessary for
ensuring economic and defense security.
</P>
<P>
The annual appraisal of the GIS software indicated that the
MapGIS, developed by China Geological University, has a mass data
buffer processing capacity 14 times higher than similar software
made overseas.
</P>
<P>
GeoStar, developed and produced by Wuhan University of Geodesic,
Photogrammetry and Cartographic Science and Technology, is
superior to foreign versions because of its superior capabilities
of on-line analysis and map publication.
</P>
<P>
GIS software is widely applied in environmental, communications,
agriculture, aerospace, and military fields.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Cult Crimes Must Be Punished (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Those responsible for
organizing and using cults to carry out criminal activities must
be severely punished, a leading legal expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhenxiang, criminologist and vice-president of the China
Youth Political Institute, noted that plenty of evidence exists to
prove that the Falun Gong organization has every feature of a cult.
</P>
<P>
"Outlawing the cult organization and cracking down on their
illegal activities and crimes has sufficient legal basis," Zhou
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the 1960s and 1970s, various cults have
popped up throughout the world and have gained international
attention in recent years.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Aum Doomsday Cult, which was formed in 1984
in Japan, released poisonous serin gas in a Tokyo subway on March
20, 1995, resulting in 12 deaths and 5,500 injuries. And 39
members of the Heaven's Gate cult in the U.S. committed suicide in
California on March 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dangerous cult activities have been reported in Russia, Ukraine,
France, Belgium and other countries. "This has seriously disrupted
the social stability and development and led to a worldwide call
for outlawing the cults," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, cults were virtually unheard of in China, but
recently a few illegal organizations in the country are showing
more cult-like tendencies, and some have even developed into full-
fledged cults. Falun Gong is one of the most notorious.
</P>
<P>
The criminologist said cults have the following characteristics:
the group defies outside authority; the leader and his followers
fabricate and spread heresies; members are brainwashed so as to be
effectively controlled by the leader; the leader make money
illegally; and the group and its philosophies endanger society.
</P>
<P>
"The outlawed Falun Gong organization has all the
characteristics of a cult," Zhou said. Its founder Li Hongzhi
boasted that he is greater than Lao Zi, Sakyamuni and Jesus Christ.
He controlled his followers' spiritual beliefs, concocted heresies
such as the "doomsday theory" that the world is soon to come to an
end, and that the earth will explode, and made a fortune through
bilking cash from his followers.

PYONGYANG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea and the U.S. will hold talks for consultations
on pending questions between them in Berlin from November 15, 1999,
a report of the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
</P>

The DPRK delegation will be led by DPRK Vice Foreign Minister
Kim Kye Gwan, while the U.S. team will be headed by Charles
Kartman, special envoy for the Korean Peninsula peace talks of the

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation Calls for Pullout of Ugandan Army in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A visiting European Union (EU)
delegation Thursday urged the Ugandan government to pull its
troops out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) within
six months.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Ryeindt, who led the EU delegation, made the remarks
while meeting with Ugandan Deputy Speaker of Parliament Edward
Sekandi, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan troops deployed in the DRC should not stay there after
the six months stipulated by the Lusaka agreement, Ryeindt said,
noting that Uganda's military program in the DRC is causing
trouble for the country's economy because it scares off
investors.
</P>
<P>
Although there is ambiguity in the agreement because of the
security guarantee of the borders of Uganda and Rwanda, it is
important that Uganda pull its troops out of the troubled
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military presence in the DRC has been blamed for the
dramatic reduction of foreign investment in the country. Foreign
donors have been pressurizing the Ugandan government to pull out
of the DRC and give priority to its economic development.

<HEADLINE> Factsheet(6): Shaping up of Australian States' Voting on Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The referendum on an Australian republic would win if a
majority of the voters and four of six Australian states say yes
to the republic.
</P>
<P>
The following is how each Australian state's voting is shaping
up.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales (NSW) -- With more than one-third of the
national votes - at 4,133,205 eligible voters - NSW, with
Victoria, are crucial for the yes vote.
</P>
<P>
NSW has the lowest unemployment of any state (6.9 percent) and
23 percent of residents were born overseas.
</P>
<P>
The push for a republic stated in NSW more than 100 years ago
and, while the state remains the driving force for the yes vote,
it is also the national headquarters of the leading no case
organization, the No Republic-Australians for a Constitutional
Monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Queensland -- Polls have consistently shown Queensland's
2,221,830 eligible voters are more likely to vote no than any
other state.
</P>
<P>
The state has the second-highest unemployment rate (8.4
percent) and the lowest increase in retail spending for the year
to August (3.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
Republicans have all but written off Queensland with polls
putting no support at 10 percent to 20 percent ahead. The
proportion of undecided voters is as high as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the no campaign insists it is not taking Queensland
for granted.
</P>
<P>
South Australia -- With Queensland, South Australia is seen as
the state most likely to vote no.
</P>
<P>
It has the oldest population of any state and one of the
highest percentages of residents born in Britain. It has one of
the lowest increases in retail spending the year to August, at 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite a lack of money and allegations of bias against it in
the local print media, the no side has managed a visible campaign
that may be having an effect. The better-financed republican side
is using the final days to focus on television advertising.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania -- Tasmania's 325,826 eligible voters could be the
key.
</P>
<P>
In all but two of the 42 referendums in Australian history,
Tasmania has voted in line with the national result. The state has
the lowest percentage of residents born overseas (10.2) and the
highest unemployment rate at 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by an independent political consultant found
that 40 percent of the voters in the state thought their fellow
islanders would not support the referendum changes, only 25
percent said they would, and 35 percent did not know.
</P>
<P>
Victoria -- There are about 3 million voters in Victoria, where
support for a yes vote has fallen since the Constitutional
Conventions in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
With one of the highest percentages of residents born overseas
- 23.8 percent - Victoria also has the greatest number of migrants
taking out citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The Victorian republicans have run a strong campaign and argue
that the local political culture with its progressive liberalism
makes the state be more willing to embrace change.
</P>
<P>
Western Australia -- Western Australia now rivals Queensland
which is most likely to vote no.
</P>
<P>
It has the youngest of any state, 10.5 percent 65 years old and
over compared with 12.1 percent nationally and has the highest
percentage of residents born overseas (27.6 percent). It also has
the second-lowest unemployment rate of the states (7.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
But support for the republic has fallen in the past month with
some polls indicating it has fallen as much as 10 percentage
points since January, from a reported 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debate on republic has failed to generate much heat in
Western Australia and with East Timor dominating the news, the
issue has rarely made it into the first few pages of the state's
daily newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounders about Australia's Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian electorate will
vote in a constitutional referendum on Saturday to decide whether
the country should be established as a republic.
</P>
<P>
The following are some backgrounders on the referendum:
</P>
<P>
Backgrounders (1) Yes Case Says Time for Australian Head of
State
</P>
<P>
"It's time to have our own head of state," Yes proponents argue
in the pamphlet, designed for Australia's Saturday republic
referendum and distributed by the Australian Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party's 1972 federal election theme has been resurrected
as the central plank of the Yes campaign at the referendum. The
proponents say:
</P>
<P>
-- "Britain and the British monarchy have served us well and
will always be part of our history.
</P>
<P>
-- "However, the British monarchy is no longer relevant to our
daily lives as Australians.
</P>
<P>
-- "Now we need someone who will proudly promote Australia and
our interests - someone who is one of us."
</P>
<P>
The Yes case argues that only with Australians' own head of
state will Australia be seen to be standing on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Treasurer Peter Costello has become the star
government figure for the Yes campaign.
</P>
<P>
Costello says Australians have lost faith in the monarchy and
are uncomfortable having royalty as a national symbol.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Yes case maintain that the proposed change to
a republic is a small and safe step.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal made by the 1998 constitutional
convention, the country's flag would not be changed, parliament
would operate as normal, the president would have no more powers
than a governor-general.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian president will be very different to the U.S.
president - an Australian president will have an important and
respected position, but with limited powers that will not change
our stable system of government," the Yes case states.
</P>
<P>
Yes proponents counter republicans wanting direct election of a
president by arguing the proposed referendum model is less likely
to result in a politician being chosen as head of state.
</P>
<P>
"The way Australians choose and change our president will be
more democratic and open than the way the governor-general is
appointed (by the prime minister)," the Yes pamphlet says.
</P>
<P>
"All Australians will have the opportunity to nominate a fellow
Australian for the office of president," it says.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutional convention's proposal, a committee
will prepare a short list for the prime minister and opposition
leader to choose a nominee form. That person will then have to be
approved by a two-thirds majority of joint sitting of both houses
of the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
A member of a political party or any member of parliament will
be ineligible for the presidency, which Yes proponents say will
make the position above party politics.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder(2): Highlights of Statements of Yes Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are highlights of statements by major advocates
for an Australian republic, a proposal which will be put before
electorates in a referendum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vote of Confidence in Ourselves (Malcolm Turnbull, chairman of
the Australian Republican Movement):
</P>
<P>
-- Today, no Australian can ever be Australia's head of state,
because our head of state is the Queen (or King) of England. Yet
the British monarchy is no longer relevant to our daily lives as
Australians.
</P>
<P>
-- Becoming a republic is an important and safe step. Voting
Yes in the November 6 referendum allows us to become a republic
with the least amount of change to our present system of
government.
</P>
<P>
-- It is broke. At the moment, the prime minister alone can
appoint, dismiss and replace the governor-general without
consulting anyone. The proposed changes will place a check and
balance against the current absolute power of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
-- We need a say in an Australian president. All Australians
can have a say by nominating candidates and both sides of
parliament need to agree on the final choice.
</P>
<P>
-- Everything else remains the same. Our flag won't change.
We'll still be in the Commonwealth. The prime minister will still
lead the country. What will change is our head of state will be an
Australian president, not the Queen of England.
</P>
<P>
-- A Yes vote will be a vote of confidence in ourselves. The
most significant changes will be in the way we feel about
ourselves and the way we will look in the eyes of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- November 6 is your chance to make history. If you agree it's
time, join us and write Yes on your ballot paper on November 6.
</P>
<P>
The Chance to Move Forward ... in Safety (Andrew Robb, convener
of Conservatives for an Australian Head of State):
</P>
<P>
-- It is broke, and we can fix it: vote Yes.
</P>
<P>
-- A Yes vote on Saturday is an opportunity to preserve the
best of the past and modernize for the future -- an opportunity
which may not come again.
</P>
<P>
-- The ceremonial function is broke. The monarchy is no longer
the life-blood of our constitution, no longer a relevant or
unifying symbol of our nation.
</P>
<P>
-- An Australian head of state would restore a unifying symbol
at the center of our constitution; and it would provide a powerful
symbol of 100 years of steady evolution to what we are today, an
independent nation, which has long been responsible for its own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
-- The model we are voting on is home-grown -- it came from the
constitutional convention last year. It is safe, and close to what
we have now.
</P>
<P>
-- We should seize the opportunity to show who we are, not who
we were.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder(3): Highlights of Statements of No Camp on                 Australian Republic Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are highlights of statements made by major
opponents in the No camp on the Saturday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
Proposed Model Not "Minimalist" at All (Kerry Jones, executive
director of No Republic - Australians for a Constitutional
Monarchy and chairperson of the No Case Committee):
</P>
<P>
-- To call this republic minimalist symbolic change is
deceptive and misleading. Respected Australians who have jointed
the No case ... have consistently detailed the complexity of the
change and the fundamental legal flaws of this republic proposal.
</P>
<P>
-- It should be noted that Prime Minister John Howard does not
want the power to sack the president - on the spot, no reason, no
rules, no impeachment process. Additionally, this dismissal
mechanism exists nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Certainly we know if the Yes case republic gets over the
line almost every new section will be tested and probably end up
in the courts.
</P>
<P>
-- Under this republic, the senate has been weakened through
its removal from the dismissal process. The smaller states are
disadvantaged in both the nomination and dismissal processes.
</P>
<P>
Don't Settle for Less than A Real Republic (Phil Cleary,
director of Real Republic (Victoria state)):
</P>
<P>
-- Of Course, Australia's head of state should be one of us!
The problem is, a president who emerges from a secretive 32-person
committee to be ordained by a parliament where the major parties
hold sway can never look like one of us.
</P>
<P>
-- The direct election of a president, irrespective of its
shortcomings, emerges as bulwark against increasing executive
power.
</P>
<P>
-- Not surprisingly, those who defend the Australian Republican
Movement model accuse the people of being ignorant or confused
whenever they assert their right to elect the president. Clearly,
the people just aren't as stupid as some media barons and members
of the Australian Republican Movement believe. If they don't want
a political, Australians won't vote for one.
</P>
<P>
-- Enlivened by Australian Labor Party MP Lindsay Tanner's
assessment that "there is no fundamental reason why an essentially
ceremonial president with certain reserve powers could not be
directly elected by the people."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder(4): No Case Mixture of Australian Monarchists, Republicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." That is Australian Prime
Minister John Howard's rationale for opposing the republican model
to be voted on in the republic referendum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the No case is more complex than that.
</P>
<P>
It's a mixture of monarchist supporters who want to maintain
the status quo, and republicans against the proposal for a
president to be elected by a two-thirds majority of the federal
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The monarchist No case follows the Howard rationale that there
is no need or gain from Australia becoming a republic. They say in
the No case pamphlet :
</P>
<P>
-- "All legal links with Britain were cut in 1986 with the
passage of the Australia Act through both Australian and British
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
-- "In June this year, our status as a sovereign, independent
nation was reaffirmed by the High Court.
</P>
<P>
-- "Australia is a legally and internationally recognized
independent nation."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter
Reith - one of the key figures for the No case - claims to be a
republican but wants direct-election.
</P>
<P>
Reith also considers the proposed referendum model seriously
flawed because he believes it gives the prime minister greater
power to dismiss a head of state.
</P>
<P>
Firmly in the Reith camp are the so-called Real Republicans,
including former independent federal MPs Ted Mack and Phil Cleary
who are committed to shooting down the parliamentary election
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Cleary accuses the Australian Republican Movement of giving the
nation a phoney republic.
</P>
<P>
"How can we have a republic when the people don't vote?" he
asks.
</P>
<P>
No case advocates dismiss arguments that the people will have
the say in the choice of a president through the 32-member
nomination committee.
</P>
<P>
They contend the committee is just a window dressing exercise
because half of its members will be politicians and the other half
will be political appointees.
</P>
<P>
The No case republicans believe by rejecting the referendum
question the momentum will carry on for a second vote in a few
years' time on their direct election proposal.
</P>
<P>
But if that happens, their monarchist bedfellows from this
referendum could be expected to be enemies next time.

<HEADLINE> NBA Aims to Increase Presence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The NBA is working on plans to
have more American teams playing each other in Asia to boost
basketball international presence, Commissioner David Stern said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Stern said one plan the NBA is looking at is bringing
exhibition games to Japan. The Women's National Basketball
Association (WNBA) games, formed in 1997, would also play a
growing international role, including the possibility of post-
season play in Asia.
</P>
<P>
NBA had started to hold regular season games in Japan every two
years since 1990 and this year the Minnesota Timberwolves and
Sacramento Kings will play two games at the Tokyo Dome on November
6 and November 7.
</P>
<P>
"We're planning to continue the NBA's visits to Japan, and we
hope actually to increase them," Stern, in Tokyo for the 1999
Japan Games, told reporters at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
"The Japan Games are part of the continuing globalization of
basketball," he said. "This is a most international beginning of
the season for us."
</P>
<P>
Stern said the NBA is also thinking of looking for more
opportunities for American players to play with Asian teams.
</P>
<P>
"We must all work together to grow the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
American basketball already has a strong presence overseas. As
Stern said, NBA games this year will be televised in 200 countries,
while WNBA games will be broadcast in 125 nations.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Joint Military Commission Adopts OAU's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese Joint Military
Commission (JMC) holding a meeting here has accepted the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) plan for deployment of
peace-keeping forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is meant to explore ways of facilitating a smooth
implementation of the cease-fire agreement signed in Lusaka last
July.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted OAU ambassador Kidoulaye Corentin as saying on
Thursday that the meeting had proposed the establishment of four
regional JMCs in the DRC to monitor the situation in compliance
with the cease-fire document and report to the main commission in
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said this would allow for the verification of reported
abrogation to the cease-fire by some parties as the commission
will have its own monitors and neutral investigators on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The security assurance document has been put in place and the
JMC is hoping that the troops will soon be deployed in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambia Army Defense Secretary Timothy Kazembe, the
 proceedings are going on well and a number of recommendations
have been made to both the commission and other organs.

<P>
This was disclosed by Dr. Harun-ur-Rashid, project director of
the proposed National Institute of Kidney Disease and Urology.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation as pitiable, the doctor, who was a
kidney specialist, said 96 percent of the patients would die
ultimately as they did not get treatment in the country, adding
that whatever treatment in the country could not be reached by the
common people as it is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
For example, a kidney transplantation required more than
250,000 taka (5,000 U.S. dollars) alone with doctor's and nurse's
fees and hospital charges, and medicine worth 2,000-10,000 taka
(40-200 dollars) would be required every month for transplanted
patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the country's more than 120 million people are
still living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The institute, the first of its kind in the country, was
scheduled to go into operation in June this year and had been
delayed twice due to fund constraints. It was expected to be
commissioned in April next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The specialized kidney hospital would start functioning
initially with 100 beds and later it would expand to 300 beds.
Once the hospital was completed, at least 500 kidney patients
would get treatment there daily free of cost, the doctor was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Refuse KFOR, U.N. Mission Proposal on Joining Kosovo Corps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Kosovo Serbs on
Thursday firmly rejected a call from NATO-led peacekeeping forces
KFOR and U.N. Kosovo mission for ethnic Serbs to join the Kosovo
Corps, an ethnic Albanian security group transformed from the
dismantled illegal Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
Lately the KFOR and U.N. mission passed out brochures to Serbs
in Kosovo Polje and areas nearby, urging them to join the corps
which is said to be established for emergency duties in case of
natural disasters and infrastructures rebuilding, the Tanjug News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Slobodan Tomovich, chairman of the Yugoslav Committee for
Relations with KFOR and the U.N. mission, noting the KLA
transforming as "putting sheepskin on a wolf," asked all ethnic
Serbs not to cooperate with KFOR and U.N. mission on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Responding to this call, Serbs in Kosovo Polje and nearby areas
have said that they will not join the KLA-turned group because "
the KLA had burned down houses of Serbs and driven them out of
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
On September 20, KFOR and the U.N. mission announced the KLA
disbandment and reorganized it into the Kosovo Corps, a move
dismissed by Yugoslavia as "changing in form but not in essence" --
aiming to legalize the KLA presence.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Universities to Join Studies on Mind-Body Relationships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two universities in the
United States said Thursday that they have received a five-year
grant to establish a center for the joint study of mind-body
interactions and health.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the center is to understand how the mind
influences the development of and recovery from diverse diseases,
including infectious diseases, osteoarthritis, early
cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, said the University of
Pittsburgh and Camegie Mellon University in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The grant of 10 million U.S. dollars the two universities in
Pittsburgh have received was from the National Institute of Health
(NIH), which funded four other centers for this initiative.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the establishment of the new center, researchers at
both universities have undertaken individual studies of mind-body
interactions and health.
</P>
<P>
They found that women with increased anger or hostility have a
greater risk for coronary artery disease, and people who have a
larger support network of friends and relatives get sick less
often than those who lead solitary lives. One study shows that
osteoarthritis has the potential to compromise the health of
family members as a result of the patient's negative responses to
symptoms and the burden of providing emotional support and task
assistance to the patient.
</P>
<P>
At the new center, researchers will study the risk for
respiratory illnesses such as the flu which may be affected by the
health of an individual's material and non-material relationships.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on older adults with osteoarthritis, researchers will
determine if the patients and their spousal caregivers experience
greater health benefits from an educational intervention targeted
at both rather than just at the patient.
</P>
<P>
Doctors will also examine women's perception of stress, their
attitude and coping responses as well as physiological reactions
to the stress in their lives as potential markers of risk for
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
Finally researchers hope to learn whether psychosocial
interventions can be designed to enhance adjustment and lower
recurrence and mortality among women with early breast cancer and
to find out the psychological, behavioral and biological
mechanisms through which the interventions operate.

<HEADLINE> Support for Opposition Party Slips in New Zealand Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Support for the Labor Party,
the main rival of New Zealand's ruling party the National Party,
has slipped, turning the forthcoming general election into a
cliffhanger, according to a Herald-Digipoll published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was taken from October 29 to November 4, shows
the support rate for the Labor Party fell to 35.2 percent from
40.2 percent last month, while the National Party's support rate
also dips to 33.6 percent from 33.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
ACT, a potential coalition ally of the National Party, has
risen to 9.2 percent from 5.6 percent. The Alliance, a partner of
the Labor Party has also risen to 8.7 percent from 5.8 percent.
New Zealand First led by former deputy prime minister Winston
Peters dipped very slightly to 5.5 percent from 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of undecided voters has fallen to nine percent from
15 percent last month, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The results of the past year's polls have shown clearly that
Neither the National party nor the Labor Party would win a
majority of seats in Parliament to form a government by itself.
They will have to look for support from small parties in order to
set up a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand general election will be held on November 27.

<HEADLINE> World Hakka Convention Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The 15th World Hakka
Convention opened in Petaling Jaya near here Friday to promote
greater cultural and economic cooperation among the Hakka
community all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Hakka is known as a Chinese clan of several millions living in
various parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Opening the convention, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said the basic economic strength of the Chinese community
has helped Malaysia face the recent attack by currency
speculators.
</P>
<P>
"More important, the Chinese have clearly shown their
willingness to share the bounty that Malaysia offers with the
Malays and the other races in the overall interest of the nation's
stability," he said, hoping that the close cooperation and mutual
understanding among the different races would continue.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the history of Kuala Lumpur would be incomplete
if one did not take into consideration the contribution of the
Hakka leaders who became "Kapitan China" (Chinese captains of the
tin industry).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was pleased that the World Hakka community
chose to have its convention in Malaysia, reflecting Malaysia's
established reputation as an international convention center
attracting leaders from a variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian Hakka community of about 1.5 million had
grown into a cohesive force displaying not only vibrancy and
entrepreneurship but also within its ranks people who have
distinguished themselves in the various professions and in
politics.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 delegates from about 50 Hakka associations
around the world are participating in the four-day convention
themed "Towards Greater Cultural and Economic Cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the convention will hold special discussions on
how to strengthen the cultural contacts and exchanges among the
Hakka community and on how to promote business and economic
linkages and cooperation among the world Hakka community.
</P>
<P>
The world 16th Hakka convention will he held in November next
year in Fujian, China.

<HEADLINE> Embassy Raiders Set to Give up: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The five raiders who took over
the Myanmar embassy here early last month are willing to surrender
to Thai authorities, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted
by the Bangkok Post as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The raiders would be arrested as soon as they set foot on Thai
soil and prosecuted here, Chuan said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"They are outside Thailand. Whenever they come to Thailand,
they will be arrested. We have already issued warrants and they
violated our laws," Chuan said, confirming he had received
information a day ago that the five Myanmar raiders wanted to give
themselves up.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer in charge of the October 1 occupation
of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok was sent to Ratchaburi Province,
bordering Myanmar, Thursday. Seven Thai hostages in the siege were
also instructed to show up at a police station Thursday afternoon,
prompting widespread speculation that the dissidents had
surrendered and had been detained.
</P>
<P>
However, Chuan and other government officials denied that the
raiders had already surrendered.
</P>
<P>
The five Myanmar raiders have been charged by the Thai police
with illegal detention, illegal possession of firearms, robbery
and hijacking.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar closed its land border with Thailand and its waters to
Thai fishermen after the five took over the embassy and held 89
people hostage for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar ambassador to Thailand U Hla Maung said that the
Myanmar-Thai relations would not be normalized unless the five
were arrested and prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Trade Ministers of Americas End Meeting in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The two-day meeting of trade
ministers of Americas ended Thursday in Toronto, with agreements
on a pan-America free trade area, a common front on agricultural
export subsidies and a comprehensive business facilitation package.
</P>
<P>
Canadian International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew hailed
the "united position" of the ministers "to eliminate agricultural
exports subsidies" in Seattle, where a new round of talks of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will open in December.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant achievement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Farm export subsidies by the European Union are expected to be
a key controversial issue on the WTO's Seattle agenda.
</P>
<P>
The issue has long aroused concern for two major trading blocks
in the western hemisphere -- Mercosur, which groups Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, and the North America Free Trade
Area, composed of the United States, Canada and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Reviews Drug Eradication Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Central Committee
for Drug Abuse Control held a meeting here Thursday, reviewing the
country's accomplishments in its drug eradication plan, official
newspaper the New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has started in 1999 implementing a plan, aimed at
eradication of drugs in the whole country in 15 years. The plan is
estimated to cost 5.6 billion U.S. dollars and is being carried
out in three phases -- the first phase is from fiscal 1999-2000 to
2003-2004, the second one from 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 and the
third one from 2009-2010 to 2013-2014.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the first seven months of
1999, a total of 5,150 kilograms (kg) of narcotic drugs,
including 212.97 kg of heroin and 930.2 kg of opium, as well as
13.715 million tablets of stimulant drugs were seized in the
country with 3,844 persons punished in 2,804 drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar official statistics also indicate that there are 61,236
 hectares of poppy cultivation in the country that would yield
665.28 tons of raw opium and could be refined into 66.52 tons of
heroin.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Adopt Forex Traffic Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
adopt the foreign exchange traffic monitoring system in April
2000, especially when the previously planned electronic report
system is ready, according to Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia's senior deputy governor Anwar Nasution said
that the central bank recently issued a new ruling on the
monitoring of foreign exchange bank traffic and non-bank financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that it has taken quite a long time to issue the
foreign exchange traffic monitoring system because the planned
electronic monitoring system requires trained personnel and
well-prepared foreign exchange banks.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, good preparation is needed to anticipate
possible problems arising from the coming application of the
millennium or Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
Y2K refers to problems computerized systems will face at the
turn of the century, when their two-digit-year counters fail to
distinguish between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The glitch may cause computers to shut down or fail to function
properly. Power supplies may drop, telephones and transportation
systems may stop operation and automated banking transactions may
fail.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the new ruling governs the obligations of banks and
non-bank financial institutions, while another ruling will be
issued to govern foreign exchange traffic conducted by companies
or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Bank and non-bank financial institutions will be obliged to
report to the central bank, either information on foreign exchange
transactions or on assets, and on foreign financial obligations in
a full, accurate and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
The information is needed to draw up the balance of payment
charts and to display the international investment position in
Indonesia that will assist in formulating and boosting the
effectiveness of monetary policy, Anwar was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the central bank may revoke the business license
of those disregarding the ruling for six months.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will impose a fine on travelers who do not
report or make incomplete or inaccurate reports, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Planning to Deploy Nuclear Weapons in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Ambassador Richard Miles
said Thursday that U.S. President Bill Clinton would not ask
Bulgaria to approve the deployment of nuclear weapons in the
country during his visit in November.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following his meetings with Socialist
leader Georgi Purvanov and Euro-Left leader Alexander Tomov, the
ambassador firmly denied the existence of such a plan.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported earlier that the U.S. had the intention of
deploying nuclear weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Purvanov said that he got the impression by meeting with Miles
and the media that the deployment of nuclear weapons was a local,
not American, initiative.
</P>
<P>
Tomov said his meeting with Miles made it clear that the U.S.
side had no interest in, and had not discussed with anybody, the
idea of establishing nuclear bases here.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the EU's demand for an early closure of the four
small reactors of the Kozlodoui Nuclear Power Plant, Miles said
that during his visit to the plant he saw it have no problem with
Y2K compliance and therefore he believed in its safety.
</P>
<P>
Tomov said that he was happy with the position expressed by
Miles, which complied fully with the Bulgarian national interests.
</P>
<P>
"Europeans must understand clearly that the closure of the
reactors will incur huge losses on the country," Tomov said,
adding that the government would not allow the decommissioning of
the reactors.

<P>
YANGON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making preparations
for hosting the 12th Administrative Council Meeting and the 20th
Executive Committee Meeting of the Center on Integrated Rural
Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP).
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 13 nations in the region including member
nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will attend
the meetings to be held in Yangon and Bagan, said official
newspaper the New Light of Myanmar Friday without disclosing the
exact dates of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, Myanmar hosted a technical committee meeting of
the CIRDAP which were attended by representatives from 15 nations.
</P>
<P>
The CIRDAP was established in 1979 and the headquarters was
opened in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the CIRDAP are to eradicate poverty in rural
areas, to create new job opportunities and enhance economy and
living standard.
</P>
<P>
CIRDAP member countries have a total population of 1.5 billion,
the majority of whom live in rural areas. The majority of the
rural populace in Myanmar mainly rely on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became the 12th member of the CIRDAP in 1995 which also

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans to Hire Foreign Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) plans to hire foreign coaches in preparing its
athletes for the 2001 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur,
the Jakarta Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
KONI vice-chairman Arie Sudewo said that foreign coaches were
badly needed in the short term as local coaches, who were still
few in number, lacked knowledge in sports science and technology
which was crucial for sports development.
</P>
<P>
"We will hire foreign coaches for the Kuala Lumpur Games. Up
to the 2006 Asian Games, we hope local coaches will be able to
improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
KONI would decide which sports organizations would be allowed
to hire foreign coaches after the council discussed the matter
with them.
</P>
<P>
"Certain sports still need foreign coaches while coaches from
sports like badminton and pencak silat are hired by other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arie said past experience showed local coaches did not benefit
from overseas training.
</P>
<P>
"We have given opportunities to local coaches to attend
training overseas but they have language difficulties," he said,
adding the KONI would open language classes for the coaches.
</P>
<P>
Although KONI planned to reduce its dependence on foreign
coaches before 2006, Arie said that the council would approve if
any organization still needs to hire any.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that local coaches can absorb their compatriots'
knowledge so we don't have to hire foreign coaches. But I don't
have any assumption that we will no longer use foreign coaches
until 2006. We often exchange coaches with our neighboring
countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Opposition Members to Cross Over to Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of 25 members of Sri
Lanka's main opposition United National Party (UNP) are due to
cross over to the government Friday, political sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among them are five members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Others include Provincial Council and Village Council members
of the UNP, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They are to join the government as a UNP group in response to
repeated requests made by President Chandrika Kumaratunga to join
hands with her to solve burning national problems including the
vexed ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Kandy District member of Parliament Dr.
Sarath Amunugama and includes former ministers Wijepala Mendis and
Nanda Mathew.
</P>
<P>
Wijepala Mendis is scheduled to act as the chairman of the
committee of UNP parliamentarians who will join the government, in
keeping with Amunugama's national government concept.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the group said that it was the duty of all
patriotic citizens to assist the president to solve burning
national issues.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to take the decision to branch off because
their endeavor to induce the UNP as an entire party to participate
in this national duty and responsibility had failed, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
majority Sinhalese dominated troops and the minority Tamil rebels
who demand a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has proposed a devolution package to
solve the ethnic problem but the package has been stalled in
Parliament due to the lack of a two-thirds majority.

<HEADLINE> Freight Information Network Due for Trial Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A freight information system
due for trial run on Monday is expected to streamline China's
cargo deliveries, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The number of trucks sent back from deliveries empty or with
deficient goods is on the rise, said Wang Derong, vice-chairman of
the China Communications and Transportation Association, at a
press conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 548 billion ton-kilometers of
freight were shipped by truck last year. One ton-kilometer
measures the total amount of cargo traveled over the total
distance.
</P>
<P>
However, cargo coming to 170 billion ton-kilometers of the
total did not make it to its destination as planned, causing
losses of more than 31 billion yuan (3.7 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the failure to the small scale of freight
enterprises and the lack of shipment information.
</P>
<P>
He said that the operation of the national cargo information
network taking effect on Monday will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Shippers can dial the "126" hotline to ask for services, while
carriers can get the latest freight information via special phones.
</P>
<P>
A national Internet-based data exchange system will also be set
up to facilitate all parties get the same information. The service
can be expanded to the railroad, sea lanes and air cargo as well,
according to Wang.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Romania, Greece Summit on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The document was issued by Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov,
his Romanian counterpart Emil Constantinescu and Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis after their annual summit, which focused
on security, economic reconstruction and development in Balkan
countries after the 78-day NATO bombing against Yugoslavia earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that the Kosovo issue could only be settled through
extensive autonomy within Yugoslavia and urged all parties
concerned to strictly observe existing agreements as a necessary
prerequisite for the success of the peace process in Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province troubled with ethnic problems.
</P>
<P>
On economic reconstruction in the region, the three reaffirmed
their conviction that the future of Southeastern Europe lies in
its integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic political,
economic and security structures.
</P>
<P>
They shared the belief that lasting stability in the region
could be achieved through speedy economic recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing after the meeting, Stoyanov
expressed his and Constantinescu's appreciation over Greek
Minister of National Economy Yanos Papandoniu's announcement that
Greece will provide in five years an aid of 543 million U.S.
dollars to promote economic recovery of the Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Papandoniu made the announcement Wednesday at the conference
for the reconstruction of Southeast Europe in Thessaloniki, Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents hailed the move as the first practical one
within the framework of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stoyanov noted that western countries have not
realized that while they have been "punishing" Yugoslavia, the
neighboring Bulgaria and Romania have fallen into victims.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Papandoniu complained that Greece has
paid a price far beyond what it can afford, voicing his worry that
the stability pact would turn out to be a "political contest" for
money among the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Simitis spoke highly of the efforts of Bulgaria and Romania in
meeting the criteria of starting the accession negotiations with
the European Union and reaffirmed his country's support in this
aspect.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of Greece also reiterated the stand in favor
of the efforts of Bulgaria and Romania to become full members of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agree to continue their summit meetings on a
regular basis, with the next one to be hosted by Romania in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Accuses U.N. of Failing to Protect Non-Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government
Thursday strongly criticized the United Nations peacekeepers and
the U.N. interim administration mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for
failing to ensure the safety of non-Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum submitted to chairman of the U.N. Security
Council and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Yugoslavia pointed
out that the security situation in Kosovo has been grave since the
arrival of the U.N. peacekeepers and the UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
The document said that during the period, 447 non-Albanians
have been killed, 648 others kidnapped and about 330,000 ethnic
Serbs, Montenegrins and other non-Albanians driven out of that
region.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Belgrade held the UNMIK chief, who is currently
Kosovo's highest chief executive, responsible for this situation.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIK chief has made decisions that ran counter to relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions, the document said, citing the
introduction of special currency in Kosovo, the setting up of
customs houses, the appointment of judges and the opening of the
Pristina airport to foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
These measures have infringed upon Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
its territorial integrity and should be abolished immediately,
Belgrade said in the document.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said the signed military and technical accords
should be implemented and that the Yugoslav security force should
be allowed to return to Kosovo to stabilize the situation there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Yugoslavia demanded in the document that the "
Kosovo Liberation Army" be disarmed and disbanded completely and
unconditionally and its leaders be prosecuted for their ethnic
cleansing atrocities.

<HEADLINE> China's Medical Insurance Network Aims to Cover All Urban Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China is working to create a
multi-level medical insurance network covering all urban residents
before the end of the year, according to the China-U.S. Social
Security Symposium which opened here on November 3.
</P>
<P>
It has bee revealed that the reform of the medical insurance
network, launched at the start of the year, aims to cover
employees of all sorts of enterprises in cities and townships,
government departments, public undertakings, and social
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRaeL, a U.S.-
based international law firm, will explore cooperation
opportunities between the two nations in the field of labor and
social insurance.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the ministry said that the medical
insurance network, adapted to China's socialist market economy, is
a continuation of the medical insurance reform and trials in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1998, more than four million
active Chinese workers and over one million retirees had entered
the medical insurance system, combining social pools and
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with the end of the 1970s, when the government
was responsible for the medical payments of more than 75 percent
of China's urban workers, and some 110 million Chinese were the
beneficiaries of free medical service.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Chinese government paid more than 2.8 billion yuan
in medical expenses for its citizens, or some 6 percent of the
total wages of the working class.
</P>
<P>
The official said that although free medical services played a
positive role in safeguarding the well-being of urban workers and
social stability in the past decades, it is not adaptable to the
needs of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The flaws of the free medical service system include heavy
burdens on the state and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the rapid
rising costs of medical treatment, and a lack of a restrictive
mechanism on both employees and employers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with the completion of the nationwide
medical insurance network for the urban population before year's
end, the free medical insurance system and labor insurance medical
system are expected to be gradually terminated after more than 40
years of operation.

SHENYANG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More then sixty beacon towers
and farming tools and pottery including jars and basins, have been
discovered in the cities of Fushun and Liaoyang in northeast China
's Liaoning Province after a year of excavation.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Jingquan, curator of the Fushun Museum, said the beacon
towers extend as long as over 150 km at intervals of 1.5 to 2.5 km,
and are made of clay and stone.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that the pottery, the building materials, and the
farming tools are evidence that the towers were built in the
Western Han Dynasty ( 206 B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
According to the historical record, a large number of beacon
towers were built in the eastern part of the province along the
ancient Great Wall, but this is the first time evidence of such
structures has been found.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Soccer Coach Sacked for Conflict with Key Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Soccer
Federation (FRF) Thursday fired national team coach Victor Piturca,
who has led Romania into the Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal was widely thought to be caused by his conflict
with big-name players as Gica Hagi and Gheorghe Popescu.
</P>
<P>
The conflict started one month ago, when, after the match
against Portugal, Piturca said that team captain Hagi could not
receive a same bonus as other participants in the Euro 2000
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Hagi immediately responded by saying that bonus distribution
was not Piturca's business.
</P>
<P>
The conflict extended in October, when Piturca conditioned his
stay with the national squad by the departure of Hagi, Gica
Popescu and Dan Petrescu.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday evening, Hagi said during a TV interview that
Piturca had been the only guilty person of the tension in the
squad.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to get reconciled," Hagi was quoted as saying.
He repeated the statement before left for Turkey together with
Gica Popescu on Monday. Both are playing for Galatasaray Istanbul
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
FRF adopted the decision to fire Piturca with 12 votes to four
during an emergency meeting on Thursday, according to FRF
President Mircea Sandu. He stressed that the conflict must be
ended and the national team needs peace to prepare for Euro 2000
finals.
</P>
<P>
FRF however praised Piturca success at the post of the national
team's coach: nine victories, six draws and one defeat, which made
Romania qualified for the 2000 European Championship finals.
</P>
<P>
The Federation has yet to decide who will take over the post.
</P>
<P>
Mircea Lucescu, coach of Rapid Bucharest and former coach of
Inter Milan, is thought to be hot favorite for the job. Other
possible candidates include Emeric Ienei, Ladislau Boloni, Anghel
Iordanescu, Cornel Dinu and Dumitru Dumitriu.

<HEADLINE> China's New Securities Investment Policy Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China's newly announced policy
of allowing insurers to buy into securities investment funds has
been welcomed by both experts and the insurance and securities
sectors.
</P>
<P>
They say the move will help insurers enter the stock market
indirectly and therefore will benefit both the insurers and China'
s stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Sin, president of AXA-Minmetals Assurance Co., Ltd.,
said this provides a new investment venue for insurance companies
and will be conducive to their long-term development.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sin said, Chinese insurance firms put their capital
mostly in banks, which have lowered interest rates seven times
since 1996, prompting insurance companies to seek new investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Sin's company has just purchased two million shares of the
Tongsheng Securities Investment Fund, the first such fund to be
invested in by insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
"A wider investment channel may help us reduce operation costs
and risks," Sin added.
</P>
<P>
Experts said insurance companies' buying into securities
investment funds will also increase the capital supply in China's
securities market, which needs more institutional investors,
including insurance firms, to keep it stable and growing.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show Chinese insurance firms generated a
total of 210 billion yuan from premiums from 1993 to 1997, the
bulk of which has been lying idle in banks.
</P>
<P>
This capital now can become a source of long-term investment
for the securities market, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Phosphorus Banned to Keep Lake Pollution-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANHUI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
urged greater efforts to make sure that people living in areas
watered by Chaohu Lake end the sale and use of washing powder and
detergents containing phosphorus in order to help keep the fresh
water lake pollution free.
</P>
<P>
This effort is far from being completed because people still
widely use phosphorus products in their daily life, according to
officials with the local environment protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 9.6 million residents living in areas
watered by Chaohu Lake, and each of them is estimated to use
nearly three kg of washing powder a year, posing a big threat to
the ecological balance of the lake, one of the country's five
largest fresh water lakes.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that one gram of phosphorus can lead to the growth
of 100 grams of algae. The excessive inflow of phosphorus has
become one of the major factors causing the worsening of the lake'
s water quality.
</P>
<P>
Starting on January 1 next year, those who sells phosphorus
washing powder and detergents will be fined, according to a joint
circular issued on Wednesday by provincial departments.
</P>
<P>
All industrial enterprises in the areas watered by the lake are
required by the State Council to reduce their waste-water
discharge to acceptable levels by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jurists Call for Crackdown on Evil Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese jurists say that the
weapon of law must be fully applied in the fight against such evil
cults as Falun Gong to win the final victory.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark at a recent symposium organized by the
China Law Society in Beijing, noting that the fight against Falun
Gong is a serious political struggle to consolidate the Chinese
Communist Party's leadership and the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
She Mengxiao, vice president of the China Law Society, said
that the decision recently adopted by the National People's
Congress to ban evil cults fully demonstrates the principle of
governing the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
"This also indicates that in dealing with the problem of Falun
Gong cult, we have law to rely on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Falun Gong and its leader, Li Hongzhi, not
only have violated China's criminal law and other laws, but also
pose a serious threat to the country's normal social order and
social stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhenxiang, a criminal law expert, said that the Falun Gong,
which deifies its leader, spreads superstition, strictly controls
its members, and has held illegal gatherings around government
offices, has every feature of an evil cult and must be banned
totally.

<P>
HARBIN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Songnen Canal has been
completed in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, marking the
end of the first phase of a large agricultural project in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The Songnen Canal is an agricultural development project in
Heilongjiang which will build a 260-kilometer-long canal
connecting the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers. The canal will then be
used as an irrigation resource and a site for breeding and animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Approved in 1997, the project is expected to cost 1.56 billion
yuan and take nine years to complete. Now that the first phase is
complete, large-scale agricultural development areas and matching
facilities will be created during the 2000-2005 period. The entire
area will eventually become a comprehensive and modern economic
entity.

NANNING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has experienced booming border tourism with
Vietnam in recent years, promoting the region's economic and trade
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Thursday said that Indonesia will support East
Timor if it wants to joint the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"If Timor Leste (East Timor) wants to become a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations after its government is set
up, we will give full support," Wahid was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although East Timor has not become an ASEAN member, Wahid
stressed that Indonesia invited the new country as long as it
recognized Indonesia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum paved the way for East Timor to go
independent after four centuries of Portuguese rule and 23 years
of Indonesian reign. The last 900 Indonesian troops left East
Timor on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, the country's
highest decision-making body, last month ratified East Timor's
secession. A U.N. transitional administration will govern the
territory for the foreseeable future, ushering East Timor into
full independence or self-government.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Impose up to 35 Pct Import Duty on Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to impose a duty on rice imports of up to 35 percent in order to
protect domestic farmers, a minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be included in the next letter of intent with the
IMF (International Monetary Fund)," Trade and Industry Minister
Yusuf Kalla said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IMF's top Asian official Hubert Neiss had no
problem with the tax.
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken with Neiss and he said 'it is okay'. Besides,
there isn't another country in the world that has free rice
imports. By having a zero percent duty, it reduces farmers' desire
to plant rice and would have detrimental effects on the country in
the long term," he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The national logistics agency (Bulog) is expected to have
imported 2.5 million tons of rice by the end of 1999. In
September, Bulog bought 716,000 tons by tender. Another 277,000
tons were purchased in December.
</P>
<P>
"Imports are still possible, but the amount is not as big as
today," Kalla added.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Younger U.S. TV Viewers Least Responsive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to conventional
wisdom, younger TV viewers in the United States are less likely to
be persuaded by TV advertising than older viewers, according to a
new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, according to the study of 2,000 TV commercials,
the youngest category of viewers ages between 16 and 29 is 32
percent less likely to be influenced by TV ads than the average
viewer. The oldest audience group, ages 50 and up, are 21 percent
more likely to be persuaded than the average viewer.
</P>
<P>
This finding is opposite conventional advertising industry
wisdom which says that younger TV viewing audiences are usually
more appealing to advertisers, said rsc The Quality Measurement
Company which conducted the study. The U.S. leading market
research firm, specializing in measuring the sales effectiveness
of TV advertising, engaged large groups of randomly selected
consumers in the evaluation of TV advertising in its labs.
</P>
<P>
The study found that gender is the second most important
demographic in determining how different groups of people are
influenced by TV ads for consumer products. In this instance,
women were 10 percent more likely to be persuaded by TV ads than
the average perception of all viewers, while men, in general, were
16 percent less likely to be influenced.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that influence the habits of TV viewers include
education, employment, ethnicity, income level, the number of
people in a viewing household, the presence of children in a
household, lifestyle and PC ownership.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the most affluent households (upscale
suburbs) were the demographic group least influenced by TV
advertising, while large households with children were much more
responsive to TV commercials for consumer goods. Respondents in
homes, average age of 50 and up with children, were 30 percent
more likely to be influenced by TV ads than the mean respondents.

Kong holds a premier position and has excellent prospects, Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at a luncheon meeting of the Newspaper Society

that foreign investors have great confidence in Hong Kong's
economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully weathered the Asian financial turmoil and

business opportunities available, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed: "Hong Kong's position as a world city is gaining
recognition."
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the world recognizes that "One Country, Two
Systems" has been successfully implemented in Hong Kong and that
multinational enterprises have confidence in this and will
continue with their investments.

fully confident about the rule of law, freedom of speech, the
openness of our economy and level playing field in Hong Kong."

Mark Philippoussis will lead the Australian squad named
Thursday for the Davis Cup final after he makes a comeback from a

LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Thursday
shows that the use of the Internet to negotiate certain financial
products will increase by as much as 12 times in the United States
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth in the use of the Internet to negotiate
loans, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts was dramatic,
said the Association for Financial Professionals, a U.S. community
of 12,000 individuals presenting a broad spectrum of financial
disciplines, which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, while only three percent of the
companies currently use the Internet to negotiate loans, 36
percent said they would do so within the next two years.
Similarly, over the same time period, the percentage of companies
that will use the Internet for derivatives jumps from two percent
to 28 percent and for foreign exchanges from seven percent to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
The association surveyed 825 American companies ranging in size
from those with less than 250 million U.S. dollars in total
revenues to those with revenues greater than 5 billion dollars.
More than 50 percent of the respondents indicated that if sites
were available, they would likely use the Internet as a one-stop
shop for financial services.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks continue to play the dominant role in
providing services to corporate customers, according to the
survey. However, 20 percent of the respondents said that
traditional banks will play less of a role in providing services
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the survey validates its strategic
direction of delivering more products and services over the
Internet. The trend is posing both challenges and opportunities
for financial professionals, as their role is evolving and their
jobs are increasingly tied to information technology, the
association said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Severely Criticizes U.S. Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
sharply criticized on Thursday what he called the policy of
"unilateralism and isolationism" adopted by the United States,
especially the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made when meeting French and foreign experts of
international affairs at the Elysee palace, Chirac also warned of a
possible "bi-polar tension" between China and the United States,
because of the U.S. plan to build a anti-missile shield in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"A new bipolar tension between Washington and Beijing is already
showing its earliest signs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot escape this grave risk unless we carry out a balanced
dialogue between different regional poles of power. This is in the
interests of all," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac blamed the Republican-led U.S. Congress for making
"attempts at unilateralism and isolationism" which are against
"the inititatives in support of the organization of a multipolar
world."
</P>
<P>
"I regret the present disengagement of the United States from
several major fields, because of the decisions of the Congress. I
hope that the United States assume once again all its
responsibilities on the international scenery as soon as possible,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. trade policy has led to many trade disputes with
European Union, and warned of future monetary disputes between the
United States and Europe, which has adopted the single currency
euro.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also criticized Washington for trying to lead
NATO as a world policeman which sits on top of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"France can never accept and will never accept that a regional
defense organization takes upon itself the role of world policeman,
a role which should only be that of the Security Council as is
confided to it by the United Nations Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that because the U.S. Congress has refused to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) banning all nuclear tests in
the world, "the whole system of the fight against nuclear
proliferation is now threatened."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed his concern about the intention of the
United States to abandon the Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty signed in
1972 with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"To jeopardize the ABM treaty could lead to a destruction of
strategic balances and result in a re-starting of arms race," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Government Shows Concern over U.S. Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
expressed Thursday its concern about the possible impact of the
new anti-drug Law recently passed by the U.S. Congress on
bilateral trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new law foresees the possibility that the U.S. president
will order the seizure or freezing of the assets and bank accounts
of foreigners considered suspicious of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The identity of those persons would be revealed June 1 of each
year in some kind of "black list."
</P>
<P>
Mexican government sources said that if that list is published
without control it could damage the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The new law, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives by 385
votes against 23, forbids any firm and U.S. citizen to have any
relation with companies linked to drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
The law foresees fines of up to 10 million dollars and
sentences of up to 10 years in prison to those who make business
with those persons.
</P>
<P>
The list will be drafted by the Department of the Treasury, the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), as well as the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Subcommittee Approves Plan to Abolish INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The House Judiciary
Immigration Subcommittee Thursday approved a legislation to
abolish the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, such business will be taken charge by
separate bureaus for services and enforcement of the nation's
immigration laws, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved by voice vote after the
subcommittee rejected on a party-line vote a substitute offered by
Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lamar Smith, chairman of the subcommittee, said the approved
measure, which is an amended version of a bill introduced in July
by two lawmakers, will eliminate the mission conflict and overload
of the current INS.
</P>
<P>
"We are hearing from every part of the country that the INS has
now edged out the IRS for the agency Americans most want
reformed," said Smith, citing the backlog of 4 million
applications for citizenship, green cards or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, congressional Democrats and
immigrant advocacy groups, which all agree that INS must be
fundamentally restructured, complained that the proposal would
create new confusion.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Wednesday, the administration stated its "serious
concerns" about the amended legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The bill does not provide an effective way to direct,
coordinate and integrate enforcement and service functions,"
Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote to the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, which is INS' parent, would have
oversight of the bureaus of enforcement and service under the
legislation approved Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Overhaul Bill for Financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S Senate voted 90 to 8
Thursday to approve the landmark legislation that would remove
Depression-era barriers by allowing banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
The House was expected to follow suit, and the Clinton
administration has said that President Bill Clinton will sign the
measure. The White House lifted a long-standing veto threat after
administration officials reached a compromise with key Republican
lawmakers on community lending rules for banks.
</P>
<P>
Separate versions cleared the House and the Senate earlier this
year, and lawmakers and their aides have spent months negotiating
and blending the two.
</P>
<P>
In debate on the Senate floor, the Banking Committee chairman,
Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, promised the legislation would
"bring every city and town in America a financial supermarket...
(and) a diversity of financial products that we have never seen
before."
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure, including consumer groups and liberal
House Democrats, are disturbed by provisions that would allow
affiliated businesses of the newly merged companies to share
customers' personal financial data as they offer one-stop shopping
for loans, insurance and investments.
</P>
<P>
But proponents say the bill would save consumers billions of
dollars a year by giving them greater choice and convenience, and
would give the nation's financial services industries a
competitive edge in the world market.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation will modernize our financial services laws to
better enable American companies to compete in the new economy,"
Treasury Secretary Lawrence summers said in a letter Wednesday to
House and Senate leaders of both parties.
</P>
<P>
"The bill will stimulate competition, thereby increasing choice
and reducing costs for consumers, communities and businesses," he
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Eurofighter Marketing Company Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A new company to market the
Eurofighter was set up Thursday by the four European companies
which built Europe's new high-tech fighter plane "EF-2000
Eurofighter".
</P>
<P>
Eurofighter International (EFI), created by Alenia Aerospazio
of Italy, British Aerospace, Casa of Spain and DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace of Germany, aims to win 50 percent of the world market
for fighters, estimated at 800 units over the next 30 years, or 57
billion dollars in cash terms.
</P>
<P>
The four companies have pledged to build 620 units of the
Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that London-based EFI, led by
Cesare Gianni of Alenia, will be responsible for all sales outside
the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The first Eurofighters are expected to be ready for delivery at
the end of 2001. Greece has already pledged to take 60-90 of them,
while talks with Norway are at an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is among a string of other countries that has
voiced a keen interest in the new plane.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Call for Peaceful Solution on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Thursday urged Russia to seek a diplomatic solution to
the conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
They called on Russia to open a peaceful dialogue with
Chechen separatists and said Russia's military campaign could
worsen the region's problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S.-led NATO launched a 78-day bombing
of Yugoslavia, ignoring an appeal of Russia and the international
community for the alliance to seek a peaceful solution to the
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say this indicates a double standard of the West in
dealing with regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, insisting that Chechnya is its internal affair,
strongly opposes the interference of the U.S. in the Chechen
crisis. Even the Clinton administration itself admits that the
issue is Russia's domestic affair.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize at the outset that we recognize Russia's
territorial integrity and its right to respond to threat to its
security," U.S. State Department special adviser Stephen
Sestanovich told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said the West are considering "what helpful
role the international community through the OSCE might play in
the area."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Fischer said Europe was fearful that the
U.S. Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty could
signal a change in the U.S. strategy.
</P>
<P>
Such a signal would make the European countries "very unhappy,"
Fischer told reporters before meeting U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban
treaty, Fischer said the move sent a bad message to other nuclear
states.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is not reflecting a shift in the basic strategy
of the United States," Fischer said, adding it would be "very
serious."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that non-nuclear states were looking to the United
States to provide "some sort of order" in a nuclear world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate rejected the nuclear test ban treaty by a vote
of 51-48, ignoring appeals from the Clinton administration and
governments from other countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton blasted the Republicans who control the
Senate as "new isolationists."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Balkans, Fischer called for consideration of a
lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia. Such a measure could be a
support for the opposition in that country.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer added that he was against lifting the sanctions if
this would help Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and that peace
could only come when his policy of trying to establish a greater
Serbia was rejected.

<HEADLINE> Over 800 Observers to Watch Guatemalan Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 800
international observers are arriving at the Guatemalan capital to
watch the general elections, the first since the signing of the
peace agreement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The November 7 election will become the most watched by
foreigners in Guatemalan history with the arrival of these
observers, said the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein told the press that
the arrival of so many international observers can be attributed
to the fact that the elections will be held after the signing of
the peace accord and because all the political parties are
participating despite their ideologies.
</P>
<P>
Another interesting aspect for the international community is
the rumors of the opposition about a possible electoral fraud,
commented Stein.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Electoral Court magistrate Mario Guerra Roldan said
that there is more unrest and interest about these elections, and
this has caused an increase in the number of observers.
</P>
<P>
The international observers come from different international
organizations, such as the United Nations Organization, the
Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations
Mission for Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The OAS, the European Union and several Latin American
institutions sent 300 international observers for the 1995
elections.
</P>
<P>
There have been already changes of irregularities related to
the upcoming election, despite of the fact that the OAS observers
mission members are arriving at Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The OAS observers have already received 78 accusations from
several parties, according to Miguel Angel Concha, OAS liaison
official in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed Alfonso Portillo, the candidate of the
rightist Guatemalan Republic Frong, is the front runner followed
by Oscar Berger of the right-of-center Party for the National
Advancement, with 46.2 percent for and 29.6 percent against.

LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Europe's three main stock
markets ended higher Thursday after the European Central Bank and

</P>
<P>

measure of the regional market mood, ended up nearly 1 percent at
1362.28.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronically traded Xetra Dax closed up
74.75 points at 5635.62, a gain of 1.3 percent, as investors felt

consecutive day after the ECB raised interest rates for the first
time in its 10-month history.

volume. It also set a fresh intraday high at 4975.11.
